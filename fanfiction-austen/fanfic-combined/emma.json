She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain . She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading . Her way was clear , though not quite smooth.--She spoke then , on being so entreated.-- What did she say?--Just what she ought , of course . A lady always does.-- She said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself . He _ had _ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation . Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material.-- Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his . He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence . He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it . He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill 's engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings . The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his!--Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name . _ Her _ change was equal.--This one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust.--On his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other . It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away . He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.-- But he had gone to a wrong place . There was too much domestic happiness in his brother 's house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning 's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery . He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him .

This is meeting quite in fairy - land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane 's hair?--You are a judge.-- She did it all herself . Quite wonderful how she does her hair!-- No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah ! Dr. Hughes I declare-- and Mrs. Hughes . Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How do you do ? How do you do?--Very well , I thank you . This is delightful , is not it?--Where 's dear Mr. Richard?-- Oh ! there he is . Do n't disturb him . Much better employed talking to the young ladies . How do you do , Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs. Otway , I protest!-- and good Mr. Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do ? How do you all do?--Quite well , I am much obliged to you . Never better.-- Do n't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends ! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted . No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee.--A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,--no hurry -- Oh ! here it comes .

Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . It was almost enough to make her think of marrying . Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change . Mr. Weston might be his son 's superior.-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body 's eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid . There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner . They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable . The ball proceeded pleasantly . The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston , were not thrown away . Every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this . Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . There was one , however , which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma 's wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about . He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room . Escape , however , was not his plan . He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it . He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her.-- Emma saw it . She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all . When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr. Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind - hearted , gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say"}, {"position": [3472, 3480], "text": "? \" to which his prompt reply was"}, {"position": [3494, 3495], "text": "."}, {"position": [3666, 3970], "text": ". \" Mrs. Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat . This was Mr. Elton ! the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr. Elton.-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife . She would not look again . Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot . In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again . His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced . It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles .

As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse 's visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls.-- But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr. Knightley 's absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too . She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself . She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all-- she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person 's company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston , best in the world . Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it . She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do . Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes . That was all very true . Mr. Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could not they go on as they had done ? Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest.-- To Emma 's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley 's , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion.-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs. Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one-- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse 's mind.--It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other-- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . Mrs. Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband 's plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma . How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment -- less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying--\"Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way ."}, {"position": [2658, 2672], "text": "Was he handsome?\" --\"She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."}, {"position": [4459, 4478], "text": "\" \" Yes -- what should hurt me?--I walk fast .

The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . She saw in a moment all the possible good . Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter . Mr. Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. Churchill 's death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma 's side . It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet 's opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it . The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message ."}, {"position": [1824, 2188], "text": "\" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge 's at the time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged-- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . Her spirits seemed overcome . Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:-- confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise-- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . The answer was only in this short note :"}, {"position": [2204, 2396], "text": "\" Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates 's , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her-- but it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried-- but all in vain . Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in ."}, {"position": [2457, 2623], "text": "\" Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note .

She was sorry , very sorry . Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove ."}, {"position": [2896, 2906], "text": "\" said he , turning his eyes towards Jane ."}, {"position": [2925, 2965], "text": "\" But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing ."}, {"position": [588, 764], "text": "Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet , interesting creature .

W. \""}, {"position": [1078, 4114], "text": "If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.-- You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.-- But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent . My courage rises while I write . It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards . This was the fact . My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question . I shall not discuss it here . For my temptation to _ think _ it a right , I refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in Highbury . I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness . Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence . If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband 's son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid . You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _ you _ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father 's compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you . My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point . And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation . With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation.-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought.-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.--I can not deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me . We seemed to understand each other . From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I can not say;--when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree.-- She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part . I can not doubt it . You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize . She frequently gave me hints of it . I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss . While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to . My heart was in Highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion . If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account.-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F-- , who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her.-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to . You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself.-- No description can describe her . She must tell you herself what she is-- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her.-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend . I want to have your opinion of her looks . I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit . Perhaps it is paid already . Let me hear from you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand particulars . Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery . When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle 's generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger . If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet . My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add to this long letter . You have not heard all that you ought to hear . I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult . , as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose . I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.-- But I had no choice . The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be.--It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me . I behaved shamefully . And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W. , in being unpleasant to Miss F. , were highly blameable . _ She _ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough.--My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold . But she was always right . If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.-- Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There _ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis . I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it . She absolutely refused to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable . Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected.-- I was mad enough , however , to resent.--I doubted her affection . I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W. , as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.-- In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible . Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party . Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.-- ` Jane , ' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you . Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority . Have patience with me , I shall soon have done.-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.-- _ She _ _ felt _ _ the _ _ engagement _ _ to _ _ be _ _ a _ _ source _ _ of _ _ repentance _ _ and _ _ misery _ _ to _ _ each _ : _ she _ _ dissolved _ _ it_.--This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt 's death . I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and -- may I add?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at-- : in short , the full direction to Mr. Smallridge 's , near Bristol , stared me in the face . I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing . It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy . For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me.--Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post.-- What was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle . Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.-- I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man ! with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake?--No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her . Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey . A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away . But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment 's uneasiness can ever occur between us again . Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before . A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me the child of good fortune . I hope she is right.--In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F. C.
