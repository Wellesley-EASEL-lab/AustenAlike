Happily for her , they were not many . Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . \""}, {"position": [1646, 1647], "text": "\""}, {"position": [1791, 2884], "text": "This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth 's share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it . Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel ! Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her . She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend . She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other . Their minds most dissimilar ! Where could have been the attraction ? The answer soon presented itself . It had been in situation . They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta 's coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable . That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself . She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment . He had an affectionate heart . He must love somebody . She saw no reason against their being happy . Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike . He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry . The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste , and sentimental reflection was amusing , but she had no doubt of its being so . The day at Lyme , the fall from the Cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate . The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth 's merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . No , it was not regret which made Anne 's heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free . She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate . They were too much like joy , senseless joy ! She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them . The visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned , and Captain Benwick , too , without even half a smile . The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter 's satisfaction . He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him . The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for , and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form , and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure . They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together . He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good . Anne saw them wherever she went . Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral . He was standing by himself at a printshop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she not only might have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice . When he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour . \""}, {"position": [3111, 3112], "text": "\""}, {"position": [3181, 3198], "text": "taking a last look at the picture , as they began to be in motion . \""}, {"position": [3548, 3642], "text": "When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate .

There could be only the most proper alacrity , a most obliging compliance for public view ; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture . In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement . There they returned again into the past , more exquisitely happy , perhaps , in their re - union , than when it had been first projected ; more tender , more tried , more fixed in a knowledge of each other 's character , truth , and attachment ; more equal to act , more justified in acting . And there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery - maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest . All the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end . She had not mistaken him . Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings . Of what he had then written , nothing was to be retracted or qualified . He persisted in having loved none but her . She had never been supplanted . He never even believed himself to see her equal . Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done . He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself . At Lyme , he had received lessons of more than one sort . The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville 's had fixed her superiority . In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa 's could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way . From that period his penance had become severe . He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa 's accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty . \""}, {"position": [1235, 1254], "text": "Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , \""}, {"position": [1263, 1296], "text": "I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . \""}, {"position": [1327, 1348], "text": "I am only waiting for Mr Elliot .

Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife 's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him . Mr Elliot , raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self - indulgence he had become a prudent man ) , and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend 's probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined . The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it . They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that Mr Elliot 's had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known . With a confidence in Mr Elliot 's regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but Mr Elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation . Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her . It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity ; and Anne felt , at some moments , that no flagrant open crime could have been worse . She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence . Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend 's usual state of mind . There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation . She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich . But there was nobody to stir in it . Mr Elliot would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money . She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel , and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law . This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means . To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear . It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne 's good offices with Mr Elliot . She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne 's feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot 's character would allow , when Anne 's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith 's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation . \""}, {"position": [8034, 8035], "text": "\""}, {"position": [8170, 8299], "text": "Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell ! And under such a supposition , which would have been most miserable , when time had disclosed all , too late ? It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved ."}], "character": "William Elliot"}, {"mentions": [{"position":
