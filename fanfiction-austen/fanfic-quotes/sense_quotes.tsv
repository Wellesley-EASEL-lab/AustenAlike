Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	"She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say , and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first . """
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	". "" This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older"
Mrs. Jennings	". "" I have heard"
Mrs. Jennings	", "" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it"
Mrs. Jennings	"But at least , Mamma , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings , but he is old enough to be MY father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . It is too ridiculous ! When is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? """
Mrs. Jennings	"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? """
Mrs. Jennings	"My dearest child , """
Mrs. Jennings	"at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Mamma , you are not doing me justice . I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . He may live twenty years longer . But thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . Confess , Marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? """
Mrs. Jennings	"I had none . On the contrary , if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton . Does Elinor expect him already ? """
Mrs. Jennings	"I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . """
Mrs. Jennings	"I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . """
Mrs. Jennings	"How strange this is ! what can be the meaning of it ! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! How cold , how composed were their last adieus ! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! In Edward 's farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did . Even now her self - command is invariable . When is she dejected or melancholy ? When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? """
Mrs. Jennings	"my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he wo n't keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? "" Elinor"
Mrs. Jennings	"me , forgive me , "" throwing"
Mrs. Jennings	"know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? "" """
Mrs. Jennings	", many circumstances , "" said"
Mrs. Jennings	"can have no pleasure while I see you in this state . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"you will never see me otherwise . Mine is a misery which nothing can do away . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"must not talk so , Marianne . Have you no comforts ? no friends ? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ? Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period-- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with-- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ? """
Mrs. Jennings	"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer 's , where I have been dining . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , """
Mrs. Jennings	"What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! """
Mrs. Jennings	"is charming weather for THEM indeed , "" she"
Mrs. Jennings	"can not be expected to last long . At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer -- nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"any rate , "" said"
Mrs. Jennings	"dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	", my dear , I 'll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"mama coming?-- "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"yet , "" cried"
Mrs. Jennings	"she will be here , I hope , before it is long . It is a great way , you know , from hence to Barton . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"she must not go round by London , "" cried"
Mrs. Jennings	"shall never see her , if she goes by London . "" Elinor"
Mrs. Jennings	"Well , my dear , """
Mrs. Jennings	"and how did you travel ? """
Mrs. Jennings	"Not in the stage , I assure you , """
Mrs. Jennings	"we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr. Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we 'd join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Oh , oh ! """
Mrs. Jennings	"very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Long a time , indeed ! """
Mrs. Jennings	"I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , """
Mrs. Jennings	"seems a most valuable woman indeed -- Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.-- She must have a great deal to leave . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	", ma'am . What is it ? "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"so strange ! But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child . She was sure it was very ill -- it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear , ' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum-- ' and nurse said just the same . But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr. Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy . And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news . So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister 's indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . ' "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"! is Fanny ill ? "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ? "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement . "" At"
Mrs. Jennings	it might .
Mrs. Jennings	"to be silent , "" he has acted like an honest man ! I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal . I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves"
Mrs. Jennings	"about the room . "" Can anything be more galling to the spirit"
Mrs. Jennings	"You and I , Sir John , """
Mrs. Jennings	"should not stand upon such ceremony . """
Mrs. Jennings	"It is a matter of great joy to me ; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly . There are not many men who would act as he has done . Few people who have so compassionate a heart ! I never was more astonished in my life . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Lord ! my dear , you are very modest . I an't the least astonished at it in the world , for I have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen . """
Mrs. Jennings	"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel 's general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Opportunity ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	"They were interrupted by the servant 's coming in to announce the carriage being at the door ; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to go , said,-- """
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	"said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed . """
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	"This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly . Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry , she could not immediately comprehend . A few moments ' reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed;-- """
Mrs. Jennings	"Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings 's speech , neither did she think it worth inquiring into ; and therefore only replied to its conclusion . """
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	"replied Elinor , not hearing much of what she said , and more anxious to be alone , than to be mistress of the subject . How she should begin -- how she should express herself in her note to Edward , was now all her concern . The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world ; but she equally feared to say too much or too little , and sat deliberating over her paper , with the pen in her band , till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself . He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage , as he came to leave his farewell card ; and she , after apologising for not returning herself , had obliged him to enter , by saying that Miss Dashwood was above , and wanted to speak with him on very particular business . Elinor had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity , that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter , it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth , when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all . Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance . She had not seen him before since his engagement became public , and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it ; which , with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of , and what she had to tell him , made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes . He too was much distressed ; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room , he could not recollect ; but determining to be on the safe side , he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing , after taking a chair . """
Mrs. Jennings	"said Elinor , recovering herself , and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible , """
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	"Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it . For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak;--at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said , """
Mrs. Jennings	"Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on HIS , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it . """
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	"cried Mrs. Jennings ; """
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	"said Elinor , """
Mrs. Jennings	"said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , """
Mrs. Jennings	"Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . 41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life . Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas . So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood 's part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry . It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife 's indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions . Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike . Mrs. Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out . He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in . They walked up stairs in to the drawing - room.--Nobody was there . "" Fanny"
Mrs. Jennings	""""
Mrs. Jennings	"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood 's is not , """
Mrs. Jennings	"for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes . """
Mrs. Jennings	", Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it . Do n't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n't put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"have a notion , "" said"
Mrs. Jennings	"Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	", "" cried"
Mrs. Jennings	"am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . "" """
Mrs. Jennings	"thank you , ma'am , sincerely thank you , "" said"
Mrs. Jennings	"invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,--I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . "" Mrs."

Sir John Middleton	", is HE in the country ? That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . "" """
Sir John Middleton	"know him then , "" said"

Sir John Middleton	"what sort of a young man is he ? "" """
Sir John Middleton	"good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you . A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England . "" """
Sir John Middleton	"my soul , "" said"
Sir John Middleton	"do not know much about him as to all THAT . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . Was she out with him today ? "" But"
Sir John Middleton	", yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . "" """
Sir John Middleton	"do not believe , "" said"
Sir John Middleton	"is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , "" repeated"
Sir John Middleton	"remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o'clock till four , without once sitting down . "" """
Sir John Middleton	"he indeed ? "" cried"
Sir John Middleton	"with elegance , with spirit ? "" """
Sir John Middleton	"; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . "" """
Sir John Middleton	"is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be . Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . "" """
Sir John Middleton	", aye , I see how it will be , "" said"
Sir John Middleton	"see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon . "" """
Sir John Middleton	", you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . """
Sir John Middleton	"You MUST drink tea with us to night , """
Sir John Middleton	"for we shall be quite alone -- and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . """
Sir John Middleton	"I wish with all my soul , """
Sir John Middleton	"that Willoughby were among us again . """
Sir John Middleton	", "" said"
Sir John Middleton	"have brought you some strangers . How do you like them ? "" """
Sir John Middleton	"mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way . "" As"
Sir John Middleton	"Palmer made her no answer , and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper . "" Mr."
Sir John Middleton	"was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood ; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one , and could not help looking with surprise at them both . Mrs. Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told . Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment , and every body agreed , two or three times over , that it had been quite an agreeable surprise . "" You"
Sir John Middleton	"Mrs. Jennings . Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper . "" No"
Sir John Middleton	"replied , and read on . "" Here"
Sir John Middleton	"A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly 's puppies ! and this was the end of it ! """
Sir John Middleton	than
Sir John Middleton	"The rest of the company soon dropt in . """

Marianne Dashwood	"A woman of seven and twenty , """
Marianne Dashwood	"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . It would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied . In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other . """
Marianne Dashwood	"But he talked of flannel waistcoats , """
Marianne Dashwood	"and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . """

Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor said no more , and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before , directly ran over the contents of all . The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect . Berkeley Street , January . """
Marianne Dashwood	"No , no , """
Marianne Dashwood	"misery such as mine has no pride . I care not who knows that I am wretched . The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like -- may resist insult , or return mortification -- but I can not . I must feel -- I must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . """
Marianne Dashwood	"But for my mother 's sake and mine-- """
Marianne Dashwood	"When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength , """
Marianne Dashwood	"we will take long walks together every day . We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to Sir John 's new plantations at Barton Cross , and the Abbeyland ; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached . I know we shall be happy . I know the summer will pass happily away . I mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading . I have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study . Our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement . But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon . By reading only six hours a - day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve - month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" As for regret ,"
Marianne Dashwood	""" I have done with that , as far as HE is concerned . I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him , but what they are NOW.--At present , if I could be satisfied on one point , if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part , not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all , if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him , since the story of that unfortunate girl""-- She stopt . Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered ,"
Marianne Dashwood	""""
Marianne Dashwood	""" I would suppose him,--Oh , how gladly would I suppose him , only fickle , very , very fickle ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" I am not wishing him too much good ,"
Marianne Dashwood	""" when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own . He will suffer enough in them ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Do you compare your conduct with his ?"
Marianne Dashwood	""" No . I compare it with what it ought to have been ; I compare it with yours ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Our situations have borne little resemblance ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not , my dearest Elinor , let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure . My illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection . Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect . I considered the past : I saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others . I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave . My illness , I well knew , had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health , as I had felt even at the time to be wrong . Had I died,--it would have been self - destruction . I did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my God , and to you all , did not kill me at once . Had I died,-- in what peculiar misery should I have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister!--You , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too ! How could you have consoled her!--I can not express my own abhorrence of myself . Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . Every body seemed injured by me . The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt . To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention.--To John , to Fanny,--yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . But you,--you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me . I , and only I , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before me ; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort ? Did I imitate your forbearance , or lessen your restraints , by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;-- not less when I knew you to be unhappy , than when I had believed you at ease , did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship ; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me , regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me , and leaving you , for or I professed an unbounded affection , to be miserable for my sake ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" You are very good.--The future must be my proof . I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it -- my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself . I shall now live solely for my family . You , my mother , and Margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you . > From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance . As for Willoughby -- to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle . His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions . But it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" If I could but know HIS heart , everything would become easy ."
Marianne Dashwood	"I wish to assure you both , """
Marianne Dashwood	"that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do . """
Marianne Dashwood	"It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear . ""--For some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before--""I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change . I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this.--I should have had no confidence , no esteem . Nothing could have done it away to my feelings . """
Marianne Dashwood	"Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men!--No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt .

Marianne Dashwood	"You must not enquire too far , Marianne -- remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility -- and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque . """
Marianne Dashwood	"I am afraid it is but too true , """
Marianne Dashwood	"but why should you boast of it ? """
Marianne Dashwood	"It is very true , """
Marianne Dashwood	"that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was .

Mr. Palmer looked up on her entering the room , stared at her some minutes , and then returned to his newspaper . Mrs. Palmer 's eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room . She got up to examine them . "" Oh"

Marianne Dashwood	"This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them . From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident . Margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and Margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves .

She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard three"

Marianne Dashwood	"I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour . But why should you dislike him ? """
Marianne Dashwood	"I do not dislike him . I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body 's good word , and nobody 's notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . """
Marianne Dashwood	"Add to which , """
Marianne Dashwood	"that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . """
Marianne Dashwood	"are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne 's , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . "" After"
Marianne Dashwood	"my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment 's being pardonable . "" """
Marianne Dashwood	", "" said"
Marianne Dashwood	"not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances""-- Here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered Elinor 's head . The lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips . As it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard . Elinor attempted no more . But Marianne , in her place , would not have done so little . The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Elinor , pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive , though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner , said no more ; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could , while Marianne still remained on the bed , was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it . When there , though looking most wretchedly , she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected . Had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings 's well - meant but ill - judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her . Elinor , who did justice to Mrs. Jennings 's kindness , though its effusions were often distressing , and sometimes almost ridiculous , made her those acknowledgments , and returned her those civilities , which her sister could not make or return for herself . Their good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy , and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so . She treated her therefore , with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays . Marianne was to have the best place by the fire , was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house , and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day . Had not Elinor , in the sad countenance of her sister , seen a check to all mirth , she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings 's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love , by a variety of sweetmeats and olives , and a good fire . As soon , however , as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on Marianne , she could stay no longer . With a hasty exclamation of Misery , and a sign to her sister not to follow her , she directly got up and hurried out of the room ."

I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . """
Marianne Dashwood	"Months ! """
Marianne Dashwood	"No -- nor many weeks . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" She walked eagerly on as she spoke ; and Elinor , to screen Marianne from particularity , as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby , quickened her pace and kept up with her . They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman . Marianne looked again ; her heart sunk within her ; and abruptly turning round , she was hurrying back , when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her ; a third , almost as well known as Willoughby 's , joined them in begging her to stop , and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars . He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby ; the only one who could have gained a smile from her ; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM , and in her sister 's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment . He dismounted , and giving his horse to his servant , walked back with them to Barton , whither he was purposely coming to visit them . He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality , but especially by Marianne , who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself . To Marianne , indeed , the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour . On Edward 's side , more particularly , there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion . He was confused , seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them , looked neither rapturous nor gay , said little but what was forced from him by questions , and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection . Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise . She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward ; and it ended , as every feeling must end with her , by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby , whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect . After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting , Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London . No , he had been in Devonshire a fortnight ."

But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil . But I ca n't bear to see them dirty and nasty . Now there 's Mr. Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr. Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ?

Marianne Dashwood	"London!--and are you going this morning ? "" """
Marianne Dashwood	"this moment . "" """
Marianne Dashwood	"is very unfortunate . But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . "" He"
Marianne Dashwood	"is Mrs. Smith your only friend ? Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ? For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? "" His"
Marianne Dashwood	"I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it . I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , be might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character;--but I will not raise objections against any one 's conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . """
Marianne Dashwood	"You speak very properly . Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected . Though WE have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case . It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable . """
Marianne Dashwood	"Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor DID think the question a very odd one , and her countenance expressed it , as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars . """
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	"returned Elinor , cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward 's mother , and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity-- """
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	"said Lucy , eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke ; """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor made her a civil reply , and they walked on for a few minutes in silence . It was broken by Lucy , who renewed the subject again by saying , with some hesitation , """
Elinor Dashwood	"said Elinor , in great astonishment , """
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	""" I think I have ,"

Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	""" replied Elinor , startled by the question ;"
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	""" repeated Lucy ."
Elinor Dashwood	"said Lady Middleton to Elinor ; """
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals , and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise , gained her own end , and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time . Lucy made room for her with ready attention , and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table , and , with the utmost harmony , engaged in forwarding the same work . The pianoforte at which Marianne , wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts , had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself , was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely , under the shelter of its noise , introduce the interesting subject , without any risk of being heard at the card - table .
Elinor Dashwood	"He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time . Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . """
Elinor Dashwood	"He did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear Fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . He could hardly suppose I should neglect them . But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time . The promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Well , then , LET something be done for them ; but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds . Consider , """
Elinor Dashwood	"that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . Your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . If , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy-- """
Elinor Dashwood	"To be sure it would . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"Oh ! beyond anything great ! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if REALLY his sisters ! And as it is -- only half blood!--But you have such a generous spirit ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"I would not wish to do any thing mean , """
Elinor Dashwood	"One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . """
Elinor Dashwood	"There is no knowing what THEY may expect , """
Elinor Dashwood	"but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Certainly -- and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . As it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother 's death -- a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . """
Elinor Dashwood	"To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds . """
Elinor Dashwood	"That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable . """
Elinor Dashwood	"To be sure , """
Elinor Dashwood	"it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . But , then , if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Fifteen years ! my dear Fanny ; her life can not be worth half that purchase . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . You are not aware of what you are doing . I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father 's will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . My mother was quite sick of it . Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother 's disposal , without any restriction whatever . It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should by no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . It will certainly be much the best way . A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . """
Elinor Dashwood	"To be sure it will . Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . The assistance he thought of , I dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . I 'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did . Do but consider , my dear Mr. Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that?--They will live so cheap ! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all . They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! Only conceive how comfortable they will be ! Five hundred a year ! I am sure I can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . They will be much more able to give YOU something . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Certainly , """
Elinor Dashwood	"But , however , ONE thing must be considered . When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . """
Elinor Dashwood	"That is a material consideration undoubtedly . A valuable legacy indeed ! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place THEY can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is . Your father thought only of THEM . And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM .

"" """
Elinor Dashwood	", "" said"
Elinor Dashwood	"may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mamma , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference!"" -- """

Elinor Dashwood	""" cried Elinor ;"
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	""" said Elinor ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject , but the approach of her own party made another more necessary ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind . Edward 's marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain , as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance . As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs. Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known . The continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two - penny post from Lucy herself . It was as follows :"
Elinor Dashwood	""" I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another 's love . We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it . I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings wo n't think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""" As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer 's real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" 39 The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne 's impatience to be gone increased every day . She sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , Barton must do it . Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March , for the Easter holidays ; and Mrs. Jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them . This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure . When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , I can not go to Cleveland . ""--"
Elinor Dashwood	""" said Elinor gently ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	""" Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;--represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day 's journey ; and their mother 's servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ' time . As Marianne 's affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started . Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland . Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother 's concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . This set the matter beyond a doubt . She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest . They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne 's performance brought her these words in the Colonel 's calm voice,--"
Elinor Dashwood	", "" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you"
Elinor Dashwood	". "" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty,""--he replied , with great feeling,--""of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to . I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more . I understand that he intends to take orders . Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day 's post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable.-- It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income . Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting him to it , will be very great . Pray assure him of it"
Elinor Dashwood	". "" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least , I am afraid it can not take place very"
Elinor Dashwood	"Infirmity ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"Perhaps , """
Elinor Dashwood	"thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon 's being thirty - five any objection to his marrying HER . """
Elinor Dashwood	"It would be impossible , I know , """
Elinor Dashwood	"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Mamma , """
Elinor Dashwood	"I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I can not conceal from you . I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well . We have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . What else can detain him at Norland ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"Good heavens ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"he is there -- he is there -- Oh ! why does he not look at me ? why can not I speak to him ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"Pray , pray be composed , """
Elinor Dashwood	"and do not betray what you feel to every body present . Perhaps he has not observed you yet . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Good God ! Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ? Have you not received my letters ? Will you not shake hands with me ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home . My card was not lost , I hope . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Here is some mistake I am sure -- some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven 's sake tell me , what is the matter ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"Go to him , Elinor , """
Elinor Dashwood	"and force him to come to me . Tell him I must see him again -- must speak to him instantly.-- I can not rest -- I shall not have a moment 's peace till this is explained -- some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him this moment . """

Elinor Dashwood	"shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how can you talk so ?

I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . You had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one . We were last night at Lady Middleton 's , where there was a dance . I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ? You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise . """
Elinor Dashwood	"The contents of her last note to him were these:-- """
Elinor Dashwood	"M.D. """
Elinor Dashwood	"I felt myself , """
Elinor Dashwood	"to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I can believe it , """
Elinor Dashwood	"but unfortunately he did not feel the same . """
Elinor Dashwood	"He DID feel the same , Elinor -- for weeks and weeks he felt it . I know he did . Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? The morning that we parted too ! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can I ever forget his distress ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"By all the world , rather than by his own heart . I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . This woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I would do more than for my own . But to appear happy when I am so miserable -- Oh ! who can require it ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"It is too much ! Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours ! Cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you . Elinor , nothing can . Whatever he might have heard against me-- ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? ' The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable . Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? Oh , barbarously insolent!--Elinor , can he be justified ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"No , Marianne , in no possible way . """
Elinor Dashwood	"And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been?--how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh ! no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , I must go home . I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"To - morrow , Marianne ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"Yes , why should I stay here ? I came only for Willoughby 's sake -- and now who cares for me ? Who regards me ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"It would be impossible to go to - morrow . We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . The Middletons and Palmers -- how am I to bear their pity ? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton ! Oh , what would HE say to that ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" How then ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""" would you account for his behaviour ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Tell mama ,"
Elinor Dashwood	"You consider the matter , """
Elinor Dashwood	"exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain . Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self - denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that-- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"I suspect , """
Elinor Dashwood	"that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . """

You want nothing but patience -- or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent .

I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again""-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John . Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton , and totally unlike her in every respect . She was short and plump , had a very pretty face , and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be . Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister 's , but they were much more prepossessing . She came in with a smile , smiled all the time of her visit , except when she laughed , and smiled when she went away . Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty , with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife , but of less willingness to please or be pleased . He entered the room with a look of self - consequence , slightly bowed to the ladies , without speaking a word , and , after briefly surveying them and their apartments , took up a newspaper from the table , and continued to read it as long as he staid . Mrs. Palmer , on the contrary , who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy , was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth .

Elinor Dashwood	"When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma'am ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"I wrote to him , my love , last week , and rather expect to see , than to hear from him again . I earnestly pressed his coming to us , and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow , or any day . """

Margaret 's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister .

Elinor Dashwood	"Marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that we had been out in my curricle ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am afraid ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house . They will one day be Mr. Willoughby 's , and--"
Elinor Dashwood	""" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . It is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . On one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England ."
Elinor Dashwood	"She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL , """
Elinor Dashwood	"But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD . """
Elinor Dashwood	"There now , """
Elinor Dashwood	"everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I can not think why . My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour 's end to another . ' Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy , ' my cousin said t'other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I -- I can not think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Aye , aye , that is very pretty talking -- but it wo n't do-- the Doctor is the man , I see . """
Elinor Dashwood	"No , indeed ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , """
Elinor Dashwood	"No , I do not think we shall . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Oh , yes , I dare say you will . """
Elinor Dashwood	"What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"Why , their visit is but just begun ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"I am sorry she is not well-- """
Elinor Dashwood	"You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Oh , if that 's all , """
Elinor Dashwood	"we can just as well go and see HER . """
Elinor Dashwood	"wished very much to call upon you yesterday , "" said"
Elinor Dashwood	"it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars . Harry was vastly pleased . THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal . But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings . I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to THEM . As my mother - in - law 's relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect .

And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing .

Elinor Dashwood	"are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side -- in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable-- you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family . It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that""--lowering his voice to an important whisper--""will be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES . "" Recollecting"
Elinor Dashwood	"is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . He has a most excellent mother . Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds . A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time . A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit . To give you another instance of her liberality:--The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny 's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . And extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here . "" He"
Elinor Dashwood	"expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"so large , I dare say , as many people suppose . I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live . The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it . I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . A man must pay for his convenience ; and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"than you think it really and intrinsically worth . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	", I hope not that . I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker 's hands , I must have sold out to very great loss . "" Elinor"
Elinor Dashwood	"great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away . You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars 's kindness is . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	", "" said"
Elinor Dashwood	"assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"year or two may do much towards it , "" he"
Elinor Dashwood	"however there is still a great deal to be done . There is not a stone laid of Fanny 's green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"is the green - house to be ? "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"the knoll behind the house . The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . "" Elinor"
Elinor Dashwood	"shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , "" said"
Elinor Dashwood	"Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . """

Mrs. Ferrars too -- in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress -- but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome . Poor Fanny ! she was in hysterics all yesterday . But I would not alarm you too much . Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended ; her constitution is a good one , and her resolution equal to any thing . She has borne it all , with the fortitude of an angel ! She says she never shall think well of anybody again ; and one can not wonder at it , after being so deceived!-- meeting with such ingratitude , where so much kindness had been shewn , so much confidence had been placed ! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter . And now to be so rewarded ! ' I wish , with all my heart , ' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way , ' that we had asked your sisters instead"
Elinor Dashwood	""" he continued , "" was urged in vain . Edward said very little ; but what he did say , was in the most determined manner . Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement . He would stand to it , cost him"

Elinor Dashwood	"of him ? "" "" What , indeed , ma'am ! It is a melancholy consideration . Born to the prospect of such affluence ! I can not conceive a situation more deplorable .

But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic .

In the drawing - room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings , with a wine - glass , full of something , in her hand ."

Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea , and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne , Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there , and , in short , that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence . Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought ; for soon after his entrance , she walked across the room to the tea - table where Elinor presided , and whispered--"

MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and HERS must be gained by it in time . Pray , pray let me hear it . """
Elinor Dashwood	"You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October,--but this will give you no idea -- I must go farther back . You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin . A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it SHALL be a short one . On such a subject , """
Elinor Dashwood	"can I have little temptation to be diffuse . """
Elinor Dashwood	"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation-- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Indeed , """
Elinor Dashwood	"I have NOT forgotten it . """
Elinor Dashwood	"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . The same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father . Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Her 's , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever . She was married -- married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered . And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly I relate ! I have never told you how this was brought on . We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland . The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin 's maid betrayed us . I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father 's point was gained . I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one-- but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it . This however was not the case . My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon 's , was but too natural . She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ? Had I remained in England , perhaps -- but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , """
Elinor Dashwood	"was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered-- """
Elinor Dashwood	"Good heavens ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"could it be -- could Willoughby!"" --"
Elinor Dashwood	""" he continued ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	""" exclaimed Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" said she ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this ; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Miss Dashwood , for half an hour -- for ten minutes-- I entreat you to stay . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Had they told me , """
Elinor Dashwood	"that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door . My business is with you , and only you . """
Elinor Dashwood	"With me!"" --in the utmost amazement--""well , sir,-- be quick -- and if you can -- less violent ."

Elinor Dashwood	"by saying , "" It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on"
Elinor Dashwood	"subject . "" "" I insist on you hearing the whole"
Elinor Dashwood	"he replied , "" My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . Every year since my coming of age , or even before , I believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , Mrs. Smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re - establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty-- which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much -- I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love . But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice?--or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers?-- But I have done it . To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it"
Elinor Dashwood	"blessing . "" "" You"
Elinor Dashwood	"little softened , "" believe yourself at one time attached"
Elinor Dashwood	"her ? "" "" To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have done it?--Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless . Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed . I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound . The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever . At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display . But in the interim -- in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private-- a circumstance occurred -- an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort . A discovery took place,""--here he hesitated and looked down.--""Mrs . Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain"
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor first spoke . "" Did you tell her that you"
Elinor Dashwood	"soon return ? "" "" I do not know what"
Elinor Dashwood	"replied , impatiently ; "" less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future . I can not think of it.--It wo n't do.--Then came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence . Thank Heaven ! it DID torture me . I was miserable . Miss Dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery . I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now . Well , I went , left all that I loved , and went to those to whom , at best , I was only indifferent . My journey to town -- travelling with my own horses , and therefore so tediously -- no creature to speak to -- my own reflections so cheerful -- when I looked forward every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton , the picture so soothing!--oh , it was"
Elinor Dashwood	"that passed . "" "" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time , ) what I felt is-- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion-- my feelings were very , very painful.--Every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart . To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language-- a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure"
Elinor Dashwood	"from me . "" "" You are very wrong , Mr. Willoughby"
Elinor Dashwood	"her compassionate emotion ; "" you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister . You had made your own choice . It was not forced on you . Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you . To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne -- nor can I suppose it a relief to"
Elinor Dashwood	"own conscience . "" "" Do not talk to me"
Elinor Dashwood	"with a heavy sigh.-- "" She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no regard for her when we married.--Well , married we were , and came down to Combe Magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me , Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?-- Am I -- be it only one degree -- am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong . Have I explained away any part"
Elinor Dashwood	"my guilt ? "" "" Yes , you have certainly removed something -- a little.-- You have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than I had believed you . You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked . But I hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- I hardly know what could have"
Elinor Dashwood	"it worse . "" "" Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . You tell me that she has forgiven me already . Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness . Tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to"
Elinor Dashwood	"than ever . "" "" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard"
Elinor Dashwood	"going , and said-- "" There is no use in staying here ; I"
Elinor Dashwood	"be off . "" "" Are you going"
Elinor Dashwood	"to town ? "" "" No -- to Combe Magna . I have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two"
Elinor Dashwood	"of the two . "" Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given;--but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off"
Elinor Dashwood	"of seeing her . "" Here , however , Elinor perceived,--not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother 's active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her"

Elinor Dashwood	is
Elinor Dashwood	"her mother seriously , "" or after such a warning , I should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the"
Elinor Dashwood	"of men . "" "" His"
Elinor Dashwood	""" answered Elinor , "" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him . To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow"
Elinor Dashwood	"to hope ? "" "" Oh ! my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself . Marianne might at that moment be dying . But he did not ask for hope or encouragement . His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend -- not an application to a parent . Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power . Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;--Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must"
Elinor Dashwood	"secure it . "" "" To judge from the Colonel 's spirits , however , you have not yet made"
Elinor Dashwood	"equally sanguine . "" "" No.--He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed;--and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I"
Elinor Dashwood	"assent , continued , "" And his manners , the Colonel 's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby 's ever were , but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne . Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be"
Elinor Dashwood	"gave no offence . "" At Delaford , she will be within an easy"
Elinor Dashwood	"added Mrs. Dashwood , "" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as"
Elinor Dashwood	"spirit was stubborn . "" His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be"
Elinor Dashwood	"Grandeur has but little , """
Elinor Dashwood	"but wealth has much to do with it . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Perhaps , """
Elinor Dashwood	"we may come to the same point . YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"Certainly , """
Elinor Dashwood	"he seems very agreeable . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Well -- I am so glad you do . I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you ca n't think how disappointed he will be if you do n't come to Cleveland.--I ca n't imagine why you should object to it . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Sir John could not prevail . He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two , and then left them in amazement at their indifference , to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles , as he had been already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them . When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place , they found in the appearance of the eldest , who was nearly thirty , with a very plain and not a sensible face , nothing to admire ; but in the other , who was not more than two or three and twenty , they acknowledged considerable beauty ; her features were pretty , and she had a sharp quick eye , and a smartness of air , which though it did not give actual elegance or grace , gave distinction to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil , and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense , when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton . With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight . Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles , a fond mother , though , in pursuit of praise for her children , the most rapacious of human beings , is likewise the most credulous ; her demands are exorbitant ; but she will swallow any thing ; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust . She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted . She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing . "" John"
Elinor Dashwood	"have a notion , "" said"
Elinor Dashwood	"think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . "" In"

Elinor Dashwood	"ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"had you a great many smart beaux there ? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"my word , "" replied"
Elinor Dashwood	"can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"said Elinor . """
Elinor Dashwood	"cried he in the same eager tone , """
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	"replied Elinor , """
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	"Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne , whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby , as plainly denoted how well she understood him . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I want no proof of their affection , """
Elinor Dashwood	"but of their engagement I do . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I am perfectly satisfied of both . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly . Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? Have we not perfectly understood each other ? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ? My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ? How could such a thought occur to you ? How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister 's love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"I confess , """
Elinor Dashwood	"that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement ; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . """

Elinor Dashwood	"Thank you , ma'am , """

Elinor Dashwood	"said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , """
Elinor Dashwood	"And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent . When Mrs. Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared .

Elinor Dashwood	"said Elinor , """
Elinor Dashwood	""""
Elinor Dashwood	"The deception could not continue after this ; and an explanation immediately took place , by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment , without any material loss of happiness to either , for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another , and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first .

Elinor Dashwood	"he replied , """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority . """

Elinor Dashwood	""" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert ."

Elinor Dashwood	""" Of ONE thing , my dear sister ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her . The merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty.-- I remember her perfectly . Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward . I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier -- I think it is most probable -- that something might have been hit on . I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light . ' My dear fellow , ' I should have said , ' consider what you are doing . You are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving .

Elinor Dashwood	""" Hum""--said Mrs. Ferrars--""very pretty,""--and without regarding them at all , returned them to her daughter . Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough,--for , colouring a little , she immediately said ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""" She could say no more ; her spirits were quite overcome , and hiding her face on Elinor 's shoulder , she burst into tears .

Elinor Dashwood	""" 35 Elinor 's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of Edward and herself , had he been otherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars 's creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion . Or at least , if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward 's being fettered to Lucy , she determined , that had Lucy been more amiable , she OUGHT to have rejoiced . She wondered that Lucy 's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown . But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy 's eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was . The chance proved a lucky one , for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived , carried Mrs. Jennings away . """
Elinor Dashwood	"said she , """
Elinor Dashwood	"I guessed you would say so""--replied Lucy quickly--""but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing .

Elinor Dashwood	"That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your 's .

Elinor Dashwood	"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"I should always be happy , """

Elinor Dashwood	"What a pity it is , Elinor , """
Elinor Dashwood	"that Edward should have no taste for drawing . """
Elinor Dashwood	"No taste for drawing ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"why should you think so ? He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I hope , Marianne , """
Elinor Dashwood	"you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if THAT were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I am sure , """
Elinor Dashwood	"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Of his sense and his goodness , """
Elinor Dashwood	"no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now . When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I do not attempt to deny , """
Elinor Dashwood	"that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Esteem him ! Like him ! Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Excuse me , """
Elinor Dashwood	"and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank .

Edward Ferrars	"which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters .

Their man - servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication-- """

Edward Ferrars	"that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess . I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower -- and a troop of tidy , happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world . """

Edward Ferrars	"Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure.--What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! """
Edward Ferrars	"Certainly . """
Edward Ferrars	"I have long thought on this point , as you think now . It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do . But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing . I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since . "" """
Edward Ferrars	"consequence of which , I suppose , will be , "" said"
Edward Ferrars	"said he , """
Edward Ferrars	"The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods , was such -- so great -- as promised them all , the satisfaction of a sleepless night . Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both . Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears . Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil . But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably released from his former engagement , saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity;-- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart . Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor 's company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different . Between THEM no subject is finished , no communication is even made , till it has been made at least twenty times over . Lucy 's marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor 's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard . How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out . To her own heart it was a delightful affair , to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but to her reason , her judgment , it was completely a puzzle . Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest . Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother 's affairs might have done , if applied to in time . She repeated it to Edward . """
Edward Ferrars	"he presently added , """
Edward Ferrars	"How long it had been carrying on between them , however , he was equally at a loss with herself to make out ; for at Oxford , where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London , he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself , and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent , nor less affectionate than usual . Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance . He put the letter into Elinor 's hands . """
Edward Ferrars	"Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another 's . Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices . Your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain , """
Edward Ferrars	"LUCY FERRARS . """
Edward Ferrars	"Elinor read and returned it without any comment . """
Edward Ferrars	""""
Edward Ferrars	"In what state the affair stood at present between them , Edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him . He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy 's letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection . He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions-- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself . Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement , which , long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother 's anger , had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him . """
Edward Ferrars	"Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon 's being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford--""Which , at present , """
Edward Ferrars	"A letter of proper submission ! """
Edward Ferrars	"would they have me beg my mother 's pardon for Robert 's ingratitude to HER , and breach of honour to ME?--I can make no submission -- I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make . """
Edward Ferrars	"her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . """
Edward Ferrars	"Upon my soul , """
Edward Ferrars	"I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . ' My dear Madam , ' I always say to her , ' you must make yourself easy . The evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing . Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt 's , all this would have been prevented . ' This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error . """
Edward Ferrars	"said he , """
Edward Ferrars	"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake . I was last month at my friend Elliott 's , near Dartford . Lady Elliott wished to give a dance . ' But how can it be done ? ' said she ; ' my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed . There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ? ' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , ' My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy . The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card - tables may be placed in the drawing - room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon . ' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . We measured the dining - room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan . So that , in fact , you see , if people do but know how to set about it , every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling . """
Edward Ferrars	"They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street , and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations . """
Edward Ferrars	"My love I would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power . But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us . They are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and I think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by Edward . We can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more . I am sure you will like them ; indeed , you DO like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with Harry ! """
Edward Ferrars	"is exactly what I said , my dear . ' Lord ! ' says I , ' is Mrs. Dashwood ill ? ' So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this . Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;-- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . ' Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on . Poor soul ! I pity HER . And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan , and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar . The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . Lord ! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it ! To have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same . He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care . I have no pity for either of them . I have no notion of people 's making such a to - do about money and greatness . There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord ! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . "" Here"
Edward Ferrars	"without any resentment , "" I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours , madam . Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible . And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle 's care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary . In short , I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for , Mrs. Jennings . We all wish her extremely happy ; and Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct throughout the whole , has been such as every conscientious , good mother , in like circumstances , would adopt . It has been dignified and liberal . Edward has drawn his own lot , and I fear it will be"
Edward Ferrars	"not reward him . """
Edward Ferrars	"said Mrs. Jennings , "" and how"
Edward Ferrars	"it end ? "" "" I am sorry to say , ma'am , in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother 's notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can"

Edward Ferrars	"cried Mrs. Jennings , "" I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at"
Edward Ferrars	"form of it . "" If he would only have done as"
Edward Ferrars	"said John Dashwood , "" as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody 's power to assist him . And there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all -- his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately , which might have been Edward 's , on proper conditions . I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking"
Edward Ferrars	the business .

John Willoughby	"Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon 's injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate . Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her . Elinor , according to her expectation , saw on the two or three following days , that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done ; but while her resolution was unsubdued , and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy , her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health . Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future . Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward . She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode .

John Willoughby	"Marianne gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon Elinor , saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics . Mrs. Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant 's inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor 's countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne 's situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention . The servant , who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill , had sense enough to call one of the maids , who , with Mrs. Dashwood 's assistance , supported her into the other room . By that time , Marianne was rather better , and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence .

John Willoughby	"Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing , at this moment , """
John Willoughby	"though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship 's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother . The idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them . Willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked Marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of Colonel Brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . They contained a noble piece of water ; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning 's amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure . To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;-- and Mrs. Dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home . 13 Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected . She was prepared to be wet through , fatigued , and frightened ; but the event was still more unfortunate , for they did not go at all . By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park , where they were to breakfast . The morning was rather favourable , though it had rained all night , as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky , and the sun frequently appeared . They were all in high spirits and good humour , eager to be happy , and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise . While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in . Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room .

John Willoughby	"it out . "" "" Well , sir , and what"
John Willoughby	"Mrs. Smith ? "" "" She taxed me with the offence at once , and my confusion may be guessed . The purity of her life , the formality of her notions , her ignorance of the world -- every thing was against me . The matter itself I could not deny , and vain was every endeavour to soften it . She was previously disposed , I believe , to doubt the morality of my conduct in general , and was moreover discontented with the very little attention , the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her , in my present visit . In short , it ended in a total breach . By one measure I might have saved myself . In the height of her morality , good woman ! she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza . That could not be -- and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house . The night following this affair -- I was to go the next morning-- was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be . The struggle was great -- but it ended too soon . My affection for Marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me -- it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which I was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased . I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement . But whether I should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate . To see Marianne , I felt , would be dreadful , and I even doubted whether I could see her again , and keep to my resolution . In that point , however , I undervalued my own magnanimity , as the event declared ; for I went , I saw her , and saw her miserable , and left her miserable -- and left her hoping never to"

The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone . You were all gone I do not know where . I had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right ! A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and I remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as I walked from the cottage to Allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body ! But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . Her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately -- I never shall forget it -- united too with such reliance , such confidence in me!--Oh , God!--what a hard - hearted"

John Willoughby	"to hear . "" "" Marianne 's note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . '-- But this note made me know myself better . I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously . But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me . To retreat was impossible . All that I had to do , was to avoid you both . I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;--but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and"
John Willoughby	"my name . "" "" Watched us out"
John Willoughby	"the house ! "" "" Even so . You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you , how often I was on the point of falling in with you . I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by . Lodging as I did in Bond Street , there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long . I avoided the Middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings 's . He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him . The next morning brought another short note from Marianne-- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make MY conduct most hateful . I could not answer it . I tried -- but could not frame a sentence . But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day . If you CAN pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was THEN . With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse than all . Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!-- Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh , God!--holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- Well , it does not signify ; it is over now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne 's sweet face as white as death.--THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her;-- the last manner in which she appeared to me . It was a horrid sight!--yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world . She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same"
John Willoughby	"broke it thus : "" Well , let me make haste and be gone . Your sister is certainly better , certainly"
John Willoughby	"of danger ? "" "" We are"
John Willoughby	"of it . "" "" Your poor mother ,"
John Willoughby	"on Marianne . "" "" But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to"
John Willoughby	"about that ? "" "" Yes , yes , THAT in particular . Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . You saw what she said . I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings . It happened to catch Sophia 's eye before it caught mine -- and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand - writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion . Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever . Affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents . She was well paid for her impudence . She read what made her wretched . Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion -- her malice -- At all events it must be appeased . And , in short -- what do you think of my wife 's style of letter - writing?--delicate -- tender-- truly feminine --"
John Willoughby	"it not ? "" "" Your wife!--The letter was in your own"
John Willoughby	"- writing . "" "" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to . The original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . But what could I do!--we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed -- But I am talking like a fool . Preparation!--day!--In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture . And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end . My business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.-- ' I am ruined for ever in their opinion-- ' said I to myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one . ' Such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , I copied my wife 's words , and parted with the last relics of Marianne . Her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever -- I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them . And the lock of hair -- that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket - book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock -- all , every memento was"
John Willoughby	"her illness . "" "" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy . What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments -- for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ? ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made , and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage . Now"
John Willoughby	"it with affection . "" And you DO think something better of me than you did?"" --said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel - piece as if forgetting he was to go . Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave , pitied , wished him well -- was even interested in his happiness -- and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it . His answer"
John Willoughby	""" As to that"
John Willoughby	"blessed chance at liberty again-- "" Elinor stopped"
John Willoughby	dread
John Willoughby	What
John Willoughby	Your
John Willoughby	"Good bye,--God bless you ! "" And with these words , he almost ran out of the room . 45 Elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister . Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits . She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge . But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less . When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes . Elinor 's heart was full . The past , the present , the future , Willoughby 's visit , Marianne 's safety , and her mother 's expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby 's leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment 's horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it . Mrs. Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne 's being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but SHE , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief;-- and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears . She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . Elinor 's delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;-- but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , in compliance with her mother 's entreaty , went to bed . But the rest , which one night entirely sleepless , and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite , was kept off by irritation of"
John Willoughby	""" poor Willoughby , "" as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful . She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby 's death . The shock of Colonel Brandon 's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection . Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood 's looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward . But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor . It was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference"

John Willoughby	"then hastily took leave of them all and left the room . They saw him step into his carriage , and in a minute it was out of sight . Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech , and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned . Elinor 's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother 's . She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust . Willoughby 's behaviour in taking leave of them , his embarrassment , and affectation of cheerfulness , and , above all , his unwillingness to accept her mother 's invitation , a backwardness so unlike a lover , so unlike himself , greatly disturbed her . One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what Marianne 's love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible . But whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister 's affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty . In about half an hour her mother returned , and though her eyes were red , her countenance was not uncheerful . "" Our"

John Willoughby	"No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure . """
John Willoughby	"But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . """
John Willoughby	"You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain . I have had my doubts , I confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away . If we find they correspond , every fear of mine will be removed . """
John Willoughby	"A mighty concession indeed ! If you were to see them at the altar , you would suppose they were going to be married . Ungracious girl ! But I require no such proof . Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved . You can not doubt your sister 's wishes .

Thomas Palmer	"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ? """
Thomas Palmer	"Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married.-- He was a particular friend of Sir John 's . I believe , """
Thomas Palmer	"he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could . Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much . But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . """
Thomas Palmer	"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John 's proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ? """
Thomas Palmer	"Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things . He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school . However , I am much happier as I am . Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . """

Mrs. Dashwood , who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage , absolutely refused on her own account ; her daughters might do as they pleased . But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner , and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way . They attempted , therefore , likewise , to excuse themselves ; the weather was uncertain , and not likely to be good . But Sir John would not be satisfied -- the carriage should be sent for them and they must come . Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them . Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties , all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party ; and the young ladies were obliged to yield . "" Why"

Lady Middleton	"The remaining five were now to draw their cards . """
Lady Middleton	"As for the house itself , to be sure , """
Lady Middleton	"it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building . These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . I could wish the stairs were handsome . But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . """
Lady Middleton	"It is very shocking , indeed ! """
Lady Middleton	"said Mrs. Dashwood , when he was leaving them . """
Lady Middleton	"He engaged to be with them by four o'clock . 15 Mrs. Dashwood 's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home . On their return from the park they found Willoughby 's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just . So far it was all as she had foreseen ; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect . They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction , with her handkerchief at her eyes ; and without noticing them ran up stairs . Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them . He turned round on their coming in , and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over - powered Marianne . "" Is"

Lucy Steele	"She looked down as she said this , amiably bashful , with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her . """
Lucy Steele	"cried Elinor , """
Lucy Steele	"And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister - in - law . """
Lucy Steele	"What felt Elinor at that moment ? Astonishment , that would have been as painful as it was strong , had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it . She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement , unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration ; and though her complexion varied , she stood firm in incredulity , and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit , or a swoon .

Lucy Steele	"continued Lucy ; """
Lucy Steele	""" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ?"
Lucy Steele	""" We have been engaged these four years ."
Lucy Steele	""" Four years !"
Lucy Steele	""" Yes ."

Lucy Steele	""" Your uncle !"
Lucy Steele	""" He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him ."

Lucy Steele	""" said she with a firm voice ."
Lucy Steele	""" She put it into her hands as she spoke ; and when Elinor saw the painting , whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision , or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind , she could have none of its being Edward 's face .

Lucy Steele	""" Elinor saw that it WAS his hand , and she could doubt no longer . This picture , she had allowed herself to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been Edward 's gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for the time complete ."
Lucy Steele	""" said Lucy , returning the letter into her pocket ,"
Lucy Steele	""""
Lucy Steele	""" said Elinor , with a composure of voice , under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before . She was mortified , shocked , confounded . Fortunately for her , they had now reached the cottage , and the conversation could be continued no farther . After sitting with them a few minutes , the Miss Steeles returned to the Park , and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched . [ At this point in the first and second editions , Volume 1 ends . ] 23 However small Elinor 's general dependence on Lucy 's veracity might be , it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case , where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description . What Lucy had asserted to be true , therefore , Elinor could not , dared not longer doubt ; supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs , and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes . Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest , at once indisputable and alarming ; and Edward 's visit near Plymouth , his melancholy state of mind , his dissatisfaction at his own prospects , his uncertain behaviour towards herself , the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections , which had often surprised her , the picture , the letter , the ring , formed altogether such a body of evidence , as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly , and established as a fact , which no partiality could set aside , his ill - treatment of herself.--Her resentment of such behaviour , her indignation at having been its dupe , for a short time made her feel only for herself ; but other ideas , other considerations , soon arose . Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her ? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel ? Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart ? No ; whatever it might once have been , she could not believe it such at present . His affection was all her own . She could not be deceived in that . Her mother , sisters , Fanny , all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland ; it was not an illusion of her own vanity . He certainly loved her . What a softener of the heart was this persuasion ! How much could it not tempt her to forgive ! He had been blamable , highly blamable , in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be . In that , he could not be defended ; but if he had injured her , how much more had he injured himself ; if her case were pitiable , his was hopeless . His imprudence had made her miserable for a while ; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise . She might in time regain tranquillity ; but HE , what had he to look forward to ? Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele ; could he , were his affection for herself out of the question , with his integrity , his delicacy , and well - informed mind , be satisfied with a wife like her -- illiterate , artful , and selfish ? The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature ; but the four succeeding years -- years , which if rationally spent , give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education , while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits , had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty . If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself . These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief ! As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself . Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters . And so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house . The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor 's distress . On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support . From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise . She was stronger alone , and her own good sense so well supported her , that her firmness was as unshaken , her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable , as with regrets so poignant and so fresh , it was possible for them to be . Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject , she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one . She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful . That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy 's assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important . And even Sir John 's joking intelligence must have had some weight . But indeed , while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous ; and that she was so , her very confidence was a proof . What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be , but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy 's superior claims on Edward , and be taught to avoid him in future ? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival 's intentions , and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed , to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible ; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded . And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told , she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure . But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded , though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred ; for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk , where they might most easily separate themselves from the others ; and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage , and chiefly at the former , they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation . Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton 's head ; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat , and none at all for particular discourse . They met for the sake of eating , drinking , and laughing together , playing at cards , or consequences , or any other game that was sufficiently noisy . One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise . The young ladies went , and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her . The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected ; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression , and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room : to the latter , the children accompanied them , and while they remained there , she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy 's attention to attempt it . They quitted it only with the removal of the tea - things . The card - table was then placed , and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park . They all rose up in preparation for a round game . """

Lucy Steele	"Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child .

Lucy Steele	"nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again . And I must say that Lucy 's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all . Poor Mr. Edward ! I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him . """

Lucy Steele	"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . """
Lucy Steele	"Thank you , """

Lucy Steele	"Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me , """
Lucy Steele	"And yet I do assure you , """
Lucy Steele	"there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . """
Lucy Steele	"Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr. Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . """
Lucy Steele	"He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward 's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . """
Lucy Steele	"Edward 's love for me , """
Lucy Steele	"has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment 's alarm on that account from the first . """
Lucy Steele	"I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . """
Lucy Steele	"If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward 's sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . """
Lucy Steele	"And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason . """
Lucy Steele	"Not at all -- I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother -- silly and a great coxcomb . """
Lucy Steele	"No sister , """
Lucy Steele	"you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs . """
Lucy Steele	"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . """
Lucy Steele	"Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . """
Lucy Steele	"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ? """
Lucy Steele	"Indeed you wrong me , """
Lucy Steele	"I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately . """
Lucy Steele	"' Tis because you are an indifferent person , """
Lucy Steele	"that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . """
Lucy Steele	"Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? """
Lucy Steele	"Certainly not . """
Lucy Steele	"I am sorry for that , """
Lucy Steele	"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! But I dare say you will go for all that . To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them . """
Lucy Steele	"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . """
Lucy Steele	"How unlucky that is ! I had quite depended upon meeting you there . Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . """
Lucy Steele	"will have you BOTH go , "" said"
Lucy Steele	"objections are nonsensical .

Mrs. Dashwood	"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ? From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her . She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . """

Mrs. Dashwood	"I can hardly tell myself . But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him .

Mrs. Dashwood	"Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary . But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?--I am happy -- and he is acquitted . """
Mrs. Dashwood	"Not entirely . It may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they ARE engaged ) from Mrs. Smith-- and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present . But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us . """

Colonel Brandon	"When Sir John returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country . The carriages were then ordered ; Willoughby 's was first , and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it . He drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . They both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs . It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long . Some more of the Careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which Sir John observed with great contentment . Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods . Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor 's right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and Willoughby , and said to Marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , """
Colonel Brandon	""" Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ?"

Colonel Brandon	"A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . """
Colonel Brandon	"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , """
Colonel Brandon	"and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing . My object -- my wish -- my sole wish in desiring it -- I hope , I believe it is -- is to be a means of giving comfort;--no , I must not say comfort -- not present comfort -- but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister 's mind . My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- I think I am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ? """
Colonel Brandon	"It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England . My first care , when I DID arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her . Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . So altered -- so faded -- worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her -- but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it -- I have pained you too much already . That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . """
Colonel Brandon	"Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , """
Colonel Brandon	"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation . Their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be . But to what does all this lead ? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing . Ah ! Miss Dashwood -- a subject such as this -- untouched for fourteen years -- it is dangerous to handle it at all ! I WILL be more collected -- more concise . She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old . She loved the child , and had always kept it with her . It was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but I had no family , no home ; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school . I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at Delaford . I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her . It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation . But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared . I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all . He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter 's being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture . What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too .

Colonel Brandon	Brandon 's character ,
Colonel Brandon	"I could see it in his face . Poor man ! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad . The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved . I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ? I wonder whether it is so . I would give anything to know the truth of it . Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her . May be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for I have a notion she is always rather sickly . I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams . It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time . I wonder what it can be ! May be his sister is worse at Avignon , and has sent for him over . His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it . Well , I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain . """

Colonel Brandon	"Yes . I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can -- it will not satisfy YOU , I know ; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it . I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this . And now , Elinor , what have you to say ? """
Colonel Brandon	"Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer . """
Colonel Brandon	"Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened . Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings ! You had rather take evil upon credit than good . You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter . You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves , though unavoidably secret for a while ? And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? """
Colonel Brandon	"Well , Miss Dashwood , """
Colonel Brandon	"I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I TRIED to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business . And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart . """
Colonel Brandon	"What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it can not be expected that any one else should say for him . He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected , such unthought - of information could not fail of exciting ; but he said only these two words , """

Colonel Brandon	""""
Colonel Brandon	""""
Colonel Brandon	""""
Colonel Brandon	""" Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars . After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart . They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves , before he began to speak of Edward ; for he , too , had heard of the living , and was very inquisitive on the subject . Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on HIM . He laughed most immoderately . The idea of Edward 's being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage - house , diverted him beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous . Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of her 's , but by his own sensibility ."
Colonel Brandon	""" These are done by my eldest sister ,"
Colonel Brandon	""" and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well ."

Robert Ferrars	"fixing her eyes upon Elinor , """
Robert Ferrars	""""
Robert Ferrars	""" cried Lucy , smiling ."
John Dashwood	"It was my father 's last request to me , """
John Dashwood	"that I should assist his widow and daughters . """
John Dashwood	"Why , to be sure , """
John Dashwood	"that would make great difference . The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . """
John Dashwood	"It is certainly an unpleasant thing , """
John Dashwood	"to have those kind of yearly drains on one 's income . One 's fortune , as your mother justly says , is NOT one 's own . To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one 's independence . """
John Dashwood	"Undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . They think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . If I were you , whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely . I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . """
John Dashwood	"Upon my word , """
John Dashwood	"I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can . Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . """
John Dashwood	"Perhaps you mean -- my brother -- you mean Mrs.--Mrs . ROBERT Ferrars . """
John Dashwood	"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!"" --was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak , even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder . He rose from his seat , and walked to the window , apparently from not knowing what to do ; took up a pair of scissors that lay there , and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke , said , in a hurried voice ,"
John Dashwood	"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward 's name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion . Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children . """
John Dashwood	""" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair ."
John Dashwood	""" said he , at last , recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--""but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business . Poor Edward ! he is ruined for ever . I am extremely sorry for it-- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!-- to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . I could not believe it.-- My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again . ' That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . My poor mother was half frantic ."
John Dashwood	""" Have you ever seen the lady ?"
John Dashwood	"I will not say that I am disappointed , my dear sister , """
John Dashwood	"THAT would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is . But , I confess , it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother . His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him-- yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen -- for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else -- and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth;-- in short , you may as well give her a chance -- You understand me . "" -- But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them , and always treated them with the make - believe of decent affection , they were never insulted by her real favour and preference . THAT was due to the folly of Robert , and the cunning of his wife ; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away . The selfish sagacity of the latter , which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape , was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it ; for her respectful humility , assiduous attentions , and endless flatteries , as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise , reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice , and re - established him completely in her favour . The whole of Lucy 's behaviour in the affair , and the prosperity which crowned it , therefore , may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest , an unceasing attention to self - interest , however its progress may be apparently obstructed , will do in securing every advantage of fortune , with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience . When Robert first sought her acquaintance , and privately visited her in Bartlett 's Buildings , it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother . He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement ; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both , he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter . In that point , however , and that only , he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME , another visit , another conversation , was always wanted to produce this conviction . Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted , which could only be removed by another half hour 's discourse with himself . His attendance was by this means secured , and the rest followed in course . Instead of talking of Edward , they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother . He was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking Edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother 's consent . What immediately followed is known . They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish ; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut -- and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;-- and from thence returning to town , procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars , by the simple expedient of asking it , which , at Lucy 's instigation , was adopted . The forgiveness , at first , indeed , as was reasonable , comprehended only Robert ; and Lucy , who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none , still remained some weeks longer unpardoned . But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages , in self - condemnation for Robert 's offence , and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child . They settled in town , received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars , were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods ; and setting aside the jealousies and ill - will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy , in which their husbands of course took a part , as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves , nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together . What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son , might have puzzled many people to find out ; and what Robert had done to succeed to it , might have puzzled them still more . It was an arrangement , however , justified in its effects , if not in its cause ; for nothing ever appeared in Robert 's style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income , as either leaving his brother too little , or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular , from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home , and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits , he might be supposed no less contented with his lot , no less free from every wish of an exchange . Elinor 's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived , without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless , for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her . Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed . It was now her darling object . Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor . They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all . With such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do ? Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate . She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions , and to counteract , by her conduct , her most favourite maxims . She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen , and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship , voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other , a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment , whom , two years before , she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat ! But so it was . Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion , as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining even for ever with her mother , and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study , as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,-- she found herself at nineteen , submitting to new attachments , entering on new duties , placed in a new home , a wife , the mistress of a family , and the patroness of a village . Colonel Brandon was now as happy , as all those who best loved him , believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation , and his spirits to cheerfulness ; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his , was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend . Marianne could never love by halves ; and her whole heart became , in time , as much devoted to her husband , as it had once been to Willoughby . Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang ; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith , who , by stating his marriage with a woman of character , as the source of her clemency , gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne , he might at once have been happy and rich . That his repentance of misconduct , which thus brought its own punishment , was sincere , need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy , and of Marianne with regret . But that he was for ever inconsolable , that he fled from society , or contracted an habitual gloom of temper , or died of a broken heart , must not be depended on -- for he did neither . He lived to exert , and frequently to enjoy himself . His wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity . For Marianne , however -- in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss -- he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;-- and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after - days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon . Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover . Between Barton and Delaford , there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne , let it not be ranked as the least considerable , that though sisters , and living almost within sight of each other , they could live without disagreement between themselves , or producing coolness between their husbands . THE END"
Mrs. Ferrars	"I know it -- I know it , """
Mrs. Ferrars	"I wish for no change . """
Mrs. Ferrars	"said Mrs. Dashwood ; """
Mrs. Ferrars	"Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister 's spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , """

Mrs. Ferrars	Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed . Marianne had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more . Mrs. Dashwood 's and Elinor 's appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before . When the dessert and the wine were arranged , and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves , they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence . Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation . She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor 's representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne . She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;-- that Marianne 's affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude .

Mrs. Ferrars	""""
Mrs. Ferrars	""" Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door 's being thrown open , the servant 's announcing Mr. Ferrars , and Edward 's immediately walking in . It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so . They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it . The very circumstance , in its unpleasantest form , which they would each have been most anxious to avoid , had fallen on them.--They were not only all three together , but were together without the relief of any other person . The ladies recovered themselves first . It was not Lucy 's business to put herself forward , and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up . She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness , and after slightly addressing him , said no more . But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment 's recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them . She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street . She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her . Her manners gave some re - assurance to Edward , and he had courage enough to sit down ; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion , which the case rendered reasonable , though his sex might make it rare ; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy 's , nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor 's . Lucy , with a demure and settled air , seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others , and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that WAS said , proceeded from Elinor , who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother 's health , their coming to town , & c. which Edward ought to have inquired about , but never did . Her exertions did not stop here ; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine , under pretence of fetching Marianne , to leave the others by themselves ; and she really did it , and THAT in the handsomest manner , for she loitered away several minutes on the landing - place , with the most high - minded fortitude , before she went to her sister . When that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease ; for Marianne 's joy hurried her into the drawing - room immediately . Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings , strong in itself , and strongly spoken . She met him with a hand that would be taken , and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister ."
Mrs. Ferrars	"like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . "" Mrs."
