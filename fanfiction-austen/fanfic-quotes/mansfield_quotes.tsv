Fanny Price	must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring . He is made . Your brother is a lieutenant . I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother ’s promotion . Here are the letters which announce it , this moment come to hand . You will , perhaps , like to see them . ” Fanny
Fanny Price	will go to my uncle . My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible . ” But
Fanny Price	must not go , she must allow him five minutes longer , ” and
Fanny Price	n’t , Mr. Crawford , pray do n’t ! I beg you would not . This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me . I must go away . I can not bear it . ” But
Fanny Price	, no , no ! ” she
Fanny Price	is all nonsense . Do not distress me . I can hear no more of this . Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express ; but I do not want , I can not bear , I must not listen to such — No , no , do n’t think of me . But you are _ not _ thinking of me . I know it is all nothing . ” She
Fanny Price	DEAR FANNY,—for so I may now always call you , to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _ Miss _ _ Price _ for at least the last six weeks — I can not let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation , and giving my most joyful consent and approval . Go on , my dear Fanny , and without fear ; there can be no difficulties worth naming . I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something ; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles this afternoon , and send him back to me even happier than he goes . Yours affectionately , M. C. ” These
Fanny Price	Now _ William would be able to keep himself , which would make a vast difference to his uncle , for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle ; and , indeed , it would make some difference in _ her _ presents too . She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting , very glad , indeed , that it had been in her power , without material inconvenience , just at that time to give him something rather considerable ; that is , for _ her _ , with _ her _ limited means , for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin . She knew he must be at some expense , that he would have many things to buy , though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap ; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it . ” “
Fanny Price	am glad you gave him something considerable , ” said
Fanny Price	_ I _ gave him only £ 10 . ” “
Fanny Price	! ” cried
Fanny Price	my word , he must have gone off with his pockets well lined , and at no expense for his journey to London either ! ” “
Fanny Price	Thomas told me £ 10 would be enough . ” Mrs.
Fanny Price	is amazing , ” said
Fanny Price	much young people cost their friends , what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world ! They little think how much it comes to , or what their parents , or their uncles and aunts , pay for them in the course of the year . Now , here are my sister Price ’s children ; take them all together , I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year , to say nothing of what _ I _ do for them . ” “
Fanny Price	true , sister , as you say . But , poor things ! they can not help it ; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas . Fanny , William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies ; and I shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having . I wish he may go to the East Indies , that I may have my shawl . I think I will have two shawls , Fanny . ” Fanny
Fanny Price	you nothing to send to Mary ? No answer to her note ? She will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you . Pray write to her , if it be only a line . ” “
Fanny Price	yes ! certainly , ” cried
Fanny Price	am very much obliged to you , my dear Miss Crawford , for your kind congratulations , as far as they relate to my dearest William . The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice . I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently . I do not know what I write , but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again . With thanks for the honour of your note , I remain , dear Miss Crawford , & c. , & c. ” The
Fanny Price	can not think I mean to hurry you , ” said
Fanny Price	can not think I have any such object . Do not hurry yourself , I entreat . ” “
Fanny Price	! I thank you ; I have quite done , just done ; it will be ready in a moment ; I am very much obliged to you ; if you will be so good as to give _ that _ to Miss Crawford . ” The
Fanny Price	My Dear Fanny,—Excuse me that I have not written before . Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me , but I found it impossible to write from London , and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence . Could I have sent a few happy lines , they should not have been wanting , but nothing of that nature was ever in my power . I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it . My hopes are much weaker . You are probably aware of this already . So very fond of you as Miss Crawford is , it is most natural that she should tell you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine . I will not be prevented , however , from making my own communication . Our confidences in you need not clash . I ask no questions . There is something soothing in the idea that we have the same friend , and that whatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us , we are united in our love of you . It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are , and what are my present plans , if plans I can be said to have . I have been returned since Saturday . I was three weeks in London , and saw her ( for London ) very often . I had every attention from the Frasers that could be reasonably expected . I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield . It was her manner , however , rather than any unfrequency of meeting . Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered : my first reception was so unlike what I had hoped , that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly . I need not particularise . You know the weak side of her character , and may imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me . She was in high spirits , and surrounded by those who were giving all the support of their own bad sense to her too lively mind . I do not like Mrs. Fraser . She is a cold - hearted , vain woman , who has married entirely from convenience , and though evidently unhappy in her marriage , places her disappointment not to faults of judgment , or temper , or disproportion of age , but to her being , after all , less affluent than many of her acquaintance , especially than her sister , Lady Stornaway , and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious , provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough . I look upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine . They have been leading her astray for years . Could she be detached from them!—and sometimes I do not despair of it , for the affection appears to me principally on their side . They are very fond of her ; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you . When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . I can not give her up , Fanny . She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife . If I did not believe that she had some regard for me , of course I should not say this , but I do believe it . I am convinced that she is not without a decided preference . I have no jealousy of any individual . It is the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of . It is the habits of wealth that I fear . Her ideas are not higher than her own fortune may warrant , but they are beyond what our incomes united could authorise . There is comfort , however , even here . I could better bear to lose her because not rich enough , than because of my profession . That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices , which , in fact , I am scarcely justified in asking ; and , if I am refused , that , I think , will be the honest motive . Her prejudices , I trust , are not so strong as they were . You have my thoughts exactly as they arise , my dear Fanny ; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory , but it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind . Having once begun , it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel . I can not give her up . Connected as we already are , and , I hope , are to be , to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom , under any other distress , I should turn to for consolation . The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny . Were it a decided thing , an actual refusal , I hope I should know how to bear it , and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart , and in the course of a few years — but I am writing nonsense . Were I refused , I must bear it ; and till I am , I can never cease to try for her . This is the truth . The only question is _ how _ ? What may be the likeliest means ? I have sometimes thought of going to London again after Easter , and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield . Even now , she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June ; but June is at a great distance , and I believe I shall write to her . I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter . To be at an early certainty is a material object . My present state is miserably irksome . Considering everything , I think a letter will be decidedly the best method of explanation . I shall be able to write much that I could not say , and shall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer , and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse ; I think I am . My greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser , and I at a distance unable to help my own cause . A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation , and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision , an adviser may , in an unlucky moment , lead it to do what it may afterwards regret . I must think this matter over a little . This long letter , full of my own concerns alone , will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny . The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser ’s party . I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him . There is not a shadow of wavering . He thoroughly knows his own mind , and acts up to his resolutions : an inestimable quality . I could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me , and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends . There was marked coolness on her side . They scarcely spoke . I saw him draw back surprised , and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram . You will wish to hear my opinion of Maria ’s degree of comfort as a wife . There is no appearance of unhappiness . I hope they get on pretty well together . I dined twice in Wimpole Street , and might have been there oftener , but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother . Julia seems to enjoy London exceedingly . I had little enjoyment there , but have less here . We are not a lively party . You are very much wanted . I miss you more than I can express . My mother desires her best love , and hopes to hear from you soon . She talks of you almost every hour , and I am sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you . My father means to fetch you himself , but it will not be till after Easter , when he has business in town . You are happy at Portsmouth , I hope , but this must not be a yearly visit . I want you at home , that I may have your opinion about Thornton Lacey . I have little heart for extensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress . I think I shall certainly write . It is quite settled that the Grants go to Bath ; they leave Mansfield on Monday . I am glad of it . I am not comfortable enough to be fit for anybody ; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.—Yours ever , my dearest Fanny . ”
Fanny Price	I never will , no , I certainly never will wish for a letter again , ”
Fanny Price	What do they bring but disappointment and sorrow ? Not till after Easter ! How shall I bear it ? And my poor aunt talking of me every hour ! ”
Fanny Price	There is no good in this delay , ”
Fanny Price	Why is not it settled ? He is blinded , and nothing will open his eyes ; nothing can , after having had truths before him so long in vain . He will marry her , and be poor and miserable . God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be respectable ! ”
Fanny Price	‘ So very fond of me ! ’ ’ tis nonsense all . She loves nobody but herself and her brother . Her friends leading her astray for years ! She is quite as likely to have led _ them _ astray . They have all , perhaps , been corrupting one another ; but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them , she is the less likely to have been hurt , except by their flattery . ‘ The only woman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife . ’ I firmly believe it . It is an attachment to govern his whole life . Accepted or refused , his heart is wedded to her for ever . ‘ The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny . ’ Edmund , you do not know me . The families would never be connected if you did not connect them ! Oh ! write , write . Finish it at once . Let there be an end of this suspense . Fix , commit , condemn yourself . ”
Fanny Price	This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ”
Fanny Price	has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me . We shall greatly miss Edmund in our small circle , but I trust and hope he will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended , and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly , which Sir Thomas proposes should be done , and thinks best on every account , and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury . As I have little doubt of your feeling for us , my dear Fanny , under these distressing circumstances , I will write again very soon . ”
Fanny Price	the subject of my last , I had actually begun a letter when called away by Tom ’s illness , but I have now changed my mind , and fear to trust the influence of friends . When Tom is better , I shall go . ” Such
Fanny Price	what intense desire she wants her home , ” was
Fanny Price	I go back into Northamptonshire , or when I return to Mansfield , I shall do so and so . ” For
Fanny Price	had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in , but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it . Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended ; he saw her this morning : she returns to Wimpole Street to - day ; the old lady is come . Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond . He does it every spring . Be assured he cares for nobody but you . At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours . In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul . Dear Fanny , write directly , and tell us to come . It will do us all good . He and I can go to the Parsonage , you know , and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park . It would really be gratifying to see them all again , and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to them ; and as to yourself , you must feel yourself to be so wanted there , that you can not in conscience — conscientious as you are — keep away , when you have the means of returning . I have not time or patience to give half Henry ’s messages ; be satisfied that the spirit of each and every one is unalterable affection . ” Fanny
Fanny Price	I am rather surprised , ”
Fanny Price	that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon , after being here so long before , full seven weeks ; for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about , that I thought something would certainly occur , when he was once gone , to take him elsewhere . He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield . ”
Fanny Price	If Miss Bertram were not engaged , ”
Fanny Price	I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia . ”
Fanny Price	My dear Tom , ”
Fanny Price	as you are not dancing , I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber ; shall you ? ”
Fanny Price	We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth , you know . Your mother is quite anxious about it , but can not very well spare time to sit down herself , because of her fringe . Now , you and I and Dr. Grant will just do ; and though _ we _ play but half - crowns , you know , you may bet half - guineas with _ him _ . ”
Fanny Price	do not be dawdling any longer , or the dance will be over . ”
Fanny Price	A pretty modest request upon my word , ”
Fanny Price	To want to nail me to a card - table for the next two hours with herself and Dr. Grant , who are always quarrelling , and that poking old woman , who knows no more of whist than of algebra . I wish my good aunt would be a little less busy ! And to ask me in such a way too ! without ceremony , before them all , so as to leave me no possibility of refusing . _ That _ is what I dislike most particularly . It raises my spleen more than anything , to have the pretence of being asked , of being given a choice , and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing , whatever it be ! If I had not luckily thought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it . It is a great deal too bad . But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head , nothing can stop her . ”
Fanny Price	trifling part , ” said
Fanny Price	not at all to my taste , and such a one as I certainly would not accept again ; but I was determined to make no difficulties . Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford ; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me , it was impossible to take it , you know . I was sorry for _ him _ that he should have so mistaken his powers , for he was no more equal to the Baron — a little man with a weak voice , always hoarse after the first ten minutes . It must have injured the piece materially ; but _ I _ was resolved to make no difficulties . Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick , but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself ; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two . I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick . Luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him . Our Agatha was inimitable , and the duke was thought very great by many . And upon the whole , it would certainly have gone off wonderfully . ” “
Fanny Price	they may not be able to find any play to suit them . Your brother ’s taste and your sisters ’ seem very different . ” “
Fanny Price	have no hope there , Fanny . If they persist in the scheme , they will find something . I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _ them _ , and that is all I can do . ” “
Fanny Price	I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere ”
Fanny Price	Sad , sad girl ! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you , ”
Fanny Price	Ha ! ”
Fanny Price	am I here again ? The East room ! Once only was I in this room before ”
Fanny Price	Once only before . Do you remember it ? I came to rehearse . Your cousin came too ; and we had a rehearsal . You were our audience and prompter . A delightful rehearsal . I shall never forget it . Here we were , just in this part of the room : here was your cousin , here was I , here were the chairs . Oh ! why will such things ever pass away ? ”
Fanny Price	The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable ! The subject of it so very — very — what shall I say ? He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me . I think I see him now , trying to be as demure and composed as Anhalt ought , through the two long speeches . ‘ When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state , matrimony may be called a happy life . ’ I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words . It was curious , very curious , that we should have such a scene to play ! If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence , it should be that week — that acting week . Say what you would , Fanny , it should be _ that _ ; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other . His sturdy spirit to bend as it did ! Oh ! it was sweet beyond expression . But alas , that very evening destroyed it all . That very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle . Poor Sir Thomas , who was glad to see you ? Yet , Fanny , do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas , though I certainly did hate him for many a week . No , I do him justice now . He is just what the head of such a family should be . Nay , in sober sadness , I believe I now love you all . ”
Fanny Price	I have had a little fit since I came into this room , as you may perceive , ”
Fanny Price	but it is over now ; so let us sit down and be comfortable ; for as to scolding you , Fanny , which I came fully intending to do , I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point . ”
Fanny Price	Good , gentle Fanny ! when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long , I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you . ”
Fanny Price	last . ”
Fanny Price	I hate to leave you . I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going . Who says we shall not be sisters ? I know we shall . I feel that we are born to be connected ; and those tears convince me that you feel it too , dear Fanny . ”
Fanny Price	But you are only going from one set of friends to another . You are going to a very particular friend . ”
Fanny Price	Yes , very true . Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years . But I have not the least inclination to go near her . I can think only of the friends I am leaving : my excellent sister , yourself , and the Bertrams in general . You have all so much more _ heart _ among you than one finds in the world at large . You all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you , which in common intercourse one knows nothing of . I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter , a much better time for the visit , but now I can not put her off . And when I have done with her I must go to her sister , Lady Stornaway , because _ she _ was rather my most particular friend of the two , but I have not cared much for _ her _ these three years . ”
Fanny Price	How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs , and setting off to find my way to the East room , without having an idea whereabouts it was ! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along , and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work ; and then your cousin ’s astonishment , when he opened the door , at seeing me here ! To be sure , your uncle ’s returning that very evening ! There never was anything quite like it . ”
Fanny Price	Why , Fanny , you are absolutely in a reverie . Thinking , I hope , of one who is always thinking of you . Oh ! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town , that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there ! Oh ! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens ; the wonder , the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done ! For as to secrecy , Henry is quite the hero of an old romance , and glories in his chains . You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest . If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . Oh ! she has been trying for him to such a degree . Innocent and quiet as you sit here , you can not have an idea of the _ sensation _ that you will be occasioning , of the curiosity there will be to see you , of the endless questions I shall have to answer ! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth , and how you do your hair , and who makes your shoes . I wish Margaret were married , for my poor friend ’s sake , for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people . And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time . We were all delighted . She could not do otherwise than accept him , for he was rich , and she had nothing ; but he turns out ill - tempered and _ exigeant _ , and wants a young woman , a beautiful young woman of five - and - twenty , to be as steady as himself . And my friend does not manage him well ; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it . There is a spirit of irritation which , to say nothing worse , is certainly very ill - bred . In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect . Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister , and a certain consideration for her judgment , which makes one feel there _ is _ attachment ; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers . I shall be at Mansfield for ever , Fanny . My own sister as a wife , Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband , are my standards of perfection . Poor Janet has been sadly taken in , and yet there was nothing improper on her side : she did not run into the match inconsiderately ; there was no want of foresight . She took three days to consider of his proposals , and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having , and especially applied to my late dear aunt , whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance , and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser . This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort . I have not so much to say for my friend Flora , who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway , who has about as much sense , Fanny , as Mr. Rushworth , but much worse - looking , and with a blackguard character . I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong . By the bye , Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out . But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference . But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? No , no , I see you are not . ”
Fanny Price	Excellent creature ! I will not tease you . Everything shall take its course . But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies . It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject , some surmises as to what might be . You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power . Was not he devoted to you at the ball ? And then before the ball , the necklace ! Oh ! you received it just as it was meant . You were as conscious as heart could desire . I remember it perfectly . ”
Fanny Price	Do you mean , then , that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand ? Oh ! Miss Crawford , _ that _ was not fair . ”
Fanny Price	Knew of it ! It was his own doing entirely , his own thought . I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . ”
Fanny Price	I will not say , ”
Fanny Price	that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first — indeed , indeed I was . It is as true as that I sit here . And had I had an idea of it , nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace . As to your brother ’s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me . I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn . I was quiet , but I was not blind . I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . ”
Fanny Price	Ah ! I can not deny it . He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies ’ affections . I have often scolded him for it , but it is his only fault ; and there is this to be said , that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for . And then , Fanny , the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many ; of having it in one ’s power to pay off the debts of one ’s sex ! Oh ! I am sure it is not in woman ’s nature to refuse such a triumph . ”
Fanny Price	I can not think well of a man who sports with any woman ’s feelings ; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander - by can judge of . ”
Fanny Price	I do not defend him . I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife ’s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to . And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . If any man ever loved a woman for ever , I think Henry will do as much for you . ”
Fanny Price	I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move . The Admiral hates trouble , and scorns asking favours ; and there are so many young men ’s claims to be attended to in the same way , that a friendship and energy , not very determined , is easily put by . What a happy creature William must be ! I wish we could see him . ”
Fanny Price	I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here . And I do take leave , longing for a happy reunion , and trusting that when we meet again , it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve . ”
Fanny Price	I shall see your cousin in town soon : he talks of being there tolerably soon ; and Sir Thomas , I dare say , in the course of the spring ; and your eldest cousin , and the Rushworths , and Julia , I am sure of meeting again and again , and all but you . I have two favours to ask , Fanny : one is your correspondence . You must write to me . And the other , that you will often call on Mrs. Grant , and make her amends for my being gone . ”
Fanny Price	may be , sister , ” was
Fanny Price	dare say you are very right ; but I am sure I shall miss her very much . ” The
Fanny Price	_ I _ shall write to you , Fanny , when I have anything worth writing about , anything to say that I think you will like to hear , and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter . ” Had
Fanny Price	they , ” he
Fanny Price	a claim . They seem to belong to us ; they seem to be part of ourselves . I could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away . I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected . But the truth is , that my father hardly knows them . They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England . If he knew them better , he would value their society as it deserves ; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like . We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves : my sisters seem out of spirits , and Tom is certainly not at his ease . Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us , and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father . ” “
Fanny Price	It would be delightful to _ me _ to see the progress of it all , ”
Fanny Price	When they are at a distance from all their family , ”
Fanny Price	they can write long letters . ”
Fanny Price	At sea , has she ? In the king ’s service , of course ? ”
Fanny Price	You are fond of the sort of thing ? ”
Fanny Price	Those who see quickly , will resolve quickly , and act quickly , ”
Fanny Price	, Fanny , and how do you like Miss Crawford _ now _ ? ” said
Fanny Price	did you like her yesterday ? ” “
Fanny Price	well — very much . I like to hear her talk . She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her . ” “
Fanny Price	is her countenance that is so attractive . She has a wonderful play of feature ! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you , Fanny , as not quite right ? ” “
Fanny Price	yes ! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did . I was quite astonished . An uncle with whom she has been living so many years , and who , whatever his faults may be , is so very fond of her brother , treating him , they say , quite like a son . I could not have believed it ! ” “
Fanny Price	thought you would be struck . It was very wrong ; very indecorous . ” “
Fanny Price	very ungrateful , I think . ” “
Fanny Price	is a strong word . I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her _ gratitude _ ; his wife certainly had ; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt ’s memory which misleads her here . She is awkwardly circumstanced . With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford , without throwing a shade on the Admiral . I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements , though the Admiral ’s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife ; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely . I do not censure her _ opinions _ ; but there certainly _ is _ impropriety in making them public . ” “
Fanny Price	not you think , ” said
Fanny Price	this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford , as her niece has been entirely brought up by her ? She can not have given her right notions of what was due to the Admiral . ” “
Fanny Price	is a fair remark . Yes , we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt ; and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under . But I think her present home must do her good . Mrs. Grant ’s manners are just what they ought to be . She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection . ” “
Fanny Price	, except as to his writing her such short letters . She made me almost laugh ; but I can not rate so very highly the love or good - nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters , when they are separated . I am sure William would never have used _ me _ so , under any circumstances . And what right had she to suppose that _ you _ would not write long letters when you were absent ? ” “
Fanny Price	was sure she would ride well , ” said
Fanny Price	has the make for it . Her figure is as neat as her brother ’s . ” “
Fanny Price	, ” added
Fanny Price	her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character . I can not but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind . ” When
Fanny Price	shall not ride to - morrow , certainly , ” said
Fanny Price	have been out very often lately , and would rather stay at home . You know I am strong enough now to walk very well . ” Edmund
Fanny Price	must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ” “
Fanny Price	, ” said
Fanny Price	am sure you have the headache . ” She
Fanny Price	know your looks too well . How long have you had it ? ” “
Fanny Price	has been cutting roses , has she ? ” “
Fanny Price	, and I am afraid they will be the last this year . Poor thing ! _ She _ found it hot enough ; but they were so full - blown that one could not wait . ” “
Fanny Price	was no help for it , certainly , ” rejoined
Fanny Price	I question whether her headache might not be caught _ then _ , sister . There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun ; but I dare say it will be well to - morrow . Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar ; I always forget to have mine filled . ” “
Fanny Price	has got it , ” said
Fanny Price	has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . ” “
Fanny Price	! ” cried
Fanny Price	she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma’am ? No wonder her head aches . ” Mrs.
Fanny Price	were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice ? ” “
Fanny Price	; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry ; and , unluckily , Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key , so she was obliged to go again . ” Edmund
Fanny Price	could nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny ? Upon my word , ma’am , it has been a very ill - managed business . ” “
Fanny Price	am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better , ” cried
Fanny Price	I had gone myself , indeed ; but I can not be in two places at once ; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother ’s dairymaid , by _ her _ desire , and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son , and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour . I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . And as for Fanny ’s just stepping down to my house for me — it is not much above a quarter of a mile — I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it . How often do I pace it three times a day , early and late , ay , and in all weathers too , and say nothing about it ? ” “
Fanny Price	wish Fanny had half your strength , ma’am . ” “
Fanny Price	Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon . She has not been out on horseback now this long while , and I am persuaded that , when she does not ride , she ought to walk . If she had been riding before , I should not have asked it of her . But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses ; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind ; and though the sun was strong , it was not so very hot . Between ourselves , Edmund , ” nodding
Fanny Price	am disappointed , ” said
Fanny Price	, ” said
Fanny Price	, ” cried
Fanny Price	have quite convinced Miss Price already . ” “
Fanny Price	wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood ; but the next time we come to a seat , if it is not disagreeable to you , I should be glad to sit down for a little while . ” “
Fanny Price	dear Fanny , ” cried
Fanny Price	thoughtless I have been ! I hope you are not very tired . Perhaps , ” turning
Fanny Price	am afraid you are very tired , Fanny , ” said
Fanny Price	shall soon be rested , ” said
Fanny Price	sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure , is the most perfect refreshment . ” After
Fanny Price	, Miss Crawford , if you will look up the walk , you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long , or half half a mile . ” “
Fanny Price	by this time it is all settled , ” passed
Fanny Price	she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? ” Mrs.
Fanny Price	that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read , and longing to have it to read myself . Did you speak ? ”
Fanny Price	No , ”
Fanny Price	Are you sure you did not speak ? I saw your lips move . I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive , and not _ allow _ my thoughts to wander . Are not you going to tell me so ? ”
Fanny Price	A most desirable Estate in South Wales ”
Fanny Price	To Parents and Guardians ”
Fanny Price	Capital season’d Hunter . ”
Fanny Price	Perhaps , sir , ”
Fanny Price	forgive me . Perhaps I have as yet no right ; but by what other name can I call you ? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other ? No , it is ‘ Fanny ’ that I think of all day , and dream of all night . You have given the name such reality of sweetness , that nothing else can now be descriptive of you . ”
Fanny Price	will speak to her , sir : I will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , ” was
Fanny Price	I ? ” Drawing
Fanny Price	is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together . ” She
Fanny Price	, Fanny , ” he
Fanny Price	order to have a comfortable walk , something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together . You must talk to me . I know you have something on your mind . I know what you are thinking of . You can not suppose me uninformed . Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself ? ” Fanny
Fanny Price	you hear of it from everybody , cousin , there can be nothing for me to tell . ” “
Fanny Price	of facts , perhaps ; but of feelings , Fanny . No one but you can tell me them . I do not mean to press you , however . If it is not what you wish yourself , I have done . I had thought it might be a relief . ” “
Fanny Price	am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what I feel . ” “
Fanny Price	you suppose that we think differently ? I have no idea of it . I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point — I consider Crawford ’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection . I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him . Can there be any disagreement between us here ? ” “
Fanny Price	no ! But I thought you blamed me . I thought you were against me . This is such a comfort ! ” “
Fanny Price	comfort you might have had sooner , Fanny , had you sought it . But how could you possibly suppose me against you ? How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ? Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ” “
Fanny Price	uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . ” “
Fanny Price	far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right . I may be sorry , I may be surprised — though hardly _ that _ , for you had not had time to attach yourself — but I think you perfectly right . Can it admit of a question ? It is disgraceful to us if it does . You did not love him ; nothing could have justified your accepting him . ” Fanny
Fanny Price	him succeed at last , Fanny , let him succeed at last . You have proved yourself upright and disinterested , prove yourself grateful and tender - hearted ; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for . ” “
Fanny Price	! never , never , never ! he never will succeed with me . ” And
Fanny Price	must hope better things . I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years ’ growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation . I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him . I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for . I wish he had known you as well as I do , Fanny . Between us , I think we should have won you . My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed . He should have worked upon my plans . I must hope , however , that time , proving him ( as I firmly believe it will ) to deserve you by his steady affection , will give him his reward . I can not suppose that you have not the _ wish _ to love him — the natural wish of gratitude . You must have some feeling of that sort . You must be sorry for your own indifference . ” “
Fanny Price	are so totally unlike , ” said
Fanny Price	are so very , very different in all our inclinations and ways , that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together , even if I _ could _ like him . There never were two people more dissimilar . We have not one taste in common . We should be miserable . ” “
Fanny Price	are mistaken , Fanny . The dissimilarity is not so strong . You are quite enough alike . You _ have _ tastes in common . You have moral and literary tastes in common . You have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings ; and , Fanny , who that heard him read , and saw you listen to Shakespeare the other night , will think you unfitted as companions ? You forget yourself : there is a decided difference in your tempers , I allow . He is lively , you are serious ; but so much the better : his spirits will support yours . It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are . His cheerfulness will counteract this . He sees difficulties nowhere : and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you . Your being so far unlike , Fanny , does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together : do not imagine it . I am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance . I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike : I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits , in the manners , in the inclination for much or little company , in the propensity to talk or to be silent , to be grave or to be gay . Some opposition here is , I am thoroughly convinced , friendly to matrimonial happiness . I exclude extremes , of course ; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme . A counteraction , gentle and continual , is the best safeguard of manners and conduct . ” Full
Fanny Price	dear Fanny , ” replied
Fanny Price	us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly . The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect . Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself . Compared with me , all the rest were blameless . I was playing the fool with my eyes open . ” “
Fanny Price	a bystander , ” said
Fanny Price	I saw more than you did ; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous . ” “
Fanny Price	possibly . No wonder . Nothing could be more improper than the whole business . I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest . ” “
Fanny Price	the play , I am much mistaken if _ Julia _ did not think he was paying her attentions . ” “
Fanny Price	am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . ” “
Fanny Price	, rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case . How could it be otherwise , with such an education and adviser ? Under the disadvantages , indeed , which both have had , is it not wonderful that they should be what they are ? Crawford ’s _ feelings _ , I am ready to acknowledge , have hitherto been too much his guides . Happily , those feelings have generally been good . You will supply the rest ; and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature — to a woman who , firm as a rock in her own principles , has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them . He has chosen his partner , indeed , with rare felicity . He will make you happy , Fanny ; I know he will make you happy ; but you will make him everything . ” “
Fanny Price	would not engage in such a charge , ” cried
Fanny Price	such an office of high responsibility ! ” “
Fanny Price	knew she would be very angry with me . ” “
Fanny Price	dearest Fanny , ” cried
Fanny Price	not let the idea of her anger distress you . It is anger to be talked of rather than felt . Her heart is made for love and kindness , not for resentment . I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise ; I wish you could have seen her countenance , when she said that you _ should _ be Henry ’s wife . And I observed that she always spoke of you as ‘ Fanny , ’ which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality . ” “
Fanny Price	every woman must have felt the possibility of a man ’s not being approved , not being loved by some one of her sex at least , let him be ever so generally agreeable . Let him have all the perfections in the world , I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself . But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ? He took me wholly by surprise . I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . In my situation , it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford . I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . How , then , was I to be — to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ? How was I to have an attachment at his service , as soon as it was asked for ? His sisters should consider me as well as him . The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him . And , and — we think very differently of the nature of women , if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply . ” “
Fanny Price	dear , dear Fanny , now I have the truth . I know this to be the truth ; and most worthy of you are such feelings . I had attributed them to you before . I thought I could understand you . You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry . I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford ’s addresses was against him . Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character . Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother . She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time , and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years ’ happy marriage . ” Fanny
Fanny Price	spent your time pleasantly there ? ” “
Fanny Price	; that is , it was the fault of my own mind if I did not . They were all very pleasant . I doubt their finding me so . I took uneasiness with me , and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again . ” “
Fanny Price	Miss Owens — you liked them , did not you ? ” “
Fanny Price	, very well . Pleasant , good - humoured , unaffected girls . But I am spoilt , Fanny , for common female society . Good - humoured , unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women . They are two distinct orders of being . You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ” Still
Fanny Price	Oh ! sister , pray do not ask her now ; for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time . It is about Lovers ’ Vows . ”
Fanny Price	Am I right ? Yes ; this is the East room . My dear Miss Price , I beg your pardon , but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help . ”
Fanny Price	Thank you ; I am quite warm , very warm . Allow me to stay here a little while , and do have the goodness to hear me my third act . I have brought my book , and if you would but rehearse it with me , I should be _ so _ obliged ! I came here to - day intending to rehearse it with Edmund — by ourselves — against the evening , but he is not in the way ; and if he _ were _ , I do not think I could go through it with _ him _ , till I have hardened myself a little ; for really there is a speech or two . You will be so good , wo n’t you ? ”
Fanny Price	Here it is . I did not think much of it at first — but , upon my word . There , look at _ that _ speech , and _ that _ , and _ that _ . How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things ? Could you do it ? But then he is your cousin , which makes all the difference . You must rehearse it with me , that I may fancy _ you _ him , and get on by degrees . You _ have _ a look of _ his _ sometimes . ”
Fanny Price	Have I ? I will do my best with the greatest readiness ; but I must _ read _ the part , for I can say very little of it . ”
Fanny Price	_ None _ of it , I suppose . You are to have the book , of course . Now for it . We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage . There — very good school - room chairs , not made for a theatre , I dare say ; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson . What would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose ? Could Sir Thomas look in upon us just now , he would bless himself , for we are rehearsing all over the house . Yates is storming away in the dining - room . I heard him as I came upstairs , and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers , Agatha and Frederick . If _ they _ are not perfect , I _ shall _ be surprised . By the bye , I looked in upon them five minutes ago , and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying _ not _ to embrace , and Mr. Rushworth was with me . I thought he began to look a little queer , so I turned it off as well as I could , by whispering to him , ‘ We shall have an excellent Agatha ; there is something so _ maternal _ in her manner , so completely _ maternal _ in her voice and countenance . ’ Was not that well done of me ? He brightened up directly . Now for my soliloquy . ”
Fanny Price	Dr. Grant is ill , ”
Fanny Price	He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today . He fancied it tough , sent away his plate , and has been suffering ever since ”
Fanny Price	If Miss Price would be so good as to _ read _ the part . ”
Fanny Price	will become of us ? what is to be done now ? ” It
Fanny Price	I _ need not be afraid of appearing before him . ” Her
Fanny Price	the same anxiety for everybody ’s comfort , my dear Mrs. Norris , ” was
Fanny Price	indeed I would rather have nothing but tea . ” “
Fanny Price	, then , Lady Bertram , suppose you speak for tea directly ; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little ; he seems behindhand to - night . ” She
Fanny Price	do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir Thomas ? They have been acting . We have been all alive with acting . ” “
Fanny Price	! and what have you been acting ? ” “
Fanny Price	! they ’ll tell you all about it . ” “
Fanny Price	_ all _ will soon be told , ” cried
Fanny Price	must be done , ” said
Fanny Price	did you leave Miss Crawford , Fanny ? ” Fanny
Fanny Price	After all that I said to her as we came along , I thought she would have behaved better ; I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first . I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper — her poor mother had a good deal ; but we must make allowances for such a child — and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her , for , with all its faults , it _ was _ her home , and she can not as yet understand how much she has changed for the better ; but then there is moderation in all things . ”
Fanny Price	William did not like she should come away ; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed . ”
Fanny Price	But William will write to you , I dare say . ”
Fanny Price	Yes , he had promised he would , but he had told _ her _ to write first . ”
Fanny Price	And when shall you do it ? ”
Fanny Price	she did not know ; she had not any paper . ”
Fanny Price	If that be all your difficulty , I will furnish you with paper and every other material , and you may write your letter whenever you choose . Would it make you happy to write to William ? ”
Fanny Price	Yes , very . ”
Fanny Price	Then let it be done now . Come with me into the breakfast - room , we shall find everything there , and be sure of having the room to ourselves . ”
Fanny Price	But , cousin , will it go to the post ? ”
Fanny Price	Yes , depend upon me it shall : it shall go with the other letters ; and , as your uncle will frank it , it will cost William nothing . ”
Fanny Price	My uncle ! ”
Fanny Price	Yes , when you have written the letter , I will take it to my father to frank . ”
Fanny Price	Dear mama , only think , my cousin can not put the map of Europe together — or my cousin can not tell the principal rivers in Russia — or , she never heard of Asia Minor — or she does not know the difference between water - colours and crayons!—How strange!—Did you ever hear anything so stupid ? ”
Fanny Price	My dear , ”
Fanny Price	it is very bad , but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself . ”
Fanny Price	But , aunt , she is really so very ignorant!—Do you know , we asked her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland ; and she said , she should cross to the Isle of Wight . She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight , and she calls it _ the _ _ Island _ , as if there were no other island in the world . I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself , if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is . I can not remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet . How long ago it is , aunt , since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England , with the dates of their accession , and most of the principal events of their reigns ! ”
Fanny Price	Yes , ”
Fanny Price	and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus ; besides a great deal of the heathen mythology , and all the metals , semi - metals , planets , and distinguished philosophers . ”
Fanny Price	Very true indeed , my dears , but you are blessed with wonderful memories , and your poor cousin has probably none at all . There is a vast deal of difference in memories , as well as in everything else , and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin , and pity her deficiency . And remember that , if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves , you should always be modest ; for , much as you know already , there is a great deal more for you to learn . ”
Fanny Price	Yes , I know there is , till I am seventeen . But I must tell you another thing of Fanny , so odd and so stupid . Do you know , she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing . ”
Fanny Price	To be sure , my dear , that is very stupid indeed , and shows a great want of genius and emulation . But , all things considered , I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so , for , though you know ( owing to me ) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you , it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;—on the contrary , it is much more desirable that there should be a difference . ”
Fanny Price	she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people _ were _ stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . ”
Fanny Price	, he was a short - necked , apoplectic sort of fellow , and , plied well with good things , would soon pop off . ” He
Fanny Price	, my dear ; why should you be astonished ? You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died . But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same . ” The
Fanny Price	shall be very sorry to go away , ” said
Fanny Price	, I dare say you will ; _ that ’s _ natural enough . I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world . ” “
Fanny Price	, my dear ; I hope not . I have always found you a very good girl . ” “
Fanny Price	, my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home . It can make very little difference to you , whether you are in one house or the other . ” Fanny
Fanny Price	; my aunt Bertram has just told me so . It is quite settled . I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there . ” “
Fanny Price	, Fanny , and if the plan were not unpleasant to you , I should call it an excellent one . ” “
Fanny Price	, cousin ! ” “
Fanny Price	has everything else in its favour . My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you . She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere . You will be what you ought to be to her . I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? ” “
Fanny Price	it does : I can not like it . I love this house and everything in it : I shall love nothing there . You know how uncomfortable I feel with her . ” “
Fanny Price	can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so . She never knew how to be pleasant to children . But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her . ” “
Fanny Price	can never be important to any one . ” “
Fanny Price	is to prevent you ? ” “
Fanny Price	. My situation , my foolishness and awkwardness . ” “
Fanny Price	to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly . There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known . You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it . I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion . ” “
Fanny Price	are too kind , ” said
Fanny Price	shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . Oh ! cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . ” “
Fanny Price	, indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House . You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park ; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever . The two families will be meeting every day in the year . The only difference will be that , living with your aunt , you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be . _ Here _ there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with _ her _ you will be forced to speak for yourself . ” “
Fanny Price	can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself , and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be . If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me , it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody . _ Here _ , I know , I am of none , and yet I love the place so well . ” “
Fanny Price	place , Fanny , is what you will not quit , though you quit the house . You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever . Even _ your _ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change . You will have the same walks to frequent , the same library to choose from , the same people to look at , the same horse to ride . ” “
Fanny Price	true . Yes , dear old grey pony ! Ah ! cousin , when I remember how much I used to dread riding , what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good ( oh ! how I have trembled at my uncle ’s opening his lips if horses were talked of ) , and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears , and convince me that I should like it after a little while , and feel how right you proved to be , I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well . ” “
Fanny Price	I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too . ” So
Fanny Price	, I do not know . I suppose he thought it best . ” “
Fanny Price	; he only said he thought it very likely ; and I thought so too . We both thought it would be a comfort to you . But if you do not like it , there is no more to be said . She is no encumbrance here . ” “
Fanny Price	sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ? Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed — what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ? If I could wish it for my own sake , I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl . She is in good hands , and sure of doing well . I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can . ” “
Fanny Price	you will not mind living by yourself quite alone ? ” “
Fanny Price	Bertram , I do not complain . I know I can not live as I have done , but I must retrench where I can , and learn to be a better manager . I _ have _ _ been _ a liberal housekeeper enough , but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now . My situation is as much altered as my income . A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris , as clergyman of the parish , that can not be expected from me . It is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers . At the White House , matters must be better looked after . I _ must _ live within my income , or I shall be miserable ; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more , to lay by a little at the end of the year . ” “
Fanny Price	dare say you will . You always do , do n’t you ? ” “
Fanny Price	object , Lady Bertram , is to be of use to those that come after me . It is for your children ’s good that I wish to be richer . I have nobody else to care for , but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having . ” “
Fanny Price	are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them . They are sure of being well provided for . Sir Thomas will take care of that . ” “
Fanny Price	Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear ! it was a shameful insensibility . ” He
Fanny Price	was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and
Fanny Price	dear Fanny , ” while
Fanny Price	Dear me ! how disagreeable ! I wonder anybody can ever go to sea . ”
Fanny Price	shall I do , Sir Thomas ? Whist and speculation ; which will amuse me most ? ” Sir
Fanny Price	well , ” was
Fanny Price	speculation , if you please , Mrs. Grant . I know nothing about it , but Fanny must teach me . ” Here
Fanny Price	air of a gentleman ’s residence , therefore , you can not but give it , if you do anything . But it is capable of much more . ( Let me see , Mary ; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that queen ; no , no , a dozen is more than it is worth . Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen . She will have nothing to say to it . Go on , go on . ) By some such improvements as I have suggested ( I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan , though , by the bye , I doubt anybody ’s striking out a better ) you may give it a higher character . You may raise it into a _ place _ . From being the mere gentleman ’s residence , it becomes , by judicious improvement , the residence of a man of education , taste , modern manners , good connexions . All this may be stamped on it ; and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road ; especially as there is no real squire ’s house to dispute the point — a circumstance , between ourselves , to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation . _ You _ think with me , I hope ” (
Fanny Price	you ever seen the place ? ” Fanny
Fanny Price	, no , you must not part with the queen . You have bought her too dearly , and your brother does not offer half her value . No , no , sir , hands off , hands off . Your sister does not part with the queen . She is quite determined . The game will be yours , ” turning
Fanny Price	will certainly be yours . ” “
Fanny Price	Fanny had much rather it were William ’s , ” said
Fanny Price	Fanny ! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes ! ” “
Fanny Price	can not say there was much done at Sotherton ; but it was a hot day , and we were all walking after each other , and bewildered . ” As
Fanny Price	! Yes , that is a place , indeed , and we had a charming day there . William , you are quite out of luck ; but the next time you come , I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home , and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly received by both . Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations , and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man . They are at Brighton now , you know ; in one of the best houses there , as Mr. Rushworth ’s fine fortune gives them a right to be . I do not exactly know the distance , but when you get back to Portsmouth , if it is not very far off , you ought to go over and pay your respects to them ; and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins . ” “
Fanny Price	! shame , shame ! But never mind it , William ” (
Fanny Price	is not worth minding . It is no reflection on _ you _ ; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced , more or less , in their time . You must think of that , you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall to every sailor ’s share , like bad weather and hard living , only with this advantage , that there will be an end to it , that there will come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure . When you are a lieutenant ! only think , William , when you are a lieutenant , how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind . ” “
Fanny Price	you fond of dancing , Fanny ? ” “
Fanny Price	, very ; only I am soon tired . ” “
Fanny Price	must be at some other time . There is _ one _ person in company who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of . ” True
Fanny Price	But they are passed over , ”
Fanny Price	I have been watching them . This weather is all from the south . ”
Fanny Price	South or north , I know a black cloud when I see it ; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening . And besides , I want to play something more to you — a very pretty piece — and your cousin Edmund ’s prime favourite . You must stay and hear your cousin ’s favourite . ”
Fanny Price	This is pretty , very pretty , ”
Fanny Price	every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty . Three years ago , this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field , never thought of as anything , or capable of becoming anything ; and now it is converted into a walk , and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament ; and perhaps , in another three years , we may be forgetting — almost forgetting what it was before . How wonderful , how very wonderful the operations of time , and the changes of the human mind ! ”
Fanny Price	It may seem impertinent in _ me _ to praise , but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this . There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk ! Not too much attempted ! ”
Fanny Price	I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive ! ”
Fanny Price	My uncle ’s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own , and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general . The evergreen ! How beautiful , how welcome , how wonderful the evergreen ! When one thinks of it , how astonishing a variety of nature ! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety , but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence . You will think me rhapsodising ; but when I am out of doors , especially when I am sitting out of doors , I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain . One can not fix one ’s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy . ”
Fanny Price	_ Too _ quiet for you , I believe . ”
Fanny Price	Envy Mrs. Rushworth ! ”
Fanny Price	Come , come , it would be very un - handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth , for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay , brilliant , happy hours . I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year . Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing ; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth ’s wife must be to fill her house , and give the best balls in the country . ”
Fanny Price	How differently we feel ! ”
Fanny Price	To me , the sound of _ Mr. _ Bertram is so cold and nothing - meaning , so entirely without warmth or character ! It just stands for a gentleman , and that ’s all . But there is nobleness in the name of Edmund . It is a name of heroism and renown ; of kings , princes , and knights ; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections . ”
Fanny Price	I grant you the name is good in itself , and _ Lord _ Edmund or _ Sir _ Edmund sound delightfully ; but sink it under the chill , the annihilation of a Mr. , and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas . Well , shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year , by being up before they can begin ? ”
Fanny Price	They can not have been sitting long , ”
Fanny Price	for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window , and then they were walking . ”
Fanny Price	And really , ”
Fanny Price	the day is so mild , that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent . Our weather must not always be judged by the calendar . We may sometimes take greater liberties in November than in May . ”
Fanny Price	Do not flatter yourself , my dearest Mary . You have not the smallest chance of moving me . I have my alarms , but they are quite in a different quarter ; and if I could have altered the weather , you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time — for here are some of my plants which Robert _ will _ leave out because the nights are so mild , and I know the end of it will be , that we shall have a sudden change of weather , a hard frost setting in all at once , taking everybody ( at least Robert ) by surprise , and I shall lose every one ; and what is worse , cook has just been telling me that the turkey , which I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday , because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day , will not keep beyond to - morrow . These are something like grievances , and make me think the weather most unseasonably close . ”
Fanny Price	Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer . ”
Fanny Price	Oh ! you can do nothing but what you do already : be plagued very often , and never lose your temper . ”
Fanny Price	But I do look down upon it , if it might have been higher . I must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction . ”
Fanny Price	But how may it rise ? How may my honesty at least rise to any distinction ? ”
Fanny Price	there _ are _ distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance — absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining — but they are of a different character . ”
Fanny Price	but she did not suppose it would be in her power , ”
Fanny Price	And you know what your dinner will be , ”
Fanny Price	cook insists upon the turkey ’s being dressed to - morrow . ”
Fanny Price	Very well , very well , ”
Fanny Price	all the better ; I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house . But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram , I dare say , would take their chance . We none of us want to hear the bill of fare . A friendly meeting , and not a fine dinner , is all we have in view . A turkey , or a goose , or a leg of mutton , or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us . ”
Fanny Price	why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny ? ” said
Fanny Price	came she to think of asking Fanny ? Fanny never dines there , you know , in this sort of way . I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go . Fanny , you do not want to go , do you ? ” “
Fanny Price	you put such a question to her , ” cried
Fanny Price	will immediately say No ; but I am sure , my dear mother , she would like to go ; and I can see no reason why she should not . ” “
Fanny Price	can not imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her ? She never did before . She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny . ” “
Fanny Price	you can not do without me , ma’am — ” said
Fanny Price	my mother will have my father with her all the evening . ” “
Fanny Price	be sure , so I shall . ” “
Fanny Price	you take my father ’s opinion , ma’am . ” “
Fanny Price	’s well thought of . So I will , Edmund . I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . ” “
Fanny Price	you please , ma’am , on that head ; but I meant my father ’s opinion as to the _ propriety _ of the invitation ’s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the _ first _ invitation it should be accepted . ” “
Fanny Price	do not know . We will ask him . But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all . ” There
Fanny Price	strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . ” “
Fanny Price	is it not very natural , ” observed
Fanny Price	Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ” “
Fanny Price	can be more natural , ” said
Fanny Price	, were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural . Mrs. Grant ’s shewing civility to Miss Price , to Lady Bertram ’s niece , could never want explanation . The only surprise I can feel is , that this should be the _ first _ time of its being paid . Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer . She appears to feel as she ought . But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . ” “
Fanny Price	can I do without her , Sir Thomas ? ” “
Fanny Price	I think you may . ” “
Fanny Price	always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . ” “
Fanny Price	sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . ” “
Fanny Price	well , then , Fanny may go , Edmund . ” The
Fanny Price	, Fanny , it is all happily settled , and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle ’s side . He had but one opinion . You are to go . ” “
Fanny Price	you , I am _ so _ glad , ” was
Fanny Price	yet why should I be glad ? for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me ? ” In
Fanny Price	my word , Fanny , you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence ! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated . Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to _ you _ ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me . Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _ us _ to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all . ” Mrs.
Fanny Price	! depend upon it , your aunt can do very well without you , or you would not be allowed to go . _ I _ shall be here , so you may be quite easy about your aunt . And I hope you will have a very _ agreeable _ day , and find it all mighty _ delightful _ . But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table ; and I can not but be surprised that such an _ elegant _ lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better ! And round their enormous great wide table , too , which fills up the room so dreadfully ! Had the doctor been contented to take my dining - table when I came away , as anybody in their senses would have done , instead of having that absurd new one of his own , which is wider , literally wider than the dinner - table here , how infinitely better it would have been ! and how much more he would have been respected ! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere . Remember that , Fanny . Five — only five to be sitting round that table . However , you will have dinner enough on it for ten , I dare say . ” Mrs.
Fanny Price	nonsense and folly of people ’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins — as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia . _ That _ will never do , believe me . Remember , wherever you are , you must be the lowest and last ; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage , you are not to be taking place of her . And as to coming away at night , you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses . Leave him to settle _ that _ . ” “
Fanny Price	, ma’am , I should not think of anything else . ” “
Fanny Price	if it should rain , which I think exceedingly likely , for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life , you must manage as well as you can , and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you . I certainly do not go home to - night , and , therefore , the carriage will not be out on my account ; so you must make up your mind to what may happen , and take your things accordingly . ” Her
Fanny Price	dear Sir Thomas ! ” cried
Fanny Price	can walk . ” “
Fanny Price	niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year ! Will twenty minutes after four suit you ? ” “
Fanny Price	I must look at you , Fanny , ” said
Fanny Price	tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed . What have you got on ? ” “
Fanny Price	new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin ’s marriage . I hope it is not too fine ; but I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could , and that I might not have such another opportunity all the winter . I hope you do not think me too fine . ” “
Fanny Price	woman can never be too fine while she is all in white . No , I see no finery about you ; nothing but what is perfectly proper . Your gown seems very pretty . I like these glossy spots . Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same ? ” In
Fanny Price	! ” said
Fanny Price	’s company , here ’s a carriage ! who have they got to meet us ? ” And
Fanny Price	Tis Crawford ’s , Crawford ’s barouche , I protest ! There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters . He is here , of course . This is quite a surprise , Fanny . I shall be very glad to see him . ” There
Fanny Price	! Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton , I understand ; happy man ! ” “
Fanny Price	, they have been there about a fortnight , Miss Price , have they not ? And Julia is with them . ” “
Fanny Price	Mr. Yates , I presume , is not far off . ” “
Fanny Price	Yates ! Oh ! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates . I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park ; do you , Miss Price ? I think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates . ” “
Fanny Price	Rushworth and his two - and - forty speeches ! ” continued
Fanny Price	can ever forget them . Poor fellow ! I see him now — his toil and his despair . Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ” ;
Fanny Price	happier!—never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable!—never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly ! Oh ! what a corrupted mind ! ” “
Fanny Price	far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day . My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive , that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough . ” She
Fanny Price	believe you are right . It was more pleasant than prudent . We were getting too noisy . ” And
Fanny Price	gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . ” “
Fanny Price	most interesting in the world , ” replied
Fanny Price	amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves . You would look rather blank , Henry , if your _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ were to be limited to seven hundred a year . ” “
Fanny Price	I might ; but all _ that _ you know is entirely comparative . Birthright and habit must settle the business . Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet ’s family . By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year , and nothing to do for it . ” Miss
Fanny Price	, ” said
Fanny Price	shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon . I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner . When is it to be ? Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ? Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time — as I shall do — not to lose a word ; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful ? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil . When will it be ? You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you . ” “
Fanny Price	shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , ” said
Fanny Price	you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . ” “
Fanny Price	, he can feel nothing as he ought . ” The
Fanny Price	are as bad as your brother , Mary ; but we will cure you both . Mansfield shall cure you both , and without any taking in . Stay with us , and we will cure you . ” The
Fanny Price	You must dance with me , Fanny ; you must keep two dances for me ; any two that you like , except the first . ”
Fanny Price	Did he ? Did Edmund ? That was like himself . No other man would have thought of it . I honour him beyond expression . ”
Fanny Price	Perhaps _ you _ can tell me why my brother goes to town to - morrow ? He says he has business there , but will not tell me what . The first time he ever denied me his confidence ! But this is what we all come to . All are supplanted sooner or later . Now , I must apply to you for information . Pray , what is Henry going for ? ”
Fanny Price	Well , then , ”
Fanny Price	I must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother , and of talking of you by the way . ”
Fanny Price	I have been talking incessantly all night , and with nothing to say . But with _ you _ , Fanny , there may be peace . You will not want to be talked to . Let us have the luxury of silence . ”
Fanny Price	So soon ! my good friend , ”
Fanny Price	Well , then , Fanny , you shall not get up to - morrow before I go . Sleep as long as you can , and never mind me . ”
Fanny Price	Oh ! William . ”
Fanny Price	What ! Did she think of being up before you set off ? ”
Fanny Price	Oh ! yes , sir , ”
Fanny Price	Well , well ! ”
Fanny Price	Yes , half - past nine , ”
Fanny Price	and I shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for _ me _ . ”
Fanny Price	I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from . Your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to - morrow . ”
Fanny Price	, yes ; very well ; did you ? did he ? I did not see _ that _ ; I should not know one from the other . ” This
Fanny Price	, ” said
Fanny Price	I wish he was not going away . They are all going away , I think . I wish they would stay at home . ” This
Fanny Price	true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion . If we have been kind to _ her _ , she is now quite as necessary to _ us _ . ” “
Fanny Price	, ” said
Fanny Price	it is a comfort to think that we shall always have _ her _ . ” Sir
Fanny Price	will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . ” “
Fanny Price	_ that _ is not very likely to be , Sir Thomas . Who should invite her ? Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . ” The
Fanny Price	do not know , ” said
Fanny Price	; I had not particularly expected it . ” “
Fanny Price	he will always stay longer than he talks of . It is the general way all young men do . ” “
Fanny Price	did not , the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before . ” “
Fanny Price	finds the house more agreeable _ now _ . He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case . I am looking for Henry every day , and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield . I should like to have seen him once more , I confess . But you must give my compliments to him . Yes ; I think it must be compliments . Is not there a something wanted , Miss Price , in our language — a something between compliments and — and love — to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together ? So many months ’ acquaintance ! But compliments may be sufficient here . Was his letter a long one ? Does he give you much account of what he is doing ? Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for ? ” “
Fanny Price	only heard a part of the letter ; it was to my uncle ; but I believe it was very short ; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines . All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer , and that he had agreed to do so . A _ few _ days longer , or _ some _ days longer ; I am not quite sure which . ” “
Fanny Price	! if he wrote to his father ; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you . But if he wrote to his father , no wonder he was concise . Who could write chat to Sir Thomas ? If he had written to you , there would have been more particulars . You would have heard of balls and parties . He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody . How many Miss Owens are there ? ” “
Fanny Price	grown up . ” “
Fanny Price	they musical ? ” “
Fanny Price	do not at all know . I never heard . ” “
Fanny Price	is the first question , you know , ” said
Fanny Price	every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another . But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies — about any three sisters just grown up ; for one knows , without being told , exactly what they are : all very accomplished and pleasing , and one very pretty . There is a beauty in every family ; it is a regular thing . Two play on the pianoforte , and one on the harp ; and all sing , or would sing if they were taught , or sing all the better for not being taught ; or something like it . ” “
Fanny Price	know nothing of the Miss Owens , ” said
Fanny Price	know nothing and you care less , as people say . Never did tone express indifference plainer . Indeed , how can one care for those one has never seen ? Well , when your cousin comes back , he will find Mansfield very quiet ; all the noisy ones gone , your brother and mine and myself . I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near . She does not like my going . ” Fanny
Fanny Price	can not doubt your being missed by many , ” said
Fanny Price	will be very much missed . ” Miss
Fanny Price	yes ! missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away ; that is , there is a great difference felt . But I am not fishing ; do n’t compliment me . If I _ am _ missed , it will appear . I may be discovered by those who want to see me . I shall not be in any doubtful , or distant , or unapproachable region . ” Now
Fanny Price	, ” said
Fanny Price	do not expect it at all . ” “
Fanny Price	at all ! ” cried
Fanny Price	wonder at that . But I dare say you know exactly — I always imagine you are — perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all — or not at present . ” “
Fanny Price	, I do not , ” said
Fanny Price	is best off as he is , ” and
Fanny Price	A most scandalous , ill - natured rumour has just reached me , and I write , dear Fanny , to warn you against giving the least credit to it , should it spread into the country . Depend upon it , there is some mistake , and that a day or two will clear it up ; at any rate , that Henry is blameless , and in spite of a moment ’s _ etourderie _ , thinks of nobody but you . Say not a word of it ; hear nothing , surmise nothing , whisper nothing till I write again . I am sure it will be all hushed up , and nothing proved but Rushworth ’s folly . If they are gone , I would lay my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park , and Julia with them . But why would not you let us come for you ? I wish you may not repent it.—Yours , etc . ”
Fanny Price	Rushworth , sir . ”
Fanny Price	Yes , sir . ”
Fanny Price	much good may such fine relations do you . I do n’t know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters ; he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less . But , by G — ! if she belonged to _ me _ , I ’d give her the rope ’s end as long as I could stand over her . A little flogging for man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things . ”
Fanny Price	it was with infinite concern the newspaper had to announce to the world a matrimonial _ fracas _ in the family of Mr. R. of Wimpole Street ; the beautiful Mrs. R. , whose name had not long been enrolled in the lists of Hymen , and who had promised to become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world , having quitted her husband ’s roof in company with the well - known and captivating Mr. C. , the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R. , and it was not known even to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone . ”
Fanny Price	It is a mistake , sir , ”
Fanny Price	it must be a mistake , it can not be true ; it must mean some other people . ”
Fanny Price	It might be all a lie , ”
Fanny Price	but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way , that there was no answering for anybody . ”
Fanny Price	Indeed , I hope it is not true , ”
Fanny Price	it would be so very shocking ! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet , I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times ; have not I , Betsey ? And it would not be ten minutes ’ work . ”
Fanny Price	Have you breakfasted ? When shall you be ready ? Does Susan go ? ”
Fanny Price	I heard you were in town , ’ said she ; ‘ I wanted to see you . Let us talk over this sad business . What can equal the folly of our two relations ? ’ I could not answer , but I believe my looks spoke . She felt reproved . Sometimes how quick to feel ! With a graver look and voice she then added , ‘ I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister ’s expense . ’ So she began , but how she went on , Fanny , is not fit , is hardly fit to be repeated to you . I can not recall all her words . I would not dwell upon them if I could . Their substance was great anger at the _ folly _ of each . She reprobated her brother ’s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear . Guess what I must have felt . To hear the woman whom — no harsher name than folly given ! So voluntarily , so freely , so coolly to canvass it ! No reluctance , no horror , no feminine , shall I say , no modest loathings ? This is what the world does . For where , Fanny , shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed ? Spoilt , spoilt ! ” After
Fanny Price	what , ” said
Fanny Price	could you say ? ” “
Fanny Price	am convinced , madam , ” said
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas would not like it . ” “
Fanny Price	, my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ” “
Fanny Price	I were to decline the part , ” said
Fanny Price	would certainly take it . ” “
Fanny Price	! ” cried
Fanny Price	she knew your reasons ! ” “
Fanny Price	, ” cried
Fanny Price	want your services . ” Fanny
Fanny Price	! we do not want to disturb you from your seat . We do not want your _ present _ services . We shall only want you in our play . You must be Cottager ’s wife . ” “
Fanny Price	, but you must , for we can not excuse you . It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ” “
Fanny Price	you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ” cried
Fanny Price	is not that I am afraid of learning by heart , ” said
Fanny Price	I really can not act . ” “
Fanny Price	, indeed , Mr. Bertram , you must excuse me . You can not have an idea . It would be absolutely impossible for me . If I were to undertake it , I should only disappoint you . ” “
Fanny Price	Oh ! my dear William , how glad I am to see you . But have you heard about the Thrush ? She is gone out of harbour already ; three days before we had any thought of it ; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam ’s things , they will never be ready in time ; for she may have her orders to - morrow , perhaps . It takes me quite unawares . And now you must be off for Spithead too . Campbell has been here , quite in a worry about you ; and now what shall we do ? I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you , and here everything comes upon me at once . ”
Fanny Price	Poor dears ! how tired you must both be ! and now , what will you have ? I began to think you would never come . Betsey and I have been watching for you this half - hour . And when did you get anything to eat ? And what would you like to have now ? I could not tell whether you would be for some meat , or only a dish of tea , after your journey , or else I would have got something ready . And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak , and we have no butcher at hand . It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street . We were better off in our last house . Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got . ”
Fanny Price	Then , Betsey , my dear , run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on ; and tell her to bring in the tea - things as soon as she can . I wish we could get the bell mended ; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger . ”
Fanny Price	I was upstairs , mama , moving my things , ”
Fanny Price	You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room ; and I could not get Rebecca to give me any help . ”
Fanny Price	it is so dark you do not see her . ”
Fanny Price	She had been into the kitchen , ”
Fanny Price	to hurry Sally and help make the toast , and spread the bread and butter , or she did not know when they should have got tea , and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey . ”
Fanny Price	What have you got there , my love ? ”
Fanny Price	come and shew it to me . ”
Fanny Price	It was very hard that she was not to have her _ own _ knife ; it was her own knife ; little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed , and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago . But mama kept it from her , and was always letting Betsey get hold of it ; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it , and get it for her own , though mama had _ promised _ her that Betsey should not have it in her own hands . ”
Fanny Price	care of Fanny , mother . She is tender , and not used to rough it like the rest of us . I charge you , take care of Fanny . ” William
Fanny Price	Shall not you wear your brother ’s cross ? ”
Fanny Price	You see what a collection I have , ”
Fanny Price	more by half than I ever use or think of . I do not offer them as new . I offer nothing but an old necklace . You must forgive the liberty , and oblige me . ”
Fanny Price	When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you , ”
Fanny Price	and feel how very kind you were . ”
Fanny Price	You must think of somebody else too , when you wear that necklace , ”
Fanny Price	You must think of Henry , for it was his choice in the first place . He gave it to me , and with the necklace I make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver . It is to be a family remembrancer . The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too . ”
Fanny Price	My dear child , ”
Fanny Price	what are you afraid of ? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine , and fancy you did not come honestly by it ? or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago , before he knew there was such a throat in the world ? or perhaps”—looking archly—“you suspect a confederacy between us , and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire ? ”
Fanny Price	Well , then , ”
Fanny Price	to convince me that you suspect no trick , and are as unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you , take the necklace and say no more about it . Its being a gift of my brother ’s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it , as I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it . He is always giving me something or other . I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half . And as for this necklace , I do not suppose I have worn it six times : it is very pretty , but I never think of it ; and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket - box , you have happened to fix on the very one which , if I have a choice , I would rather part with and see in your possession than any other . Say no more against it , I entreat you . Such a trifle is not worth half so many words . ”
Fanny Price	, ” said
Fanny Price	beg your pardon for being here . I came to look for you , and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in , was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand . You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle — a chain for William ’s cross . You ought to have had it a week ago , but there has been a delay from my brother ’s not being in town by several days so soon as I expected ; and I have only just now received it at Northampton . I hope you will like the chain itself , Fanny . I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste ; but , at any rate , I know you will be kind to my intentions , and consider it , as it really is , a token of the love of one of your oldest friends . ” And
Fanny Price	can not attempt to thank you , ” she
Fanny Price	are out of the question . I feel much more than I can possibly express . Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond — ” “
Fanny Price	that is all you have to say , Fanny ” smiling
Fanny Price	, no , it is not . I want to consult you . ” Almost
Fanny Price	, this is beautiful indeed ! This is the very thing , precisely what I wished for ! This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess . It will exactly suit my cross . They must and shall be worn together . It comes , too , in such an acceptable moment . Oh , cousin , you do not know how acceptable it is . ” “
Fanny Price	what is it that you want to consult me about ? ” It
Fanny Price	the necklace ! No , my dear Fanny , upon no account . It would be mortifying her severely . There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend . Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of ? ” “
Fanny Price	it had been given to me in the first instance , ” said
Fanny Price	should not have thought of returning it ; but being her brother ’s present , is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it , when it is not wanted ? ” “
Fanny Price	must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother ’s gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it . No doubt it is handsomer than mine , and fitter for a ballroom . ” “
Fanny Price	, it is not handsomer , not at all handsomer in its way , and , for my purpose , not half so fit . The chain will agree with William ’s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace . ” “
Fanny Price	one night , Fanny , for only one night , if it _ be _ a sacrifice ; I am sure you will , upon consideration , make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort . Miss Crawford ’s attentions to you have been — not more than you were justly entitled to — I am the last person to think that _ could _ _ be _ , but they have been invariable ; and to be returning them with what must have something the _ air _ of ingratitude , though I know it could never have the _ meaning _ , is not in your nature , I am sure . Wear the necklace , as you are engaged to do , to - morrow evening , and let the chain , which was not ordered with any reference to the ball , be kept for commoner occasions . This is my advice . I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure , and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences , resulting principally from situation , no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship . I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise , ” he
Fanny Price	very dear Fanny , ” which
Fanny Price	I were to find him there again to - day ! ” said
Fanny Price	, ” said
Fanny Price	look tired and fagged , Fanny . You have been walking too far . ” “
Fanny Price	, I have not been out at all . ” “
Fanny Price	you have had fatigues within doors , which are worse . You had better have gone out . ” Fanny
Fanny Price	may guess my errand there , Fanny . ” And
Fanny Price	am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you . This ought to be a day of pleasure . My uncle meant it so . ” “
Fanny Price	yes , yes ! and it will be a day of pleasure . It will all end right . I am only vexed for a moment . In fact , it is not that I consider the ball as ill - timed ; what does it signify ? But , Fanny , ” stopping
Fanny Price	know what all this means . You see how it is ; and could tell me , perhaps better than I could tell you , how and why I am vexed . Let me talk to you a little . You are a kind , kind listener . I have been pained by her manner this morning , and can not get the better of it . I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own , but the influence of her former companions makes her seem — gives to her conversation , to her professed opinions , sometimes a tinge of wrong . She does not _ think _ evil , but she speaks it , speaks it in playfulness ; and though I know it to be playfulness , it grieves me to the soul . ” “
Fanny Price	you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . Do not ask advice of _ me _ . I am not competent . ” “
Fanny Price	are right , Fanny , to protest against such an office , but you need not be afraid . It is a subject on which I should never ask advice ; it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked ; and few , I imagine , do ask it , but when they want to be influenced against their conscience . I only want to talk to you . ” “
Fanny Price	thing more . Excuse the liberty ; but take care _ how _ you talk to me . Do not tell me anything now , which hereafter you may be sorry for . The time may come — ” The
Fanny Price	Fanny ! ” cried
Fanny Price	are all considerate thought ! But it is unnecessary here . The time will never come . No such time as you allude to will ever come . I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had . You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded . How many a time have we talked over her little errors ! You need not fear me ; I have almost given up every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ” He
Fanny Price	, cousin , I am convinced that _ you _ would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not . I can not be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say . Do not check yourself . Tell me whatever you like . ” They
Fanny Price	Miss Price all alone ”
Fanny Price	My dear Fanny , how comes this ? ”
Fanny Price	Yes , there is nothing else to be done . But now , sincerely , do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected ? ”
Fanny Price	No , indeed , far otherwise . I find it better , grander , more complete in its style , though that style may not be the best . And to tell you the truth , ”
Fanny Price	I do not think that _ I _ shall ever see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now . Another summer will hardly improve it to me . ”
Fanny Price	You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world . If other people think Sotherton improved , I have no doubt that you will . ”
Fanny Price	I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points . My feelings are not quite so evanescent , nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world . ”
Fanny Price	You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning . I was glad to see you so well entertained . You and Julia were laughing the whole way . ”
Fanny Price	Were we ? Yes , I believe we were ; but I have not the least recollection at what . Oh ! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my uncle ’s . Your sister loves to laugh . ”
Fanny Price	You think her more light - hearted than I am ? ”
Fanny Price	More easily amused , ”
Fanny Price	consequently , you know , ”
Fanny Price	better company . I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles ’ drive . ”
Fanny Price	Naturally , I believe , I am as lively as Julia , but I have more to think of now . ”
Fanny Price	You have , undoubtedly ; and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility . Your prospects , however , are too fair to justify want of spirits . You have a very smiling scene before you . ”
Fanny Price	Do you mean literally or figuratively ? Literally , I conclude . Yes , certainly , the sun shines , and the park looks very cheerful . But unluckily that iron gate , that ha - ha , give me a feeling of restraint and hardship . ‘ I can not get out , ’ as the starling said . ”
Fanny Price	Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching this key ! ”
Fanny Price	And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr. Rushworth ’s authority and protection , or I think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate , here , with my assistance ; I think it might be done , if you really wished to be more at large , and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited . ”
Fanny Price	Prohibited ! nonsense ! I certainly can get out that way , and I will . Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment , you know ; we shall not be out of sight . ”
Fanny Price	Or if we are , Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll : the grove of oak on the knoll . ”
Fanny Price	You will hurt yourself , Miss Bertram , ”
Fanny Price	you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes ; you will tear your gown ; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha - ha . You had better not go . ”
Fanny Price	A pretty trick , upon my word ! I can not see them anywhere , ”
Fanny Price	But they can not be very far off , and I think I am equal to as much as Maria , even without help . ”
Fanny Price	But , Julia , Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key . Do wait for Mr. Rushworth . ”
Fanny Price	Not I , indeed . I have had enough of the family for one morning . Why , child , I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother . Such a penance as I have been enduring , while you were sitting here so composed and so happy ! It might have been as well , perhaps , if you had been in my place , but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes . ”
Fanny Price	Yes , yes , we saw him . He was posting away as if upon life and death , and could but just spare time to tell us his errand , and where you all were . ”
Fanny Price	It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing . ”
Fanny Price	_ That _ is Miss Maria ’s concern . I am not obliged to punish myself for _ her _ sins . The mother I could not avoid , as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper , but the son I _ can _ get away from . ”
Fanny Price	They desired me to stay — my cousin Maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll , or thereabouts . ”
Fanny Price	Miss Bertram thought you would follow her . ”
Fanny Price	I should not have had to follow her if she had staid . ”
Fanny Price	Handsome ! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome . He is not five foot nine . I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight . I think he is an ill - looking fellow . In my opinion , these Crawfords are no addition at all . We did very well without them . ”
Fanny Price	If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key , there might have been some excuse , but I went the very moment she said she wanted it . ”
Fanny Price	Nothing could be more obliging than your manner , I am sure , and I dare say you walked as fast as you could ; but still it is some distance , you know , from this spot to the house , quite into the house ; and when people are waiting , they are bad judges of time , and every half minute seems like five . ”
Fanny Price	wished he had had the key about him at the time . ”
Fanny Price	It is a pity you should not join them . They expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park , and will be thinking how it may be improved ; and nothing of that sort , you know , can be settled without you . ”
Fanny Price	Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end ! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go . A pretty good day ’s amusement you have had ! ”
Fanny Price	I think _ you _ have done pretty well yourself , ma’am . Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . ”
Fanny Price	do not wonder at your disapprobation , upon my word . It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self - indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours . Fanny , it goes against us . We can not attempt to defend Dr. Grant . ” “
Fanny Price	No ; not quite a month . It is only four weeks to - morrow since I left Mansfield . ”
Fanny Price	You are a most accurate and honest reckoner . I should call that a month . ”
Fanny Price	I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening . ”
Fanny Price	And it is to be a two months ’ visit , is not ? ”
Fanny Price	Yes . My uncle talked of two months . I suppose it will not be less . ”
Fanny Price	And how are you to be conveyed back again ? Who comes for you ? ”
Fanny Price	I do not know . I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt . Perhaps I may be to stay longer . It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months ’ end . ”
Fanny Price	you find yourself growing unwell , and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield , without waiting for the two months to be ended , _ that _ must not be regarded as of any consequence , if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual , and will only let my sister know it , give her only the slightest hint , she and I will immediately come down , and take you back to Mansfield . You know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done . You know all that would be felt on the occasion . ”
Fanny Price	Have you no message for anybody ? ”
Fanny Price	My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ”
Fanny Price	Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ”
Fanny Price	I am not cold , sir : I never sit here long at this time of year . ”
Fanny Price	But you have a fire in general ? ”
Fanny Price	No , sir . ”
Fanny Price	How comes this about ? Here must be some mistake . I understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable . In your bedchamber I know you _ can not _ have a fire . Here is some great misapprehension which must be rectified . It is highly unfit for you to sit , be it only half an hour a day , without a fire . You are not strong . You are chilly . Your aunt can not be aware of this . ”
Fanny Price	my aunt Norris ”
Fanny Price	You are not aware , perhaps , that I have had a visitor this morning . I had not been long in my own room , after breakfast , when Mr. Crawford was shewn in . His errand you may probably conjecture . ”
Fanny Price	Out of your power to return his good opinion ? What is all this ? I know he spoke to you yesterday , and ( as far as I understand ) received as much encouragement to proceed as a well - judging young woman could permit herself to give . I was very much pleased with what I collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion ; it shewed a discretion highly to be commended . But now , when he has made his overtures so properly , and honourably — what are your scruples _ now _ ? ”
Fanny Price	Yes , sir . ”
Fanny Price	Refuse him ? ”
Fanny Price	Yes , sir . ”
Fanny Price	Refuse Mr. Crawford ! Upon what plea ? For what reason ? ”
Fanny Price	I — I can not like him , sir , well enough to marry him . ”
Fanny Price	There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach . Here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you , with everything to recommend him : not merely situation in life , fortune , and character , but with more than common agreeableness , with address and conversation pleasing to everybody . And he is not an acquaintance of to - day ; you have now known him some time . His sister , moreover , is your intimate friend , and he has been doing _ that _ for your brother , which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you , had there been no other . It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William on . He has done it already . ”
Fanny Price	Oh yes , sir ! indeed I do . His attentions were always — what I did not like . ”
Fanny Price	This is beyond me , ”
Fanny Price	This requires explanation . Young as you are , and having seen scarcely any one , it is hardly possible that your affections — ”
Fanny Price	Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford ’s _ choice _ seemed to justify ”
Fanny Price	Edmund , I consider , from his dispositions and habits , as much more likely to marry early than his brother . _ He _ , indeed , I have lately thought , has seen the woman he could love , which , I am convinced , my eldest son has not . Am I right ? Do you agree with me , my dear ? ”
Fanny Price	Have you any reason , child , to think ill of Mr. Crawford ’s temper ? ”
Fanny Price	But of his principles I have ”
Fanny Price	And I should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters , on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only _ half _ the eligibility of _ this _ , immediately and peremptorily , and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation , put a decided negative on it . I should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding . I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect . _ You _ are not to be judged by the same rule . You do not owe me the duty of a child . But , Fanny , if your heart can acquit you of _ ingratitude _ — ”
Fanny Price	I am very sorry , ”
Fanny Price	I am very sorry indeed . ”
Fanny Price	Sorry ! yes , I hope you are sorry ; and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day ’s transactions . ”
Fanny Price	I shall make no mention below of what has passed ; I shall not even tell your aunt Bertram . There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment ; say nothing about it yourself . ”
Fanny Price	I must be a brute , indeed , if I can be really ungrateful ! ”
Fanny Price	Heaven defend me from being ungrateful ! ”
Fanny Price	If I had known you were going out , I should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny , ”
Fanny Price	which I have since , to my very great inconvenience , been obliged to go and carry myself . I could very ill spare the time , and you might have saved me the trouble , if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out . It would have made no difference to you , I suppose , whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house . ”
Fanny Price	Oh ! ”
Fanny Price	that was very kind of you , Sir Thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house . Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there , I assure you , with the advantage of being of some use , and obliging her aunt : it is all her fault . If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a something about Fanny , I have often observed it before — she likes to go her own way to work ; she does not like to be dictated to ; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can ; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy , and independence , and nonsense , about her , which I would advise her to get the better of . ”
Fanny Price	Stay , stay , Fanny ! what are you about ? where are you going ? do n’t be in such a hurry . Depend upon it , it is not you who are wanted ; depend upon it , it is me ”
Fanny Price	No , ma’am , it is Miss Price ; I am certain of its being Miss Price . ”
Fanny Price	I do not think you would answer the purpose at all . ”
Fanny Price	, sir , ” said
Fanny Price	am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to — I know that it is paying me a very great compliment , and I feel most undeservedly honoured ; but I am so perfectly convinced , and I have told him so , that it never will be in my power — ” “
Fanny Price	dear , ” interrupted
Fanny Price	is no occasion for this . Your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you . There is nothing more to be said or done . From this hour the subject is never to be revived between us . You will have nothing to fear , or to be agitated about . You can not suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations . Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford ’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his . He proceeds at his own risk . You are on safe ground . I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred . You will see him with the rest of us , in the same manner , and , as much as you can , dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant . He leaves Northamptonshire so soon , that even this slight sacrifice can not be often demanded . The future must be very uncertain . And now , my dear Fanny , this subject is closed between us . ” The
Fanny Price	, Fanny , ” said
Fanny Price	, Fanny , I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning . I must just speak of it _ once _ , I told Sir Thomas I must _ once _ , and then I shall have done . I give you joy , my dear niece . ” And
Fanny Price	, we certainly are a handsome family ! ” Fanny
Fanny Price	dear aunt , _ you _ can not wish me to do differently from what I have done , I am sure . _ You _ can not wish me to marry ; for you would miss me , should not you ? Yes , I am sure you would miss me too much for that . ” “
Fanny Price	, my dear , I should not think of missing you , when such an offer as this comes in your way . I could do very well without you , if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford . And you must be aware , Fanny , that it is every young woman ’s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this . ” This
Fanny Price	will tell you what , Fanny , ” said
Fanny Price	am sure he fell in love with you at the ball ; I am sure the mischief was done that evening . You did look remarkably well . Everybody said so . Sir Thomas said so . And you know you had Chapman to help you to dress . I am very glad I sent Chapman to you . I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening . ” And
Fanny Price	I will tell you what , Fanny , which is more than I did for Maria : the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy . ”
Fanny Price	Come in ”
Fanny Price	Yes , certainly . ”
Fanny Price	My opinion ! ”
Fanny Price	Yes , your advice and opinion . I do not know what to do . This acting scheme gets worse and worse , you see . They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could , and now , to complete the business , are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us . This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first . I know no harm of Charles Maddox ; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable , the _ more _ than intimacy — the familiarity . I can not think of it with any patience ; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must , _ if _ _ possible _ , be prevented . Do not you see it in the same light ? ”
Fanny Price	Yes ; but what can be done ? Your brother is so determined . ”
Fanny Price	There is but _ one _ thing to be done , Fanny . I must take Anhalt myself . I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom . ”
Fanny Price	It is not at all what I like , ”
Fanny Price	No man can like being driven into the _ appearance _ of such inconsistency . After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning , there is absurdity in the face of my joining them _ now _ , when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect ; but I can think of no other alternative . Can you , Fanny ? ”
Fanny Price	No , ”
Fanny Price	not immediately , but — ”
Fanny Price	But what ? I see your judgment is not with me . Think it a little over . Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that _ may _ , of the unpleasantness that _ must _ arise from a young man ’s being received in this manner : domesticated among us ; authorised to come at all hours , and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints . To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create . It is all very bad ! Put yourself in Miss Crawford ’s place , Fanny . Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger . She has a right to be felt for , because she evidently feels for herself . I heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger ; and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations — perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be — it would be ungenerous , it would be really wrong to expose her to it . Her feelings ought to be respected . Does it not strike you so , Fanny ? You hesitate . ”
Fanny Price	I am sorry for Miss Crawford ; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against , and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle . It will be such a triumph to the others ! ”
Fanny Price	They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously I act . But , however , triumph there certainly will be , and I must brave it . But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business , of limiting the exhibition , of concentrating our folly , I shall be well repaid . As I am now , I have no influence , I can do nothing : I have offended them , and they will not hear me ; but when I have put them in good - humour by this concession , I am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for . This will be a material gain . My object is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants . Will not this be worth gaining ? ”
Fanny Price	Yes , it will be a great point . ”
Fanny Price	But still it has not your approbation . Can you mention any other measure by which I have a chance of doing equal good ? ”
Fanny Price	No , I can not think of anything else . ”
Fanny Price	Give me your approbation , then , Fanny . I am not comfortable without it . ”
Fanny Price	Oh , cousin ! ”
Fanny Price	If you are against me , I ought to distrust myself , and yet — But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act — no matter whom : the look of a gentleman is to be enough . I thought _ you _ would have entered more into Miss Crawford ’s feelings . ”
Fanny Price	No doubt she will be very glad . It must be a great relief to her , ”
Fanny Price	She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night . It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill . ”
Fanny Price	She _ was _ very kind , indeed , and I am glad to have her spared ”
Fanny Price	have it quite in their own family circle was what they had particularly wished . A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort ” ;
Fanny Price	, ” said
Fanny Price	may be more disposed to oblige us now . Perhaps you may persuade _ her _ . ” “
Fanny Price	, she is quite determined . She certainly will not act . ” “
Fanny Price	! very well . ” And
Fanny Price	had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth . It may do _ her _ some good . I often think of Mr. Rushworth ’s property and independence , and wish them in other hands ; but I never think of him . A man might represent the county with such an estate ; a man might escape a profession and represent the county . ” “
Fanny Price	dare say he _ will _ be in parliament soon . When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet . ” “
Fanny Price	Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , ” said
Fanny Price	you remember Hawkins Browne ’s ‘ Address to Tobacco , ’ in imitation of Pope ? — Blest leaf ! whose aromatic gales dispense To Templars modesty , to Parsons sense . I will parody them — Blest Knight ! whose dictatorial looks dispense To Children affluence , to Rushworth sense . Will not that do , Mrs. Grant ? Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas ’s return . ” “
Fanny Price	will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you . I do not think we do so well without him . He has a fine dignified manner , which suits the head of such a house , and keeps everybody in their place . Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order . But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry . I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends , I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ” “
Fanny Price	would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ” “
Fanny Price	you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ” Julia
Henry Crawford	What a favourite he is with my cousins ! ”
Henry Crawford	Yes , his manners to women are such as must please . Mrs. Grant , I believe , suspects him of a preference for Julia ; I have never seen much symptom of it , but I wish it may be so . He has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove . ”
Henry Crawford	Which is , perhaps , more in favour of his liking Julia best , than you , Fanny , may be aware ; for I believe it often happens that a man , before he has quite made up his own mind , will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself . Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria ; and I am not at all afraid for her , after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong . ”
Henry Crawford	I dare say he did , ma’am . Mr. Rushworth is never remiss . But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety , so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays , Mrs. Rushworth — that wish of avoiding particularity ! Dear ma’am , only look at her face at this moment ; how different from what it was the two last dances ! ”
Henry Crawford	The couple above , ma’am . Do you see no symptoms there ? ”
Henry Crawford	Oh dear ! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford . Yes , indeed , a very pretty match . What is his property ? ”
Henry Crawford	Four thousand a year . ”
Henry Crawford	Very well . Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have . Four thousand a year is a pretty estate , and he seems a very genteel , steady young man , so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy . ”
Henry Crawford	It is not a settled thing , ma’am , yet . We only speak of it among friends . But I have very little doubt it _ will _ be . He is growing extremely particular in his attentions . ”
Henry Crawford	If you want to dance , Fanny , I will stand up with you . ”
Henry Crawford	I am glad of it , ”
Henry Crawford	for I am tired to death . I only wonder how the good people can keep it up so long . They had need be _ all _ in love , to find any amusement in such folly ; and so they are , I fancy . If you look at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers — all but Yates and Mrs. Grant — and , between ourselves , she , poor woman , must want a lover as much as any one of them . A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor , ”
Henry Crawford	A strange business this in America , Dr. Grant ! What is your opinion ? I always come to you to know what I am to think of public matters . ”
Henry Crawford	I should be most happy , ”
Henry Crawford	it would give me the greatest pleasure ; but that I am this moment going to dance . Come , Fanny , ”
Henry Crawford	are not serious , Tom , in meaning to act ? ” said
Henry Crawford	really believe , ” said
Henry Crawford	could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written , from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat . I feel as if I could be anything or everything ; as if I could rant and storm , or sigh or cut capers , in any tragedy or comedy in the English language . Let us be doing something . Be it only half a play , an act , a scene ; what should prevent us ? Not these countenances , I am sure , ” looking
Henry Crawford	want of hands in our theatre , Miss Bertram . No want of understrappers : my sister desires her love , and hopes to be admitted into the company , and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante , that you may not like to do yourselves . ” Maria
Henry Crawford	There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford ’s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ? Why should not we make a little party ? Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford ’s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _ their _ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and then we could all return to a late dinner here , or dine at Sotherton , just as might be most agreeable to your mother , and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight . I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you . ”
Henry Crawford	, girls ; come , Fan ; come , Sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! ” he
Henry Crawford	She often reads to me out of those books ; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man’s — what ’s his name , Fanny?—when we heard your footsteps . ”
Henry Crawford	Let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship , ”
Henry Crawford	I shall find it immediately . ”
Henry Crawford	Sir , you do me honour , ”
Henry Crawford	It was really like being at a play , ”
Henry Crawford	I wish Sir Thomas had been here . ”
Henry Crawford	You have a great turn for acting , I am sure , Mr. Crawford , ”
Henry Crawford	and I will tell you what , I think you will have a theatre , some time or other , at your house in Norfolk . I mean when you are settled there . I do indeed . I think you will fit up a theatre at your house in Norfolk . ”
Henry Crawford	Do you , ma’am ? ”
Henry Crawford	No , no , that will never be . Your ladyship is quite mistaken . No theatre at Everingham ! Oh no ! ”
Henry Crawford	Our liturgy , ”
Henry Crawford	has beauties , which not even a careless , slovenly style of reading can destroy ; but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt . For myself , at least , I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be ”
Henry Crawford	No , indeed , you know your duty too well for me to — even supposing — ”
Henry Crawford	A sermon , well delivered , is more uncommon even than prayers well read . A sermon , good in itself , is no rare thing . It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well ; that is , the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study . A thoroughly good sermon , thoroughly well delivered , is a capital gratification . I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect , and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself . There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit , when it is really eloquence , which is entitled to the highest praise and honour . The preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers , on subjects limited , and long worn threadbare in all common hands ; who can say anything new or striking , anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste , or wearing out the feelings of his hearers , is a man whom one could not , in his public capacity , honour enough . I should like to be such a man . ”
Henry Crawford	I should indeed . I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy . But then , I must have a London audience . I could not preach but to the educated ; to those who were capable of estimating my composition . And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often ; now and then , perhaps once or twice in the spring , after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together ; but not for a constancy ; it would not do for a constancy . ”
Henry Crawford	What did that shake of the head mean ? ”
Henry Crawford	What was it meant to express ? Disapprobation , I fear . But of what ? What had I been saying to displease you ? Did you think me speaking improperly , lightly , irreverently on the subject ? Only tell me if I was . Only tell me if I was wrong . I want to be set right . Nay , nay , I entreat you ; for one moment put down your work . What did that shake of the head mean ? ”
Henry Crawford	Pray , sir , do n’t ; pray , Mr. Crawford , ”
Henry Crawford	How can you , sir ? You quite astonish me ; I wonder how you can — ”
Henry Crawford	Do I astonish you ? ”
Henry Crawford	Do you wonder ? Is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand ? I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner , all that gives me an interest in what you look and do , and excites my present curiosity . I will not leave you to wonder long . ”
Henry Crawford	You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy . Yes , that was the word . Constancy : I am not afraid of the word . I would spell it , read it , write it with anybody . I see nothing alarming in the word . Did you think I ought ? ”
Henry Crawford	Well , ”
Henry Crawford	I am happier than I was , because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me . You think me unsteady : easily swayed by the whim of the moment , easily tempted , easily put aside . With such an opinion , no wonder that — But we shall see.—It is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged ; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady . My conduct shall speak for me ; absence , distance , time shall speak for me . _ They _ shall prove that , as far as you can be deserved by anybody , I do deserve you . You are infinitely my superior in merit ; all _ that _ I know . You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature . You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what — not merely beyond what one sees , because one never sees anything like it — but beyond what one fancies might be . But still I am not frightened . It is not by equality of merit that you can be won . That is out of the question . It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest , who loves you most devotedly , that has the best right to a return . There I build my confidence . By that right I do and will deserve you ; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it , I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes . Yes , dearest , sweetest Fanny . Nay ”
Henry Crawford	mean , ” she
Henry Crawford	I _ think _ I never shall , as far as the future can be answered for ; I think I never shall return his regard . ” “
Henry Crawford	is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _ that _ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more . I must say , cousin , that I can not approve his character . I have not thought well of him from the time of the play . I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly — I may speak of it now because it is all over — so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which — in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over . ” “
Henry Crawford	Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean ? ”
Henry Crawford	You have only to _ read _ the part , ”
Henry Crawford	is time to think of our visitors , ” said
Henry Crawford	Crawford was a most pleasant , gentleman - like man ; his sister a sweet , pretty , elegant , lively girl . ” Mr.
Henry Crawford	no ”
Henry Crawford	yes ”
Henry Crawford	no ”
Henry Crawford	You have been here a month , I think ? ”
Henry Crawford	I know Mansfield , I know its way , I know its faults towards _ you _ . I know the danger of your being so far forgotten , as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family . I am aware that you may be left here week after week , if Sir Thomas can not settle everything for coming himself , or sending your aunt ’s maid for you , without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year . This will not do . Two months is an ample allowance ; I should think six weeks quite enough . I am considering your sister ’s health , ”
Henry Crawford	which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to . She requires constant air and exercise . When you know her as well as I do , I am sure you will agree that she does , and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country . If , therefore ”
Henry Crawford	I am perfectly serious , ”
Henry Crawford	as you perfectly know . And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition . Indeed , you shall _ not _ ; it shall not be in your power ; for so long only as you positively say , in every letter to Mary , ‘ I am well , ’ and I know you can not speak or write a falsehood , so long only shall you be considered as well . ”
Henry Crawford	I advise ! You know very well what is right . ”
Henry Crawford	Yes . When you give me your opinion , I always know what is right . Your judgment is my rule of right . ”
Henry Crawford	Oh , no ! do not say so . We have all a better guide in ourselves , if we would attend to it , than any other person can be . Good - bye ; I wish you a pleasant journey to - morrow . ”
Henry Crawford	Is there nothing I can do for you in town ? ”
Henry Crawford	Nothing ; I am much obliged to you . ”
Henry Crawford	had almost forgot ( it was Edmund ’s fault : he gets into my head more than does me good ) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself — I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire . My dear little creature , do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks . Those vile sea - breezes are the ruin of beauty and health . My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea , which the Admiral of course never believed , but I know it was so . I am at your service and Henry ’s , at an hour ’s notice . I should like the scheme , and we would make a little circuit , and shew you Everingham in our way , and perhaps you would not mind passing through London , and seeing the inside of St. George ’s , Hanover Square . Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time : I should not like to be tempted . What a long letter ! one word more . Henry , I find , has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that _ you _ approve ; but this can not possibly be permitted before the middle of next week ; that is , he can not anyhow be spared till after the 14th , for _ we _ have a party that evening . The value of a man like Henry , on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable . He will see the Rushworths , which I own I am not sorry for — having a little curiosity , and so I think has he — though he will not acknowledge it . ” This
Henry Crawford	If it were possible for me to do otherwise ”
Henry Crawford	but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ”
Henry Crawford	Well , ”
Henry Crawford	well , child , dry up your tears . There is no use in these tears ; they can do no good . You must now come downstairs with me . Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already . You must give him your own answer : we can not expect him to be satisfied with less ; and you only can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments , which , unfortunately for himself , he certainly has imbibed . I am totally unequal to it . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	My dear Henry , where can you have been all this time ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sitting with them an hour and a half ! ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	so it shall be ” closed
Sir Thomas Bertram	We have all been more or less to blame , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	every one of us , excepting Fanny . Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout ; who has been consistent . _ Her _ feelings have been steadily against it from first to last . She never ceased to think of what was due to you . You will find Fanny everything you could wish . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I know how great , how justly great , your influence is with Lady Bertram and her children , and am the more concerned that it should not have been — ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	My dear Sir Thomas , if you had seen the state of the roads _ that _ day ! I thought we should never have got through them , though we had the four horses of course ; and poor old coachman would attend us , out of his great love and kindness , though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas . I cured him at last ; but he was very bad all the winter — and this was such a day , I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture : he was putting on his wig ; so I said , ‘ Coachman , you had much better not go ; your Lady and I shall be very safe ; you know how steady Stephen is , and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now , that I am sure there is no fear . ’ But , however , I soon found it would not do ; he was bent upon going , and as I hate to be worrying and officious , I said no more ; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt , and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke , where , what with frost and snow upon beds of stones , it was worse than anything you can imagine , I was quite in an agony about him . And then the poor horses too ! To see them straining away ! You know how I always feel for the horses . And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill , what do you think I did ? You will laugh at me ; but I got out and walked up . I did indeed . It might not be saving them much , but it was something , and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals . I caught a dreadful cold , but _ that _ I did not regard . My object was accomplished in the visit . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it . There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth ’s manners , but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject : his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting . He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Yes , indeed , and the more you know of him the better you will like him . He is not a shining character , but he has a thousand good qualities ; and is so disposed to look up to you , that I am quite laughed at about it , for everybody considers it as my doing . ‘ Upon my word , Mrs. Norris , ’ said Mrs. Grant the other day , ‘ if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own , he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect . ’ ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	It is about my uncle ’s usual time . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	When do you think of going ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I may , perhaps , get as far as Banbury to - day . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	you think so ? ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	my opinion , my uncle would not like _ any _ addition . I think he values the very quietness you speak of , and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants . And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be — I mean before my uncle went abroad . As well as I can recollect , it was always much the same . There was never much laughing in his presence ; or , if there is any difference , it is not more , I think , than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first . There must be a sort of shyness ; but I can not recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry , except when my uncle was in town . No young people ’s are , I suppose , when those they look up to are at home ” .
Sir Thomas Bertram	believe you are right , Fanny , ” was
Sir Thomas Bertram	believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were , than assuming a new character . The novelty was in their being lively . Yet , how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give ! I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	suppose I am graver than other people , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	evenings do not appear long to me . I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies . I could listen to him for an hour together . It entertains _ me _ more than many other things have done ; but then I am unlike other people , I dare say . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	should you dare say _ that _ ? ” (
Sir Thomas Bertram	you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet ? But when did you , or anybody , ever get a compliment from me , Fanny ? Go to my father if you want to be complimented . He will satisfy you . Ask your uncle what he thinks , and you will hear compliments enough : and though they may be chiefly on your person , you must put up with it , and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time . ” Such
Sir Thomas Bertram	! do n’t talk so , do n’t talk so , ” cried
Sir Thomas Bertram	I do talk to him more than I used . I am sure I do . Did not you hear me ask him about the slave - trade last night ? ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	did — and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others . It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	I longed to do it — but there was such a dead silence ! And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word , or seeming at all interested in the subject , I did not like — I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense , by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day : that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect . We were talking of you at the Parsonage , and those were her words . She has great discernment . I know nobody who distinguishes characters better . For so young a woman it is remarkable ! She certainly understands _ you _ better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long ; and with regard to some others , I can perceive , from occasional lively hints , the unguarded expressions of the moment , that she could define _ many _ as accurately , did not delicacy forbid it . I wonder what she thinks of my father ! She must admire him as a fine - looking man , with most gentlemanlike , dignified , consistent manners ; but perhaps , having seen him so seldom , his reserve may be a little repulsive . Could they be much together , I feel sure of their liking each other . He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers . I wish they met more frequently ! I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	have any such apprehension . And Sir Thomas ’s wishing just at first to be only with his family , is so very natural , that she can argue nothing from that . After a little while , I dare say , we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way , allowing for the difference of the time of year . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	is the first October that she has passed in the country since her infancy . I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . ” Fanny
Sir Thomas Bertram	- morrow , I think , my uncle dines at Sotherton , and you and Mr. Bertram too . We shall be quite a small party at home . I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	is impossible , Fanny . He must like him less after to - morrow ’s visit , for we shall be five hours in his company . I should dread the stupidity of the day , if there were not a much greater evil to follow — the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas . He can not much longer deceive himself . I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ” In
Sir Thomas Bertram	where is Fanny ? Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and on perceiving her , came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her , calling her his dear Fanny , kissing her affectionately , and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown ! Fanny knew not how to feel , nor where to look . She was quite oppressed . He had never been so kind , so _ very _ kind to her in his life . His manner seemed changed , his voice was quick from the agitation of joy ; and all that had been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness . He led her nearer the light and looked at her again — inquired particularly after her health , and then , correcting himself , observed that he need not inquire , for her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point . A fine blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face , he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty . He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him . Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party , who at his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire . He had the best right to be the talker ; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house , in the centre of his family , after such a separation , made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree ; and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage , and answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put . His business in Antigua had latterly been prosperously rapid , and he came directly from Liverpool , having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel , instead of waiting for the packet ; and all the little particulars of his proceedings and events , his arrivals and departures , were most promptly delivered , as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him — interrupting himself more than once , however , to remark on his good fortune in finding them all at home — coming unexpectedly as he did — all collected together exactly as he could have wished , but dared not depend on . Mr. Rushworth was not forgotten : a most friendly reception and warmth of hand - shaking had already met him , and with pointed attention he was now included in the objects most intimately connected with Mansfield . There was nothing disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth ’s appearance , and Sir Thomas was liking him already . By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken , unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife , who was really extremely happy to see him , and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years . She had been _ almost _ fluttered for a few minutes , and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away her work , move Pug from her side , and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband . She had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _ her _ pleasure : her own time had been irreproachably spent during his absence : she had done a great deal of carpet - work , and made many yards of fringe ; and she would have answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the young people as for her own . It was so agreeable to her to see him again , and hear him talk , to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives , that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she must have missed him , and how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened absence . Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister . Not that _ she _ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas ’s disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known , for her judgment had been so blinded that , except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth ’s pink satin cloak as her brother - in - law entered , she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm ; but she was vexed by the _ manner _ of his return . It had left her nothing to do . Instead of being sent for out of the room , and seeing him first , and having to spread the happy news through the house , Sir Thomas , with a very reasonable dependence , perhaps , on the nerves of his wife and children , had sought no confidant but the butler , and had been following him almost instantaneously into the drawing - room . Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended , whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded ; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about , and labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and silence . Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat , she might have gone to the housekeeper with troublesome directions , and insulted the footmen with injunctions of despatch ; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner : he would take nothing , nothing till tea came — he would rather wait for tea . Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different ; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England , when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height , she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup . “ Sure , my dear Sir Thomas , a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea . Do have a basin of soup . ” Sir
Sir Thomas Bertram	it is not worth while to bore my father with it now . You will hear enough of it to - morrow , sir . We have just been trying , by way of doing something , and amusing my mother , just within the last week , to get up a few scenes , a mere trifle . We have had such incessant rains almost since October began , that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together . I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd . Tolerable sport the first three days , but there has been no attempting anything since . The first day I went over Mansfield Wood , and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton , and we brought home six brace between us , and might each have killed six times as many , but we respect your pheasants , sir , I assure you , as much as you could desire . I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were . _ I _ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year . I hope you will take a day ’s sport there yourself , sir , soon . ” For
Sir Thomas Bertram	poor Yates is all alone , ” cried
Sir Thomas Bertram	will go and fetch him . He will be no bad assistant when it all comes out . ” To
Sir Thomas Bertram	come from your theatre , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	found myself in it rather unexpectedly . Its vicinity to my own room — but in every respect , indeed , it took me by surprise , as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character . It appears a neat job , however , as far as I could judge by candlelight , and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit . ” And
Sir Thomas Bertram	your judgment , Edmund , I depended ; what have you been about ? ” She
Sir Thomas Bertram	, not to _ him _ ! Look so to all the others , but not to _ him _ ! ” Mr.
Sir Thomas Bertram	own the truth , Sir Thomas , we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening . We were going through the three first acts , and not unsuccessfully upon the whole . Our company is now so dispersed , from the Crawfords being gone home , that nothing more can be done to - night ; but if you will give us the honour of your company to - morrow evening , I should not be afraid of the result . We bespeak your indulgence , you understand , as young performers ; we bespeak your indulgence . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	indulgence shall be given , sir , ” replied
Sir Thomas Bertram	without any other rehearsal . ” And
Sir Thomas Bertram	am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same . It gives me sincere satisfaction . That I should be cautious and quick - sighted , and feel many scruples which my children do _ not _ feel , is perfectly natural ; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity , for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures , should much exceed theirs . But at your time of life to feel all this , is a most favourable circumstance for yourself , and for everybody connected with you ; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight . ” Sir
Sir Thomas Bertram	blush for you , Tom , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion . You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his . It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . ” Tom
Sir Thomas Bertram	And how do you think I mean to amuse myself , Mary , on the days that I do not hunt ? I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week ; but I have a plan for the intermediate days , and what do you think it is ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	To walk and ride with me , to be sure . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Not exactly , though I shall be happy to do both , but _ that _ would be exercise only to my body , and I must take care of my mind . Besides , _ that _ would be all recreation and indulgence , without the wholesome alloy of labour , and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness . No , my plan is to make Fanny Price in love with me . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Fanny Price ! Nonsense ! No , no . You ought to be satisfied with her two cousins . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	But I can not be satisfied without Fanny Price , without making a small hole in Fanny Price ’s heart . You do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice . When we talked of her last night , you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks . You see her every day , and therefore do not notice it ; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn . She was then merely a quiet , modest , not plain - looking girl , but she is now absolutely pretty . I used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance ; but in that soft skin of hers , so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday , there is decided beauty ; and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth , I do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express . And then , her air , her manner , her _ tout _ _ ensemble _ , is so indescribably improved ! She must be grown two inches , at least , since October . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Phoo ! phoo ! This is only because there were no tall women to compare her with , and because she has got a new gown , and you never saw her so well dressed before . She is just what she was in October , believe me . The truth is , that she was the only girl in company for you to notice , and you must have a somebody . I have always thought her pretty — not strikingly pretty — but ‘ pretty enough , ’ as people say ; a sort of beauty that grows on one . Her eyes should be darker , but she has a sweet smile ; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement , I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress , and your having nobody else to look at ; and therefore , if you do set about a flirtation with her , you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty , or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny . I do not understand her . I could not tell what she would be at yesterday . What is her character ? Is she solemn ? Is she queer ? Is she prudish ? Why did she draw back and look so grave at me ? I could hardly get her to speak . I never was so long in company with a girl in my life , trying to entertain her , and succeed so ill ! Never met with a girl who looked so grave on me ! I must try to get the better of this . Her looks say , ‘ I will not like you , I am determined not to like you ’ ; and I say she shall . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Foolish fellow ! And so this is her attraction after all ! This it is , her not caring about you , which gives her such a soft skin , and makes her so much taller , and produces all these charms and graces ! I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy ; a _ little _ love , perhaps , may animate and do her good , but I will not have you plunge her deep , for she is as good a little creature as ever lived , and has a great deal of feeling . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	It can be but for a fortnight , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	and if a fortnight can kill her , she must have a constitution which nothing could save . No , I will not do her any harm , dear little soul ! I only want her to look kindly on me , to give me smiles as well as blushes , to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are , and be all animation when I take it and talk to her ; to think as I think , be interested in all my possessions and pleasures , try to keep me longer at Mansfield , and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again . I want nothing more . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I can have no scruples now . Well , you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself , for we are a great deal together . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	dear , yes ! very entertaining indeed . A very odd game . I do not know what it is all about . I am never to see my cards ; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	, ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home . ” They
Sir Thomas Bertram	told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew - trees , because I can never bear to ask ; but I have not told you that , with my usual luck — for I never do wrong without gaining by it — I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see . I was suddenly , upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field , in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills ; a small stream before me to be forded , a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right — which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place , and not a gentleman or half a gentleman ’s house to be seen excepting one — to be presumed the Parsonage — within a stone ’s throw of the said knoll and church . I found myself , in short , in Thornton Lacey . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	sounds like it , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	which way did you turn after passing Sewell ’s farm ? ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions ; though were I to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour , you would never be able to prove that it was _ not _ Thornton Lacey — for such it certainly was . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	inquired , then ? ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	, I never inquire . But I _ told _ a man mending a hedge that it was Thornton Lacey , and he agreed to it . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	have a good memory . I had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place . ” Thornton
Sir Thomas Bertram	, ” continued
Sir Thomas Bertram	how did you like what you saw ? ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	much indeed . You are a lucky fellow . There will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	, no , not so bad as that . The farmyard must be moved , I grant you ; but I am not aware of anything else . The house is by no means bad , and when the yard is removed , there may be a very tolerable approach to it . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	farmyard must be cleared away entirely , and planted up to shut out the blacksmith ’s shop . The house must be turned to front the east instead of the north — the entrance and principal rooms , I mean , must be on that side , where the view is really very pretty ; I am sure it may be done . And _ there _ must be your approach , through what is at present the garden . You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house ; which will be giving it the best aspect in the world , sloping to the south - east . The ground seems precisely formed for it . I rode fifty yards up the lane , between the church and the house , in order to look about me ; and saw how it might all be . Nothing can be easier . The meadows beyond what _ will _ _ be _ the garden , as well as what now _ is _ , sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north - east , that is , to the principal road through the village , must be all laid together , of course ; very pretty meadows they are , finely sprinkled with timber . They belong to the living , I suppose ; if not , you must purchase them . Then the stream — something must be done with the stream ; but I could not quite determine what . I had two or three ideas . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	I have two or three ideas also , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	one of them is , that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in practice . I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty . I think the house and premises may be made comfortable , and given the air of a gentleman ’s residence , without any very heavy expense , and that must suffice me ; and , I hope , may suffice all who care about me . ” Miss
Sir Thomas Bertram	plan may not be the best possible : I had not many minutes to form it in ; but you must do a good deal . The place deserves it , and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of . ( Excuse me , your ladyship must not see your cards . There , let them lie just before you . ) The place deserves it , Bertram . You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman ’s residence . _ That _ will be done by the removal of the farmyard ; for , independent of that terrible nuisance , I never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman ’s residence , so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage - house — above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year . It is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms , with as many roofs as windows ; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse : it is a solid , roomy , mansion - like looking house , such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation , through two centuries at least , and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in . ” Miss
Sir Thomas Bertram	Bertram , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	know Henry to be such a capital improver , that you can not possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help . Only think how useful he was at Sotherton ! Only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to drive about the grounds , and see his genius take fire . There we went , and there we came home again ; and what was done there is not to be told ! ” Fanny
Sir Thomas Bertram	should be sorry to have my powers of _ planning _ judged of by the day at Sotherton . I see things very differently now . Do not think of me as I appeared then . ” Sotherton
Sir Thomas Bertram	should be very happy , aunt ; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head ; and if I could get so far , I could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that — poor scrubby midshipman as I am . ” Mrs.
Sir Thomas Bertram	do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than anything else , ” was
Sir Thomas Bertram	want to be your neighbour , Sir Thomas , as you have , perhaps , heard me telling Miss Price . May I hope for your acquiescence , and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant ? ” Sir
Sir Thomas Bertram	is the only way , sir , in which I could _ not _ wish you established as a permanent neighbour ; but I hope , and believe , that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey . Edmund , am I saying too much ? ” Edmund
Sir Thomas Bertram	, sir , I have no idea but of residence . But , Crawford , though I refuse you as a tenant , come to me as a friend . Consider the house as half your own every winter , and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan , and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	repeat again , ” added
Sir Thomas Bertram	Thornton Lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which I should _ not _ be happy to wait on Mr. Crawford as occupier . ” Mr.
Sir Thomas Bertram	Thomas , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	understands the duty of a parish priest . We must hope his son may prove that _ he _ knows it too . ” Whatever
Sir Thomas Bertram	is the assembly night , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	I were at Portsmouth I should be at it , perhaps . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth , William ? ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	, Fanny , that I do not . I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of dancing too , when I can not have you . And I do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly , for I might not get a partner . The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission . One might as well be nothing as a midshipman . One _ is _ nothing , indeed . You remember the Gregorys ; they are grown up amazing fine girls , but they will hardly speak to _ me _ , because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant , Fanny . Everybody gets made but me . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	! my dear William , do not talk so ; do not be so desponding . My uncle says nothing , but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made . He knows , as well as you do , of what consequence it is . ” She
Sir Thomas Bertram	should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance . Have you never any balls at Northampton ? I should like to see you dance , and I ’d dance with you if you _ would _ , for nobody would know who I was here , and I should like to be your partner once more . We used to jump about together many a time , did not we ? when the hand - organ was in the street ? I am a pretty good dancer in my way , but I dare say you are a better . ” And
Sir Thomas Bertram	am sorry to say that I am unable to answer your question . I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl ; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her , which , perhaps , we may have an opportunity of doing ere long . ” “
Sir Thomas Bertram	have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance , Mr. Price , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject , to your entire satisfaction . But I believe ” (
Sir Thomas Bertram	, Fanny , Fanny , what are you about ? We are going . Do not you see your aunt is going ? Quick , quick ! I can not bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting . You should always remember the coachman and horses . My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ” Sir
Sir Thomas Bertram	Thomas , stop a moment — I have something to say to you . ” Her
Sir Thomas Bertram	will be late , ” said
Sir Thomas Bertram	what is your difficulty ? ” Edmund
Sir Thomas Bertram	Yes , sir ; to Mr. Crawford , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	It must be so , my dear , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I am worn out with civility , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	it is three o’clock , and your sister is not used to these sort of hours . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I must get up and breakfast with him . It will be the last time , you know ; the last morning . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	You had better not . He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half - past nine . Mr. Crawford , I think you call for him at half - past nine ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Advise ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	one moment and no more , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	” ;
Sir Thomas Bertram	Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did , for now the others are away we feel the good of it . ” Sir
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ There is a great deal of truth in what you say ,
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each . I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , let her home be in this house . We will endeavour to do our duty by her , and she will , at least , have the advantage of companions of her own age , and of a regular instructress .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Should her disposition be really bad ,
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ we must not , for our own children ’s sake , continue her in the family ; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil . We shall probably see much to wish altered in her , and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance , some meanness of opinions , and very distressing vulgarity of manner ; but these are not incurable faults ; nor , I trust , can they be dangerous for her associates . Had my daughters been _ younger _ than herself , I should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment ; but , as it is , I hope there can be nothing to fear for _ them _ , and everything to hope for _ her _ , from the association .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ There will be some difficulty in our way , Mrs. Norris ,
Sir Thomas Bertram	My daughters , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	have their pleasures at Brighton , and I hope are very happy ; but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins . Could we be all assembled , our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete , but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	there was , in fact , no trouble in the business . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I understand , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I understand . Your aunt Norris has always been an advocate , and very judiciously , for young people ’s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences ; but there should be moderation in everything . She is also very hardy herself , which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others . And on another account , too , I can perfectly comprehend . I know what her sentiments have always been . The principle was good in itself , but it may have been , and I believe _ has _ _ been _ , carried too far in your case . I am aware that there has been sometimes , in some points , a misplaced distinction ; but I think too well of you , Fanny , to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account . You have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part , and judging partially by the event . You will take in the whole of the past , you will consider times , persons , and probabilities , and you will feel that _ they _ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which _ seemed _ to be your lot . Though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary , it was kindly meant ; and of this you may be assured , that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been imposed . I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you , by failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and attention that are due to her . But enough of this . Sit down , my dear . I must speak to you for a few minutes , but I will not detain you long . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	And now , Fanny , having performed one part of my commission , and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory , I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs , where , though I can not but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself , I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to . Mr. Crawford , as you have perhaps foreseen , is yet in the house . He is in my room , and hoping to see you there . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I do not catch your meaning , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	You are mistaken , sir , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	you are quite mistaken . How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing ? I gave him no encouragement yesterday . On the contrary , I told him , I can not recollect my exact words , but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him , that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect , and that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again . I am sure I said as much as that and more ; and I should have said still more , if I had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously ; but I did not like to be , I could not bear to be , imputing more than might be intended . I thought it might all pass for nothing with _ him _ . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Am I to understand , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	that you mean to _ refuse _ Mr. Crawford ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	This is very strange ! ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Yes , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	You must have been aware , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	you must have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford ’s manners to you . This can not have taken you by surprise . You must have observed his attentions ; and though you always received them very properly ( I have no accusation to make on that head ) , I never perceived them to be unpleasant to you . I am half inclined to think , Fanny , that you do not quite know your own feelings . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	No , no , I know _ that _ is quite out of the question ; quite impossible . Well , there is nothing more to be said . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me . I am an advocate for early marriages , where there are means in proportion , and would have every young man , with a sufficient income , settle as soon after four - and - twenty as he can . This is so much my opinion , that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son , your cousin , Mr. Bertram , is to marry early ; but at present , as far as I can judge , matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts . I wish he were more likely to fix . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Yes , sir . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	No , sir . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	It is of no use , I perceive , to talk to you . We had better put an end to this most mortifying conference . Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting . I will , therefore , only add , as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct , that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed , and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed . For I _ had _ , Fanny , as I think my behaviour must have shewn , formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to England . I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper , self - conceit , and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days , even in young women , and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence . But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice . You have shewn yourself very , very different from anything that I had imagined . The advantage or disadvantage of your family , of your parents , your brothers and sisters , never seems to have had a moment ’s share in your thoughts on this occasion . How _ they _ might be benefited , how _ they _ must rejoice in such an establishment for you , is nothing to _ you _ . You think only of yourself , and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again . Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford ’s estate , or a tenth part of his merits . Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him . Maria is nobly married ; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia ’s hand , I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria ’s to Mr. Rushworth . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Crawford is gone : he has just left me . I need not repeat what has passed . I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling , by an account of what he has felt . Suffice it , that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner , and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding , heart , and temper . Upon my representation of what you were suffering , he immediately , and with the greatest delicacy , ceased to urge to see you for the present . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Of course , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	it can not be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone , be it only for five minutes ; a request too natural , a claim too just to be denied . But there is no time fixed ; perhaps to - morrow , or whenever your spirits are composed enough . For the present you have only to tranquillise yourself . Check these tears ; they do but exhaust you . If , as I am willing to suppose , you wish to shew me any observance , you will not give way to these emotions , but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind . I advise you to go out : the air will do you good ; go out for an hour on the gravel ; you will have the shrubbery to yourself , and will be the better for air and exercise . And , Fanny ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	, Fanny , I have seen Mr. Crawford again , and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you . He is a most extraordinary young man , and whatever be the event , you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character ; though , young as you are , and little acquainted with the transient , varying , unsteady nature of love , as it generally exists , you can not be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement . With him it is entirely a matter of feeling : he claims no merit in it ; perhaps is entitled to none . Yet , having chosen so well , his constancy has a respectable stamp . Had his choice been less unexceptionable , I should have condemned his persevering . ” “
William Price	Yes , Mary , ”
William Price	I could not get away sooner ; Fanny looked so lovely ! I am quite determined , Mary . My mind is entirely made up . Will it astonish you ? No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ”
William Price	Yes , Mary , ”
William Price	I am fairly caught . You know with what idle designs I began ; but this is the end of them . I have , I flatter myself , made no inconsiderable progress in her affections ; but my own are entirely fixed . ”
William Price	When Fanny is known to him , ”
William Price	he will doat on her . She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral , for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world . She is the very impossibility he would describe , if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas . But till it is absolutely settled — settled beyond all interference , he shall know nothing of the matter . No , Mary , you are quite mistaken . You have not discovered my business yet . ”
William Price	Well , well , I am satisfied . I know now to whom it must relate , and am in no hurry for the rest . Fanny Price ! wonderful , quite wonderful ! That Mansfield should have done so much for — that _ you _ should have found your fate in Mansfield ! But you are quite right ; you could not have chosen better . There is not a better girl in the world , and you do not want for fortune ; and as to her connexions , they are more than good . The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country . She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram ; that will be enough for the world . But go on , go on . Tell me more . What are your plans ? Does she know her own happiness ? ”
William Price	No . ”
William Price	What are you waiting for ? ”
William Price	For — for very little more than opportunity . Mary , she is not like her cousins ; but I think I shall not ask in vain . ”
William Price	Oh no ! you can not . Were you even less pleasing — supposing her not to love you already ( of which , however , I can have little doubt)—you would be safe . The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately . From my soul I do not think she would marry you _ without _ love ; that is , if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition , I can suppose it her ; but ask her to love you , and she will never have the heart to refuse . ”
William Price	I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her , ”
William Price	and _ that _ is what I want . ”
William Price	The more I think of it , ”
William Price	the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy . Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed . You will both find your good in it . ”
William Price	It was bad , very bad in me against such a creature ; but I did not know her then ; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head . I will make her very happy , Mary ; happier than she has ever yet been herself , or ever seen anybody else . I will not take her from Northamptonshire . I shall let Everingham , and rent a place in this neighbourhood ; perhaps Stanwix Lodge . I shall let a seven years ’ lease of Everingham . I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word . I could name three people now , who would give me my own terms and thank me . ”
William Price	You must give us more than half your time , ”
William Price	I can not admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself , for we shall both have a right in you . Fanny will be so truly your sister ! ”
William Price	You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire ? ”
William Price	Yes . ”
William Price	That ’s right ; and in London , of course , a house of your own : no longer with the Admiral . My dearest Henry , the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his , before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions , or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life ! _ You _ are not sensible of the gain , for your regard for him has blinded you ; but , in my estimation , your marrying early may be the saving of you . To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed , look or gesture , would have broken my heart . ”
William Price	Well , well , we do not think quite alike here . The Admiral has his faults , but he is a very good man , and has been more than a father to me . Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much . You must not prejudice Fanny against him . I must have them love one another . ”
William Price	Henry , I think so highly of Fanny Price , that if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill - used aunt had to abhor the very name , I would prevent the marriage , if possible ; but I know you : I know that a wife you _ loved _ would be the happiest of women , and that even when you ceased to love , she would yet find in you the liberality and good - breeding of a gentleman . ”
William Price	Had you seen her this morning , Mary , ”
William Price	attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt ’s stupidity , working with her , and for her , her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work , then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman ’s service , and all this with such unpretending gentleness , so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command , her hair arranged as neatly as it always is , and one little curl falling forward as she wrote , which she now and then shook back , and in the midst of all this , still speaking at intervals to _ me _ , or listening , and as if she liked to listen , to what I said . Had you seen her so , Mary , you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing . ”
William Price	I care neither what they say nor what they feel . They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me , that can attach a man of sense . I wish the discovery may do them any good . And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be , and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness . They will be angry , ”
William Price	Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry . It will be a bitter pill to her ; that is , like other bitter pills , it will have two moments ’ ill flavour , and then be swallowed and forgotten ; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women ’s , though _ I _ was the object of them . Yes , Mary , my Fanny will feel a difference indeed : a daily , hourly difference , in the behaviour of every being who approaches her ; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it , that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due . Now she is dependent , helpless , friendless , neglected , forgotten . ”
William Price	Nay , Henry , not by all ; not forgotten by all ; not friendless or forgotten . Her cousin Edmund never forgets her . ”
William Price	Edmund ! True , I believe he is , generally speaking , kind to her , and so is Sir Thomas in his way ; but it is the way of a rich , superior , long - worded , arbitrary uncle . What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do , what _ do _ they do for her happiness , comfort , honour , and dignity in the world , to what I _ shall _ do ? ”
William Price	heaven ! how very , very kind ! Have you really — was it by _ your _ desire ? I beg your pardon , but I am bewildered . Did Admiral Crawford apply ? How was it ? I am stupefied . ” Henry
William Price	kind ! how very kind ! Oh , Mr. Crawford , we are infinitely obliged to you ! Dearest , dearest William ! ” She
William Price	do not know how it is , ” said
William Price	we seem to want some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father ’s . The house is always in confusion . You will set things going in a better way , I am sure . You will tell my mother how it all ought to be , and you will be so useful to Susan , and you will teach Betsey , and make the boys love and mind you . How right and comfortable it will all be ! ” By
William Price	That play must be a favourite with you , ”
William Price	you read as if you knew it well . ”
William Price	It will be a favourite , I believe , from this hour , ”
William Price	but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen . I once saw Henry the Eighth acted , or I have heard of it from somebody who did , I am not certain which . But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how . It is a part of an Englishman ’s constitution . His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere ; one is intimate with him by instinct . No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately . ”
William Price	William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ” She
William Price	Do you know , I begin to like that queer fashion already , though when I first heard of such things being done in England , I could not believe it ; and when Mrs. Brown , and the other women at the Commissioner ’s at Gibraltar , appeared in the same trim , I thought they were mad ; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything ”
William Price	, I will stake my last like a woman of spirit . No cold prudence for me . I am not born to sit still and do nothing . If I lose the game , it shall not be from not striving for it . ” The
William Price	shall be the losers , ” continued
William Price	going , though only eight miles , will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle ; but I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less . It is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject , Mr. Crawford . But a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident , and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent . Edmund might , in the common phrase , do the duty of Thornton , that is , he might read prayers and preach , without giving up Mansfield Park : he might ride over every Sunday , to a house nominally inhabited , and go through divine service ; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day , for three or four hours , if that would content him . But it will not . He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey ; and that if he does not live among his parishioners , and prove himself , by constant attention , their well - wisher and friend , he does very little either for their good or his own . ” Mr.
William Price	not Fanny a very good dancer , sir ? ” Fanny
William Price	Poor Fanny ! ”
William Price	how soon she is knocked up ! Why , the sport is but just begun . I hope we shall keep it up these two hours . How can you be tired so soon ? ”
William Price	Ha ! ”
William Price	_ that ’s _ just where I should have put her myself . It ’s the best berth at Spithead . But here is my sister , sir ; here is Fanny , ”
William Price	I do not like , William , that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence . It would give me pleasure to see you both dance . You spoke of the balls at Northampton . Your cousins have occasionally attended them ; but they would not altogether suit us now . The fatigue would be too much for your aunt . I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball . A dance at home would be more eligible ; and if — ”
Edmund Bertram	It is to his credit , ”
Edmund Bertram	and I dare say it gives his sister pleasure . She does not like his unsettled habits . ”
Edmund Bertram	loves a play better than you do , or can have gone much farther to see one . ” “
Edmund Bertram	Jove ! this wo n’t do , ” cried
Edmund Bertram	be sure , my dear mother , your anxiety — I was unlucky there . ” “
Edmund Bertram	dear , no , ma’am , nobody suspected you ! Well , Edmund , ” he
Edmund Bertram	was a very different thing . You must see the difference yourself . My father wished us , as schoolboys , to speak well , but he would never wish his grown - up daughters to be acting plays . His sense of decorum is strict . ” “
Edmund Bertram	you are resolved on acting , ” replied
Edmund Bertram	must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way ; and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted . It would be taking liberties with my father ’s house in his absence which could not be justified . ” “
Edmund Bertram	innovation , if not wrong as an innovation , will be wrong as an expense . ” “
Edmund Bertram	, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious ! Perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds . Something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly , but it will be on the simplest plan : a green curtain and a little carpenter ’s work , and that ’s all ; and as the carpenter ’s work may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself , it will be too absurd to talk of expense ; and as long as Jackson is employed , everything will be right with Sir Thomas . Do n’t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself . Do n’t act yourself , if you do not like it , but do n’t expect to govern everybody else . ” “
Edmund Bertram	, as to acting myself , ” said
Edmund Bertram	that _ I absolutely protest against . ” Tom
Edmund Bertram	should think my aunt Norris would be on your side . ” “
Edmund Bertram	dare say she would , but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use ; and if I can not convince them myself , I shall let things take their course , without attempting it through her . Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all , and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears . ” His
Edmund Bertram	say you now ? Can we be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same ? ” And
Edmund Bertram	her friend , ”
Edmund Bertram	Miss Price has a brother at sea , ”
Edmund Bertram	whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us . ”
Edmund Bertram	Do you know anything of my cousin ’s captain ? ”
Edmund Bertram	Captain Marshall ? You have a large acquaintance in the navy , I conclude ? ”
Edmund Bertram	Among admirals , large enough ; but , ”
Edmund Bertram	Excessively ; but what with the natural advantages of the ground , which pointed out , even to a very young eye , what little remained to be done , and my own consequent resolutions , I had not been of age three months before Everingham was all that it is now . My plan was laid at Westminster , a little altered , perhaps , at Cambridge , and at one - and - twenty executed . I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him . I have been a devourer of my own . ”
Edmund Bertram	_ You _ can never want employment . Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth , you should assist him with your opinion . ”
Edmund Bertram	right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill - humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse . She is perfectly feminine , except in the instances we have been speaking of . There she can not be justified . I am glad you saw it all as I did . ” Having
Edmund Bertram	, I do not know — not if you want the mare , ” was
Edmund Bertram	do not want her at all for myself , ” said
Edmund Bertram	whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time — for a whole morning , in short . She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . But any morning will do for this . She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you . It would be very wrong if she did . _ She _ rides only for pleasure ; _ you _ for health . ” “
Edmund Bertram	where is Fanny ? Is she gone to bed ? ” “
Edmund Bertram	can hardly believe you , ” he
Edmund Bertram	There is no hardship , I suppose , nothing unpleasant , ”
Edmund Bertram	in going on the barouche box . ”
Edmund Bertram	Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires , ”
Edmund Bertram	there he is ”
Edmund Bertram	lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects . You have given us an amusing sketch , and human nature can not say it was not so . We must all feel _ at _ _ times _ the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish ; but if you are supposing it a frequent thing , that is to say , a weakness grown into a habit from neglect , what could be expected from the _ private _ devotions of such persons ? Do you think the minds which are suffered , which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel , would be more collected in a closet ? ” “
Edmund Bertram	, ” said
Edmund Bertram	believe the wilderness will be new to all the party . The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet . ” No
Edmund Bertram	half a mile , ” was
Edmund Bertram	have been exactly a quarter of an hour here , ” said
Edmund Bertram	! do not attack me with your watch . A watch is always too fast or too slow . I can not be dictated to by a watch . ” A
Edmund Bertram	would not you speak sooner ? This will be a bad day ’s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up . Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon , Miss Crawford , except riding . ” “
Edmund Bertram	abominable in you , then , to let me engross her horse as I did all last week ! I am ashamed of you and of myself , but it shall never happen again . ” “
Edmund Bertram	Your _ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect . Fanny ’s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me . ” “
Edmund Bertram	she should be tired now , however , gives me no surprise ; for there is nothing in the course of one ’s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning : seeing a great house , dawdling from one room to another , straining one ’s eyes and one ’s attention , hearing what one does not understand , admiring what one does not care for . It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world , and Miss Price has found it so , though she did not know it . ” “
Edmund Bertram	Fanny has been reading to me , and only put the book down upon hearing you coming . ”
Edmund Bertram	No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree , ”
Edmund Bertram	from one ’s earliest years . His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody ; they are in half the books we open , and we all talk Shakespeare , use his similes , and describe with his descriptions ; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it . To know him in bits and scraps is common enough ; to know him pretty thoroughly is , perhaps , not uncommon ; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent . ”
Edmund Bertram	That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham . ”
Edmund Bertram	Even in my profession , ”
Edmund Bertram	how little the art of reading has been studied ! how little a clear manner , and good delivery , have been attended to ! I speak rather of the past , however , than the present . There is now a spirit of improvement abroad ; but among those who were ordained twenty , thirty , forty years ago , the larger number , to judge by their performance , must have thought reading was reading , and preaching was preaching . It is different now . The subject is more justly considered . It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths ; and besides , there is more general observation and taste , a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly ; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter , and who can judge and criticise . ”
Edmund Bertram	am come to walk with you , Fanny , ” said
Edmund Bertram	far your conduct has been faultless , and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise . But the matter does not end here . Crawford ’s is no common attachment ; he perseveres , with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before . This , we know , must be a work of time . But ” (
Edmund Bertram	! Fanny!—so very determined and positive ! This is not like yourself , your rational self . ” “
Edmund Bertram	! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia ; but I could never see anything of it . And , Fanny , though I hope I do justice to my sisters ’ good qualities , I think it very possible that they might , one or both , be more desirous of being admired by Crawford , and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent . I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society ; and with such encouragement , a man like Crawford , lively , and it may be , a little unthinking , might be led on to — there could be nothing very striking , because it is clear that he had no pretensions : his heart was reserved for you . And I must say , that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion . It does him the highest honour ; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment . It proves him unspoilt by his uncle . It proves him , in short , everything that I had been used to wish to believe him , and feared he was not . ” “
Edmund Bertram	usual , believing yourself unequal to anything ! fancying everything too much for you ! Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust . I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may . I have no common interest in Crawford ’s well - doing . Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me . You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford . ” Fanny
Edmund Bertram	was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light . I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune . I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear . But it was very different . She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought . She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself . We had a long talk about it . I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself . Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ” “
Edmund Bertram	Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ” “
Edmund Bertram	, when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in . ” “
Edmund Bertram	is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . ” “
Edmund Bertram	, she laments it ; yet owns it may have been best . You will see her , however , before she goes . She is very angry with you , Fanny ; you must be prepared for that . She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger . It is the regret and disappointment of a sister , who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for , at the first moment . She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart . ” “
Edmund Bertram	Mrs. Grant , did she say — did she speak ; was she there all the time ? ” “
Edmund Bertram	, she was agreeing exactly with her sister . The surprise of your refusal , Fanny , seems to have been unbounded . That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand . I said what I could for you ; but in good truth , as they stated the case — you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct ; nothing else will satisfy them . But this is teasing you . I have done . Do not turn away from me . ” “
Edmund Bertram	Perhaps I might have scolded , ”
Edmund Bertram	if either of you had been sitting down alone ; but while you do wrong together , I can overlook a great deal . ”
Edmund Bertram	You intend to be very rich ? ”
Edmund Bertram	, ” said
Edmund Bertram	wants her to go . But how can I spare her ? ” “
Edmund Bertram	were unlucky , Miss Price , ” he
Edmund Bertram	certainly were very unlucky . Another week , only one other week , would have been enough for us . I think if we had had the disposal of events — if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two , about the equinox , there would have been a difference . Not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather — but only by a steady contrary wind , or a calm . I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week ’s calm in the Atlantic at that season . ” He
Edmund Bertram	Fanny must have a horse , ”
Edmund Bertram	believe I know what you mean , but I will not undertake to answer the question . My cousin is grown up . She has the age and sense of a woman , but the outs and not outs are beyond me . ” “
Edmund Bertram	, ” replied
Edmund Bertram	do not think she has ever been to a ball . My mother seldom goes into company herself , and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant , and Fanny stays at home with _ her _ . ” “
Edmund Bertram	! then the point is clear . Miss Price is not out . ”
Edmund Bertram	My Fanny , my only sister ; my only comfort now ! ”
Edmund Bertram	will tell you everything , and then have done for ever . She saw it only as folly , and that folly stamped only by exposure . The want of common discretion , of caution : his going down to Richmond for the whole time of her being at Twickenham ; her putting herself in the power of a servant ; it was the detection , in short — oh , Fanny ! it was the detection , not the offence , which she reprobated . It was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity , and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her . ” He
Edmund Bertram	, nothing to be understood . I was like a man stunned . She went on , began to talk of you ; yes , then she began to talk of you , regretting , as well she might , the loss of such a—. There she spoke very rationally . But she has always done justice to you . ‘ He has thrown away , ’ said she , ‘ such a woman as he will never see again . She would have fixed him ; she would have made him happy for ever . ’ My dearest Fanny , I am giving you , I hope , more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been — but what never can be now . You do not wish me to be silent ? If you do , give me but a look , a word , and I have done . ” No
Edmund Bertram	! ” said
Edmund Bertram	cruel . At such a moment to give way to gaiety , to speak with lightness , and to you ! Absolute cruelty . ” “
Edmund Bertram	, do you call it ? We differ there . No , hers is not a cruel nature . I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings . The evil lies yet deeper : in her total ignorance , unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings ; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did . She was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak , as she imagined everybody else would speak . Hers are not faults of temper . She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one , and though I may deceive myself , I can not but think that for me , for my feelings , she would—. Hers are faults of principle , Fanny ; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted , vitiated mind . Perhaps it is best for me , since it leaves me so little to regret . Not so , however . Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her , rather than have to think of her as I do . I told her so . ” “
Edmund Bertram	you ? ” “
Edmund Bertram	; when I left her I told her so . ” “
Edmund Bertram	long were you together ? ” “
Edmund Bertram	- and - twenty minutes . Well , she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them . She spoke of it , Fanny , with a steadier voice than I can . ” He
Edmund Bertram	We must persuade Henry to marry her , ’ said she ; ‘ and what with honour , and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from Fanny , I do not despair of it . Fanny he must give up . I do not think that even _ he _ could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp , and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty . My influence , which is not small shall all go that way ; and when once married , and properly supported by her own family , people of respectability as they are , she may recover her footing in society to a certain degree . In some circles , we know , she would never be admitted , but with good dinners , and large parties , there will always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance ; and there is , undoubtedly , more liberality and candour on those points than formerly . What I advise is , that your father be quiet . Do not let him injure his own cause by interference . Persuade him to let things take their course . If by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave Henry ’s protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him . I know how he is likely to be influenced . Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion , and it may all end well ; but if he get his daughter away , it will be destroying the chief hold . ’ ” After
Edmund Bertram	, Fanny , ” said
Edmund Bertram	shall soon have done . I have told you the substance of all that she said . As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it . That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now . And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . She was astonished , exceedingly astonished — more than astonished . I saw her change countenance . She turned extremely red . I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it . She would have laughed if she could . It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , ‘ A pretty good lecture , upon my word . Was it part of your last sermon ? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . ’ She tried to speak carelessly , but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . ‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she . I looked back . ‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! Equally in brother and sister deceived ! I thank you for your patience , Fanny . This has been the greatest relief , and now we will have done . ” And
Edmund Bertram	come in three times , and have two - and - forty speeches . That ’s something , is not it ? But I do not much like the idea of being so fine . I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak . ” Edmund
Edmund Bertram	Yes , ”
Edmund Bertram	No . ”
Edmund Bertram	! cousin , stop a moment , pray stop ! ” He
Edmund Bertram	dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much . I am most happy that you like the chain , and that it should be here in time for to - morrow ; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion . Believe me , I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours . No , I can safely say , I have no pleasure so complete , so unalloyed . It is without a drawback . ” Upon
Edmund Bertram	the two dearest objects I have on earth . ” He
Edmund Bertram	come from Dr. Grant ’s , ” said
Edmund Bertram	wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , ” was
Edmund Bertram	effect of education , ” said
Edmund Bertram	, that uncle and aunt ! They have injured the finest mind ; for sometimes , Fanny , I own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted . ” Fanny
Edmund Bertram	Can I speak with you , Fanny , for a few minutes ? ”
Edmund Bertram	I want to consult . I want your opinion . ”
Edmund Bertram	I shall walk down immediately after breakfast , ”
Edmund Bertram	and am sure of giving pleasure there . And now , dear Fanny , I will not interrupt you any longer . You want to be reading . But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you , and come to a decision . Sleeping or waking , my head has been full of this matter all night . It is an evil , but I am certainly making it less than it might be . If Tom is up , I shall go to him directly and get it over , and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good - humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity . _ You _ , in the meanwhile , will be taking a trip into China , I suppose . How does Lord Macartney go on?”—opening a volume on the table and then taking up some others . “ And here are Crabbe ’s Tales , and the Idler , at hand to relieve you , if you tire of your great book . I admire your little establishment exceedingly ; and as soon as I am gone , you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting , and sit comfortably down to your table . But do not stay here to be cold . ”
Edmund Bertram	was certainly right in respecting such feelings ; he was glad he had determined on it . ” And
Maria Bertram	If I had not been active , ”
Maria Bertram	and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle . But I left no stone unturned . I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister , and at last I did persuade her . You know the distance to Sotherton ; it was in the middle of winter , and the roads almost impassable , but I did persuade her . ”
Maria Bertram	Whose stables do you use at Bath ? ”
Maria Bertram	And I do believe she can say every word of it , ”
Maria Bertram	for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places . Fanny , I am sure you know the part . ”
Maria Bertram	is too good for him — much too good . ” And
Maria Bertram	what do you do for women ? ” said
Maria Bertram	see things very differently , ” cried
Maria Bertram	am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and _ I _ am not the _ only _ young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . ” “
Maria Bertram	am sorry for it , ” was
Maria Bertram	in this matter it is _ you _ who are to lead . _ You _ must set the example . If others have blundered , it is your place to put them right , and shew them what true delicacy is . In all points of decorum _ your _ conduct must be law to the rest of the party . ” This
Maria Bertram	am much obliged to you , Edmund ; you mean very well , I am sure : but I still think you see things too strongly ; and I really can not undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind . _ There _ would be the greatest indecorum , I think . ” “
Maria Bertram	you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head ? No ; let your conduct be the only harangue . Say that , on examining the part , you feel yourself unequal to it ; that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have . Say this with firmness , and it will be quite enough . All who can distinguish will understand your motive . The play will be given up , and your delicacy honoured as it ought . ” “
Maria Bertram	! she might think the difference between us — the difference in our situations — that _ she _ need not be so scrupulous as _ I _ might feel necessary . I am sure she would argue so . No ; you must excuse me ; I can not retract my consent ; it is too far settled , everybody would be so disappointed , Tom would be quite angry ; and if we are so very nice , we shall never act anything . ” “
Maria Bertram	Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . ”
Julia Bertram	What ! ”
Julia Bertram	go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather , when we may have seats in a barouche ! No , my dear Edmund , that will not quite do . ”
Julia Bertram	Besides , ”
Julia Bertram	I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us . After what passed at first , he would claim it as a promise . ”
Julia Bertram	That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford ’s , ”
Julia Bertram	but the truth is , that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow , and does not know how to drive . I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday . ”
Julia Bertram	Unpleasant ! ”
Julia Bertram	oh dear ! I believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat . There can be no comparison as to one ’s view of the country . Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche - box herself . ”
Julia Bertram	There can be no objection , then , to Fanny ’s going with you ; there can be no doubt of your having room for her . ”
Julia Bertram	It seems very odd , ”
Julia Bertram	that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . ”
Julia Bertram	I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , ”
Julia Bertram	am afraid I should do it very awkwardly , ” was
Julia Bertram	my word , it is really a pity that it should not take place directly , if we had but a proper licence , for here we are altogether , and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant . ” And
Julia Bertram	was , in fact , the origin of _ our _ acting , ” said
Julia Bertram	friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford , and it spread — as those things always spread , you know , sir — the faster , probably , from _ your _ having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly . It was like treading old ground again . ” Mr.
Julia Bertram	Here are not women enough . Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me , but here is nothing for your sister , Mr. Crawford . ”
Julia Bertram	What are you talking of ? The most trivial , paltry , insignificant part ; the merest commonplace ; not a tolerable speech in the whole . Your sister do that ! It is an insult to propose it . At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it . We all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else . A little more justice , Mr. Manager , if you please . You do not deserve the office , if you can not appreciate the talents of your company a little better . ”
Julia Bertram	Why , as to _ that _ , my good friend , till I and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork ; but I mean no disparagement to Julia . We can not have two Agathas , and we must have one Cottager ’s wife ; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old Butler . If the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it ; and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous , let her take Cottager ’s speeches instead of Cottager ’s wife ’s , and so change the parts all through ; _ he _ is solemn and pathetic enough , I am sure . It could make no difference in the play , and as for Cottager himself , when he has got his wife ’s speeches , _ I _ would undertake him with all my heart . ”
Julia Bertram	No , no , Julia must not be Amelia . It is not at all the part for her . She would not like it . She would not do well . She is too tall and robust . Amelia should be a small , light , girlish , skipping figure . It is fit for Miss Crawford , and Miss Crawford only . She looks the part , and I am persuaded will do it admirably . ”
Julia Bertram	You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket of provisions — though one might have supposed — but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering ! ”
Julia Bertram	Do not be afraid of _ my _ wanting the character , ”
Julia Bertram	I am _ not _ to be Agatha , and I am sure I will do nothing else ; and as to Amelia , it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me . I quite detest her . An odious , little , pert , unnatural , impudent girl . I have always protested against comedy , and this is comedy in its worst form . ”
Julia Bertram	have got a play , ” said
Julia Bertram	is to be Lovers ’ Vows ; and I am to be Count Cassel , and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak , and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit , by way of a shooting - dress . I do not know how I shall like it . ” Fanny
Julia Bertram	, ” cried
Julia Bertram	take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ” (
Julia Bertram	Crawford is to be Amelia . ” “
Julia Bertram	should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ” replied
Julia Bertram	not act anything improper , my dear , ” said
Julia Bertram	was just going to say the very same thing , ” said
Julia Bertram	What else have you been spunging ? ”
Julia Bertram	rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , ” was
Mary Crawford	Lucky , lucky girl ! ”
Mary Crawford	what a match for her ! My dearest Henry , this must be my _ first _ feeling ; but my _ second _ , which you shall have as sincerely , is , that I approve your choice from my soul , and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it . You will have a sweet little wife ; all gratitude and devotion . Exactly what you deserve . What an amazing match for her ! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck ; what will she say now ? The delight of all the family , indeed ! And she has some _ true _ friends in it ! How _ they _ will rejoice ! But tell me all about it ! Talk to me for ever . When did you begin to think seriously about her ? ”
Mary Crawford	How the pleasing plague had stolen on him ”
Mary Crawford	Ah , my dear Henry , and this is what took you to London ! This was your business ! You chose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind . ”
Mary Crawford	Ha ! ”
Mary Crawford	settle in Northamptonshire ! That is pleasant ! Then we shall be all together . ”
Mary Crawford	My dearest Henry , ”
Mary Crawford	how glad I am to see you so much in love ! It quite delights me . But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say ? ”
Mary Crawford	will not talk of my own happiness , ” said
Mary Crawford	as it is , for I think only of yours . Compared with you , who has a right to be happy ? I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world . I have not lost a moment , however . The post was late this morning , but there has not been since a moment ’s delay . How impatient , how anxious , how wild I have been on the subject , I will not attempt to describe ; how severely mortified , how cruelly disappointed , in not having it finished while I was in London ! I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it , for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from Mansfield . But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire , and exerted himself immediately , there were difficulties from the absence of one friend , and the engagements of another , which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of , and knowing in what good hands I left the cause , I came away on Monday , trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by such very letters as these . My uncle , who is the very best man in the world , has exerted himself , as I knew he would , after seeing your brother . He was delighted with him . I would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted , or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his praise . I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend , as this day _ does _ prove it . _ Now _ I may say that even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest , or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation , than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together . ” “
Mary Crawford	this been all _ your _ doing , then ? ” cried
Mary Crawford	I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , ”
Mary Crawford	than when he had succeeded in getting your brother ’s commission . ”
Mary Crawford	Oh ! yes . How very , very kind of him . ”
Mary Crawford	The fatigue would be too much for my sister , a great deal too much , I assure you , my dear Mrs. Rushworth . Ten miles there , and ten back , you know . You must excuse my sister on this occasion , and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her . Sotherton is the only place that could give her a _ wish _ to go so far , but it can not be , indeed . She will have a companion in Fanny Price , you know , so it will all do very well ; and as for Edmund , as he is not here to speak for himself , I will answer for his being most happy to join the party . He can go on horseback , you know . ”
Mary Crawford	The loss of her ladyship ’s company would be a great drawback , and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too , Miss Price , who had never been at Sotherton yet , and it was a pity she should not see the place . ”
Mary Crawford	Oh no ! I can not do without Fanny . ”
Mary Crawford	To be sure not , but I _ can not _ do without her . ”
Mary Crawford	You can , if I stay at home with you , as I mean to do . ”
Mary Crawford	Oh yes ! very glad , if your aunt sees no objection . ”
Mary Crawford	her view of the country was charming , she wished they could all see it , ”
Mary Crawford	Here is a fine burst of country . I wish you had my seat , but I dare say you will not take it , let me press you ever so much ; ”
Mary Crawford	those woods belonged to Sotherton , ”
Mary Crawford	she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth ’s property on each side of the road , ”
Mary Crawford	Now we shall have no more rough road , Miss Crawford ; our difficulties are over . The rest of the way is such as it ought to be . Mr. Rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate . Here begins the village . Those cottages are really a disgrace . The church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome . I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places . The annoyance of the bells must be terrible . There is the parsonage : a tidy - looking house , and I understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people . Those are almshouses , built by some of the family . To the right is the steward ’s house ; he is a very respectable man . Now we are coming to the lodge - gates ; but we have nearly a mile through the park still . It is not ugly , you see , at this end ; there is some fine timber , but the situation of the house is dreadful . We go down hill to it for half a mile , and it is a pity , for it would not be an ill - looking place if it had a better approach . ”
Mary Crawford	it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ”
Mary Crawford	Now , where is the avenue ? The house fronts the east , I perceive . The avenue , therefore , must be at the back of it . Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front . ”
Mary Crawford	Yes , it is exactly behind the house ; begins at a little distance , and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds . You may see something of it here — something of the more distant trees . It is oak entirely . ”
Mary Crawford	be depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments , might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure . ” Mrs.
Mary Crawford	, ” said
Mary Crawford	are coming to the chapel , which properly we ought to enter from above , and look down upon ; but as we are quite among friends , I will take you in this way , if you will excuse me . ” They
Mary Crawford	is not my idea of a chapel . There is nothing awful here , nothing melancholy , nothing grand . Here are no aisles , no arches , no inscriptions , no banners . No banners , cousin , to be ‘ blown by the night wind of heaven . ’ No signs that a ‘ Scottish monarch sleeps below . ’ ” “
Mary Crawford	forget , Fanny , how lately all this has been built , and for how confined a purpose , compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries . It was only for the private use of the family . They have been buried , I suppose , in the parish church . _ There _ you must look for the banners and the achievements . ” “
Mary Crawford	was foolish of me not to think of all that ; but I am disappointed . ” Mrs.
Mary Crawford	generation has its improvements , ” said
Mary Crawford	is a pity , ” cried
Mary Crawford	the custom should have been discontinued . It was a valuable part of former times . There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house , with one ’s ideas of what such a household should be ! A whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine ! ” “
Mary Crawford	fine indeed , ” said
Mary Crawford	must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure , and say their prayers here twice a day , while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away . ” “
Mary Crawford	That _ is hardly Fanny ’s idea of a family assembling , ” said
Mary Crawford	the master and mistress do _ not _ attend themselves , there must be more harm than good in the custom . ” “
Mary Crawford	any rate , it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects . Everybody likes to go their own way — to chuse their own time and manner of devotion . The obligation of attendance , the formality , the restraint , the length of time — altogether it is a formidable thing , and what nobody likes ; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed , when they woke with a headache , without danger of reprobation , because chapel was missed , they would have jumped with joy and envy . Can not you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel ? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets — starched up into seeming piety , but with heads full of something very different — especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at — and , in those days , I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now . ” For
Mary Crawford	, very likely . They would have two chances at least in their favour . There would be less to distract the attention from without , and it would not be tried so long . ” “
Mary Crawford	mind which does not struggle against itself under _ one _ circumstance , would find objects to distract it in the _ other _ , I believe ; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with . The greater length of the service , however , I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind . One wishes it were not so ; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are . ” While
Mary Crawford	do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar . ” Starting
Mary Crawford	he would give her away ? ” “
Mary Crawford	Edmund were but in orders ! ” cried
Mary Crawford	dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly . How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ” Miss
Mary Crawford	distressed she will be at what she said just now , ” passed
Mary Crawford	! ” said
Mary Crawford	, are you to be a clergyman ? ” “
Mary Crawford	; I shall take orders soon after my father ’s return — probably at Christmas . ” Miss
Mary Crawford	if , ” said
Mary Crawford	are _ too _ long going over the house , we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors . It is past two , and we are to dine at five . ” Mrs.
Mary Crawford	we turn down here for the present , ” said
Mary Crawford	are the greatest number of our plants , and here are the curious pheasants . ” “
Mary Crawford	, ” said
Mary Crawford	we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther ? I see walls of great promise . Mr. Rushworth , shall we summon a council on this lawn ? ” “
Mary Crawford	any of us object to being comfortable ? Here is a nice little wood , if one can but get into it . What happiness if the door should not be locked ! but of course it is ; for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like . ” The
Mary Crawford	you are to be a clergyman , Mr. Bertram . This is rather a surprise to me . ” “
Mary Crawford	should it surprise you ? You must suppose me designed for some profession , and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer , nor a soldier , nor a sailor . ” “
Mary Crawford	true ; but , in short , it had not occurred to me . And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son . ” “
Mary Crawford	very praiseworthy practice , ” said
Mary Crawford	not quite universal . I am one of the exceptions , and _ being _ one , must do something for myself . ” “
Mary Crawford	why are you to be a clergyman ? I thought _ that _ was always the lot of the youngest , where there were many to chuse before him . ” “
Mary Crawford	you think the church itself never chosen , then ? ” “
Mary Crawford	Never _ is a black word . But yes , in the _ never _ of conversation , which means _ not _ _ very _ _ often _ , I do think it . For what is to be done in the church ? Men love to distinguish themselves , and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained , but not in the church . A clergyman is nothing . ” “
Mary Crawford	_ nothing _ of conversation has its gradations , I hope , as well as the _ never _ . A clergyman can not be high in state or fashion . He must not head mobs , or set the ton in dress . But I can not call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind , individually or collectively considered , temporally and eternally , which has the guardianship of religion and morals , and consequently of the manners which result from their influence . No one here can call the _ office _ nothing . If the man who holds it is so , it is by the neglect of his duty , by foregoing its just importance , and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear . ” “
Mary Crawford	You _ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given , or than I can quite comprehend . One does not see much of this influence and importance in society , and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves ? How can two sermons a week , even supposing them worth hearing , supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair ’s to his own , do all that you speak of ? govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week ? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit . ” “
Mary Crawford	You _ are speaking of London , _ I _ am speaking of the nation at large . ” “
Mary Crawford	metropolis , I imagine , is a pretty fair sample of the rest . ” “
Mary Crawford	, I should hope , of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom . We do not look in great cities for our best morality . It is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good ; and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt . A fine preacher is followed and admired ; but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood , where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character , and observing his general conduct , which in London can rarely be the case . The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners . They are known to the largest part only as preachers . And with regard to their influencing public manners , Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me , or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good - breeding , the regulators of refinement and courtesy , the masters of the ceremonies of life . The _ manners _ I speak of might rather be called _ conduct _ , perhaps , the result of good principles ; the effect , in short , of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend ; and it will , I believe , be everywhere found , that as the clergy are , or are not what they ought to be , so are the rest of the nation . ” “
Mary Crawford	wish I could convince Miss Crawford too . ” “
Mary Crawford	do not think you ever will , ” said
Mary Crawford	am just as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take orders . You really are fit for something better . Come , do change your mind . It is not too late . Go into the law . ” “
Mary Crawford	into the law ! With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness . ” “
Mary Crawford	you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two , but I forestall you ; remember , I have forestalled you . ” “
Mary Crawford	need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a _ bon _ _ mot _ , for there is not the least wit in my nature . I am a very matter - of - fact , plain - spoken being , and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out . ” A
Mary Crawford	other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm . ” “
Mary Crawford	you , but I am not at all tired . ” She
Mary Crawford	scarcely touch me , ” said
Mary Crawford	do not make me of any use . What a difference in the weight of a woman ’s arm from that of a man ! At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street , and you are only a fly in the comparison . ” “
Mary Crawford	am really not tired , which I almost wonder at ; for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood . Do not you think we have ? ” “
Mary Crawford	! you do not consider how much we have wound about . We have taken such a very serpentine course , and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line , for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path . ” “
Mary Crawford	if you remember , before we left that first great path , we saw directly to the end of it . We looked down the whole vista , and saw it closed by iron gates , and it could not have been more than a furlong in length . ” “
Mary Crawford	! I know nothing of your furlongs , but I am sure it is a very long wood , and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it ; and therefore , when I say that we have walked a mile in it , I must speak within compass . ” “
Mary Crawford	you think we are walking four miles an hour ? ” “
Mary Crawford	must move , ” said
Mary Crawford	fatigues me . I have looked across the ha - ha till I am weary . I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view , without being able to see it so well . ” Edmund
Mary Crawford	is an immense distance , ” said
Mary Crawford	see _ that _ with a glance . ” He
Mary Crawford	And now that I have begun , ”
Mary Crawford	my letter will not be worth your reading , for there will be no little offering of love at the end , no three or four lines _ passionnées _ from the most devoted H. C. in the world , for Henry is in Norfolk ; business called him to Everingham ten days ago , or perhaps he only pretended the call , for the sake of being travelling at the same time that you were . But there he is , and , by the bye , his absence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister ’s in writing , for there has been no ‘ Well , Mary , when do you write to Fanny ? Is not it time for you to write to Fanny ? ’ to spur me on . At last , after various attempts at meeting , I have seen your cousins , ‘ dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth ’ ; they found me at home yesterday , and we were glad to see each other again . We _ seemed _ _ very _ glad to see each other , and I do really think we were a little . We had a vast deal to say . Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned ? I did not use to think her wanting in self - possession , but she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday . Upon the whole , Julia was in the best looks of the two , at least after you were spoken of . There was no recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of ‘ Fanny , ’ and spoke of her as a sister should . But Mrs. Rushworth ’s day of good looks will come ; we have cards for her first party on the 28th . Then she will be in beauty , for she will open one of the best houses in Wimpole Street . I was in it two years ago , when it was Lady Lascelle ’s , and prefer it to almost any I know in London , and certainly she will then feel , to use a vulgar phrase , that she has got her pennyworth for her penny . Henry could not have afforded her such a house . I hope she will recollect it , and be satisfied , as well as she may , with moving the queen of a palace , though the king may appear best in the background ; and as I have no desire to tease her , I shall never _ force _ your name upon her again . She will grow sober by degrees . From all that I hear and guess , Baron Wildenheim ’s attentions to Julia continue , but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement . She ought to do better . A poor honourable is no catch , and I can not imagine any liking in the case , for take away his rants , and the poor baron has nothing . What a difference a vowel makes ! If his rents were but equal to his rants ! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly ; detained , perchance , by parish duties . There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted . I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _ young _ one . Adieu ! my dear sweet Fanny , this is a long letter from London : write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry ’s eyes , when he comes back , and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake . ”
Mary Crawford	airs ”
Mary Crawford	Moderation itself ! ”
Mary Crawford	Another quarter of an hour , ”
Mary Crawford	and we shall see how it will be . Do not run away the first moment of its holding up . Those clouds look alarming . ”
Mary Crawford	If any one faculty of our nature may be called _ more _ wonderful than the rest , I do think it is memory . There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers , the failures , the inequalities of memory , than in any other of our intelligences . The memory is sometimes so retentive , so serviceable , so obedient ; at others , so bewildered and so weak ; and at others again , so tyrannic , so beyond control ! We are , to be sure , a miracle every way ; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out . ”
Mary Crawford	Yes , ”
Mary Crawford	it does very well for a place of this sort . One does not think of extent _ here _ ; and between ourselves , till I came to Mansfield , I had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery , or anything of the kind . ”
Mary Crawford	To say the truth , ”
Mary Crawford	I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV . ; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it . If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home , that I should be spending month after month here , as I have done , I certainly should not have believed them . I have now been here nearly five months ; and , moreover , the quietest five months I ever passed . ”
Mary Crawford	I should have thought so _ theoretically _ myself , but , ”
Mary Crawford	take it all and all , I never spent so happy a summer . But then , ”
Mary Crawford	there is no saying what it may lead to . ”
Mary Crawford	I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be . I can even suppose it pleasant to spend _ half _ the year in the country , under certain circumstances , very pleasant . An elegant , moderate - sized house in the centre of family connexions ; continual engagements among them ; commanding the first society in the neighbourhood ; looked up to , perhaps , as leading it even more than those of larger fortune , and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a _ tête - à - tête _ with the person one feels most agreeable in the world . There is nothing frightful in such a picture , is there , Miss Price ? One need not envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _ that _ . ”
Mary Crawford	Ah ! here he is . ”
Mary Crawford	My sister and Mr. Bertram . I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone , that he may be Mr. Bertram again . There is something in the sound of Mr. _ Edmund _ Bertram so formal , so pitiful , so younger - brother - like , that I detest it . ”
Mary Crawford	Well , ”
Mary Crawford	and do you not scold us for our imprudence ? What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it , and entreated and supplicated never to do so again ? ”
Mary Crawford	Upon my word , ”
Mary Crawford	you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with ! There is no giving you a moment ’s uneasiness . You do not know how much we have been suffering , nor what chills we have felt ! But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on , in any little manoeuvre against common sense , that a woman could be plagued with . I had very little hope of _ him _ from the first ; but you , Mrs. Grant , my sister , my own sister , I think I had a right to alarm you a little . ”
Mary Crawford	The sweets of housekeeping in a country village ! ”
Mary Crawford	My dear child , commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul ’s , and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be . But we have no such people in Mansfield . What would you have me do ? ”
Mary Crawford	Thank you ; but there is no escaping these little vexations , Mary , live where we may ; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you , I dare say I shall find you with yours , in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer , perhaps on their very account . Their remoteness and unpunctuality , or their exorbitant charges and frauds , will be drawing forth bitter lamentations . ”
Mary Crawford	I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort . A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of . It certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it . ”
Mary Crawford	To be sure . Do not you ? Do not we all ? ”
Mary Crawford	I can not intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command . Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth . She has only to fix on her number of thousands a year , and there can be no doubt of their coming . My intentions are only not to be poor . ”
Mary Crawford	By moderation and economy , and bringing down your wants to your income , and all that . I understand you — and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life , with such limited means and indifferent connexions . What can _ you _ want but a decent maintenance ? You have not much time before you ; and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you , or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence . Be honest and poor , by all means — but I shall not envy you ; I do not much think I shall even respect you . I have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich . ”
Mary Crawford	Your degree of respect for honesty , rich or poor , is precisely what I have no manner of concern with . I do not mean to be poor . Poverty is exactly what I have determined against . Honesty , in the something between , in the middle state of worldly circumstances , is all that I am anxious for your not looking down on . ”
Mary Crawford	Oh ! ”
Mary Crawford	You ought to be in parliament , or you should have gone into the army ten years ago . ”
Mary Crawford	_ That _ is not much to the purpose now ; and as to my being in parliament , I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on . No , Miss Crawford , ”
Mary Crawford	were Mr. Rushworth ’s best friend . Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten , your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part — in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied — to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own ! _ He _ might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness , but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party . ” Fanny
Mary Crawford	is as a dream , a pleasant dream ! ” he
Mary Crawford	shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure . There was such an interest , such an animation , such a spirit diffused . Everybody felt it . We were all alive . There was employment , hope , solicitude , bustle , for every hour of the day . Always some little objection , some little doubt , some little anxiety to be got over . I never was happier . ” With
Mary Crawford	he not feel this ? ” thought
Mary Crawford	because , ”
Mary Crawford	she might ride one of her cousin ’s horses at any time when they did not want them , ”
Mary Crawford	My dear sister , ”
Mary Crawford	if you can persuade him into anything of the sort , it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever , and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of . If you can persuade Henry to marry , you must have the address of a Frenchwoman . All that English abilities can do has been tried already . I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn ; and the pains which they , their mothers ( very clever women ) , as well as my dear aunt and myself , have taken to reason , coax , or trick him into marrying , is inconceivable ! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined . If your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke , let them avoid Henry . ”
Mary Crawford	could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man — everybody knew her situation — Mr. Crawford must take care of himself . ” Mr.
Mary Crawford	, _ that _ is very inconvenient indeed , ” said
Mary Crawford	Dear Fanny ! now I shall be comfortable . ”
Mary Crawford	This is not behaving well by the absent , ”
Mary Crawford	I must entreat Miss _ Julia _ Bertram , ”
Mary Crawford	not to engage in the part of Agatha , or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity . You must not , indeed you must not ”
Mary Crawford	I could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness . The many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me , and Frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away . ”
Mary Crawford	With all your partiality for Cottager ’s wife , ”
Mary Crawford	it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister , and we must not suffer her good - nature to be imposed on . We must not _ allow _ her to accept the part . She must not be left to her own complaisance . Her talents will be wanted in Amelia . Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha . I consider Amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece . It requires great powers , great nicety , to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance . I have seen good actresses fail in the part . Simplicity , indeed , is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession . It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not . It requires a gentlewoman — a Julia Bertram . You _ will _ undertake it , I hope ? ”
Mary Crawford	You must oblige us , ”
Mary Crawford	indeed you must . When you have studied the character , I am sure you will feel it suit you . Tragedy may be your choice , but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _ you _ . You will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions ; you will not refuse to visit me in prison ? I think I see you coming in with your basket . ”
Mary Crawford	must really congratulate your ladyship , ” said
Mary Crawford	the play being chosen ; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience , I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties . The actors may be glad , but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision ; and I do sincerely give you joy , madam , as well as Mrs. Norris , and everybody else who is in the same predicament , ” glancing
Mary Crawford	Rushworth was to be Count Cassel , but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt . ” “
Mary Crawford	had my choice of the parts , ” said
Mary Crawford	I thought I should like the Count best , though I do not much relish the finery I am to have . ” “
Mary Crawford	chose very wisely , I am sure , ” replied
Mary Crawford	is a heavy part . ” “
Mary Crawford	The _ _ Count _ has two - and - forty speeches , ” returned
Mary Crawford	is no trifle . ” “
Mary Crawford	am not at all surprised , ” said
Mary Crawford	this want of an Anhalt . Amelia deserves no better . Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men . ” “
Mary Crawford	should be but too happy in taking the part , if it were possible , ” cried
Mary Crawford	, unluckily , the Butler and Anhalt are in together . I will not entirely give it up , however ; I will try what can be done — I will look it over again . ” “
Mary Crawford	_ brother _ should take the part , ” said
Mary Crawford	not you think he would ? ” “
Mary Crawford	I _ shall not ask him , ” replied
Mary Crawford	only puzzle them , and oblige them to make civil speeches . Mr. Edmund Bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and , therefore , I apply to _ you _ . What shall we do for an Anhalt ? Is it practicable for any of the others to double it ? What is your advice ? ” “
Mary Crawford	advice , ” said
Mary Crawford	that you change the play . ” “
Mary Crawford	I _ should have no objection , ” she
Mary Crawford	though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ ” (
Mary Crawford	certainly will not be taken . ” Edmund
Mary Crawford	_ any _ part could tempt _ you _ to act , I suppose it would be Anhalt , ” observed
Mary Crawford	he is a clergyman , you know . ” “
Mary Crawford	That _ circumstance would by no means tempt me , ” he
Mary Crawford	I should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting . It must be very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal , solemn lecturer ; and the man who chuses the profession itself is , perhaps , one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage . ” Miss
Mary Crawford	! ” cried
Mary Crawford	you must excuse me . I could not act anything if you were to give me the world . No , indeed , I can not act . ” “
Mary Crawford	would you do with such a part as mine ? I have forty - two to learn . ” “
Mary Crawford	, yes , you can act well enough for _ us _ . Learn your part , and we will teach you all the rest . You have only two scenes , and as I shall be Cottager , I ’ll put you in and push you about , and you will do it very well , I ’ll answer for it . ” “
Mary Crawford	! Phoo ! Do not be so shamefaced . You ’ll do it very well . Every allowance will be made for you . We do not expect perfection . You must get a brown gown , and a white apron , and a mob cap , and we must make you a few wrinkles , and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes , and you will be a very proper , little old woman . ” “
Mary Crawford	not urge her , madam , ” said
Mary Crawford	is not fair to urge her in this manner . You see she does not like to act . Let her chuse for herself , as well as the rest of us . Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted . Do not urge her any more . ” “
Mary Crawford	am not going to urge her , ” replied
Mary Crawford	I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is . ” Edmund
Mary Crawford	do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ” and
Mary Crawford	mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ” ;
Mary Crawford	there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it , ” he
Mary Crawford	have but to speak the word ; we may pick and chuse . I could name , at this moment , at least six young men within six miles of us , who are wild to be admitted into our company , and there are one or two that would not disgrace us : I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox . Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow , and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere , so I will take my horse early to - morrow morning and ride over to Stoke , and settle with one of them . ” While
Mary Crawford	far as I am concerned , I can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible . Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen ? Yes , Mr. Charles Maddox dined at my sister ’s one day , did not he , Henry ? A quiet - looking young man . I remember him . Let _ him _ be applied to , if you please , for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger . ” Charles
Mary Crawford	am not very sanguine as to our play , ” said
Mary Crawford	I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of _ his _ speeches , and a great many of _ my _ _ own _ , before we rehearse together . It will be very disagreeable , and by no means what I expected . ”
Mary Crawford	Ah , my dear Sir Thomas ! ”
Mary Crawford	I knew what was coming . I knew what you were going to say . If dear Julia were at home , or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton , to afford a reason , an occasion for such a thing , you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield . I know you would . If _ they _ were at home to grace the ball , a ball you would have this very Christmas . Thank your uncle , William , thank your uncle ! ”
Mary Crawford	very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ” locked
Mary Crawford	, ” he
Mary Crawford	is engaged to me ; but ” (
Mary Crawford	says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me . She is not serious . I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it . She never has danced with a clergyman , she says , and she never _ will _ . For my own sake , I could wish there had been no ball just at — I mean not this very week , this very day ; to - morrow I leave home . ” Fanny
Mary Crawford	dare say she is , ” replied
Mary Crawford	imagine both sisters are . ” “
Mary Crawford	! no , no , that must not be . Do not give him a hint of it . Think of Mr. Rushworth ! ” “
Mrs. Rushworth	Sir Thomas know ” to
Susan Price	have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect . This , as well as I understand , is to be the substance of my information . He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love . I have not time for writing much , but it would be out of place if I had , for this is to be a mere letter of business , penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information , which could not be delayed without risk of evil . My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you ! You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . I have no news for you . You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time . I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin ’s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long ago ; suffice it , that everything was just as it ought to be , in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness , and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit . My friend , Mrs. Fraser , is mad for such a house , and it would not make _ me _ miserable . I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter ; she seems in high spirits , and very happy . I fancy Lord S. is very good - humoured and pleasant in his own family , and I do not think him so very ill - looking as I did — at least , one sees many worse . He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund . Of the last - mentioned hero , what shall I say ? If I avoided his name entirely , it would look suspicious . I will say , then , that we have seen him two or three times , and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance . Mrs. Fraser ( no bad judge ) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person , height , and air ; and I must confess , when he dined here the other day , there were none to compare with him , and we were a party of sixteen . Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales , but — but — but Yours affectionately . ” “
Mrs. Price	’s friend , ” though
Mrs. Price	was a lovely morning , and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off , that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise ” ;
Mrs. Price	The Thrush is gone out of harbour , please sir , and one of the officers has been here to — ”
Mrs. Price	To be sure , I had much rather she had stayed in harbour , that I might have sat a few hours with you in comfort ; but as there is a boat ashore , I had better go off at once , and there is no help for it . Whereabouts does the Thrush lay at Spithead ? Near the Canopus ? But no matter ; here ’s Fanny in the parlour , and why should we stay in the passage ? Come , mother , you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet . ”
Mrs. Price	Dear me ! ”
Mrs. Price	what a sad fire we have got , and I dare say you are both starved with cold . Draw your chair nearer , my dear . I can not think what Rebecca has been about . I am sure I told her to bring some coals half an hour ago . Susan , you should have taken care of the fire . ”
Mrs. Price	Devil take those young dogs ! How they are singing out ! Ay , Sam ’s voice louder than all the rest ! That boy is fit for a boatswain . Holla , you there ! Sam , stop your confounded pipe , or I shall be after you . ”
Mrs. Price	I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November . Servants are come to such a pass , my dear , in Portsmouth , that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year . I have no hope of ever being settled ; and if I was to part with Rebecca , I should only get something worse . And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please ; and I am sure the place is easy enough , for there is always a girl under her , and I often do half the work myself . ”
Mrs. Price	Now , Susan , ”
Mrs. Price	now , how can you be so cross ? You are always quarrelling about that knife . I wish you would not be so quarrelsome . Poor little Betsey ; how cross Susan is to you ! But you should not have taken it out , my dear , when I sent you to the drawer . You know I told you not to touch it , because Susan is so cross about it . I must hide it another time , Betsey . Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep , only two hours before she died . Poor little soul ! she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , ‘ Let sister Susan have my knife , mama , when I am dead and buried . ’ Poor little dear ! she was so fond of it , Fanny , that she would have it lay by her in bed , all through her illness . It was the gift of her good godmother , old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell , only six weeks before she was taken for death . Poor little sweet creature ! Well , she was taken away from evil to come . My own Betsey ”
Lady Bertram	He is just come , my dear Fanny , and is taken upstairs ; and I am so shocked to see him , that I do not know what to do . I am sure he has been very ill . Poor Tom ! I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me . But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to - morrow , and says we must consider his journey . ”
Lady Bertram	My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble . ”
Lady Bertram	me , my dear Fanny , as soon as you can , for my long silence , and behave as if you could forgive me directly . This is my modest request and expectation , for you are so good , that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve , and I write now to beg an immediate answer . I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park , and you , no doubt , are perfectly able to give it . One should be a brute not to feel for the distress they are in ; and from what I hear , poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery . I thought little of his illness at first . I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with , and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder , and was chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him ; but now it is confidently asserted that he is really in a decline , that the symptoms are most alarming , and that part of the family , at least , are aware of it . If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed . I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake , but the report is so prevalent that I confess I can not help trembling . To have such a fine young man cut off in the flower of his days is most melancholy . Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully . I really am quite agitated on the subject . Fanny , Fanny , I see you smile and look cunning , but , upon my honour , I never bribed a physician in my life . Poor young man ! If he is to die , there will be _ two _ poor young men less in the world ; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one , that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of them . It was a foolish precipitation last Christmas , but the evil of a few days may be blotted out in part . Varnish and gilding hide many stains . It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name . With real affection , Fanny , like mine , more might be overlooked . Write to me by return of post , judge of my anxiety , and do not trifle with it . Tell me the real truth , as you have it from the fountainhead . And now , do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own . Believe me , they are not only natural , they are philanthropic and virtuous . I put it to your conscience , whether ‘ Sir Edmund ’ would not do more good with all the Bertram property than any other possible ‘ Sir . ’ Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you , but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth , his sisters not being within my reach . Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham ( as to be sure you know ) , and is not yet returned ; and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square , but I forget their name and street . Could I immediately apply to either , however , I should still prefer you , because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up , as to shut their eyes to the truth . I suppose Mrs. R. ’s Easter holidays will not last much longer ; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her . The Aylmers are pleasant people ; and her husband away , she can have nothing but enjoyment . I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to Bath , to fetch his mother ; but how will she and the dowager agree in one house ? Henry is not at hand , so I have nothing to say from him . Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago , but for this illness?—Yours ever , Mary . ” “
Lady Bertram	We have not been so silent all the time , ”
Lady Bertram	One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _ should _ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too . What is the play about , Fanny ? you have never told me . ”
Lady Bertram	I believe , ”
Lady Bertram	there will be three acts rehearsed to - morrow evening , and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once . ”
Lady Bertram	Fanny was good - natured enough . ”
Lady Bertram	to leave you ? ” “
Lady Bertram	what did he say ? He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny . I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it . ” “
Lady Bertram	could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her ; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . ” And
Lady Bertram	can not think what is the matter with me , ” said
Lady Bertram	feel quite stupid . It must be sitting up so late last night . Fanny , you must do something to keep me awake . I can not work . Fetch the cards ; I feel so very stupid . ” The
Mrs. Grant	is the matter ? ” asked
Mrs. Grant	was not asleep . ” “
Mrs. Grant	can not agree with you ; I am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it . ” “
Mrs. Grant	No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present , ”
Mrs. Grant	but depend upon it , Sotherton will have _ every _ improvement in time which his heart can desire . ”
Mrs. Grant	I must try to do something with it , ”
Mrs. Grant	but I do not know what . I hope I shall have some good friend to help me . ”
Mrs. Grant	The tree thrives well , beyond a doubt , madam , ”
Mrs. Grant	You were imposed on , ma’am , ”
Mrs. Grant	these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree . It is an insipid fruit at the best ; but a good apricot is eatable , which none from my garden are . ”
Mrs. Grant	The truth is , ma’am , ”
Mrs. Grant	that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is : he is scarcely ever indulged with one , for it is so valuable a fruit ; with a little assistance , and ours is such a remarkably large , fair sort , that what with early tarts and preserves , my cook contrives to get them all . ”
Mrs. Grant	_ should _ have thought , ” said
Mrs. Grant	Fanny must have a horse ”
Mrs. Grant	And now , ”
Mrs. Grant	I have thought of something to make it complete . I should dearly love to settle you both in this country ; and therefore , Henry , you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram , a nice , handsome , good - humoured , accomplished girl , who will make you very happy . ”
Mrs. Grant	My dear brother , I will not believe this of you . ”
Mrs. Grant	No , I am sure you are too good . You will be kinder than Mary . You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience . I am of a cautious temper , and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry . Nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself . I consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet—‘Heaven ’s _ last _ best gift . ’ ”
Mrs. Grant	There , Mrs. Grant , you see how he dwells on one word , and only look at his smile . I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral ’s lessons have quite spoiled him . ”
Mrs. Grant	I pay very little regard , ”
Mrs. Grant	to what any young person says on the subject of marriage . If they profess a disinclination for it , I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person . ”
Mrs. Grant	Oh yes ! I am not at all ashamed of it . I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly : I do not like to have people throw themselves away ; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage . ”
Mrs. Grant	they are indeed , and I am delighted to hear you say it . But you like Julia best . ” “
Mrs. Grant	yes ! I like Julia best . ” “
Mrs. Grant	do you really ? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the handsomest . ” “
Mrs. Grant	I should suppose . She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me . ” “
Mrs. Grant	shall not talk to you , Henry , but I know you _ will _ like her best at last . ” “
Mrs. Grant	not I tell you that I like her best _ at _ _ first _ ? ” “
Mrs. Grant	besides , Miss Bertram is engaged . Remember that , my dear brother . Her choice is made . ” “
Mrs. Grant	, and I like her the better for it . An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged . She is satisfied with herself . Her cares are over , and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion . All is safe with a lady engaged : no harm can be done . ” “
Mrs. Grant	, as to that , Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man , and it is a great match for her . ” “
Mrs. Grant	Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him ; _ that _ is your opinion of your intimate friend . _ I _ do not subscribe to it . I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth . I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned . I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart . ” “
Mrs. Grant	, how shall we manage him ? ” “
Mrs. Grant	must leave him to himself , I believe . Talking does no good . He will be taken in at last . ” “
Mrs. Grant	I would not have him _ taken _ _ in _ ; I would not have him duped ; I would have it all fair and honourable . ” “
Mrs. Grant	dear ! let him stand his chance and be taken in . It will do just as well . Everybody is taken in at some period or other . ” “
Mrs. Grant	always in marriage , dear Mary . ” “
Mrs. Grant	marriage especially . With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married , my dear Mrs. Grant , there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry . Look where I will , I see that it _ is _ so ; and I feel that it _ must _ be so , when I consider that it is , of all transactions , the one in which people expect most from others , and are least honest themselves . ” “
Mrs. Grant	! You have been in a bad school for matrimony , in Hill Street . ” “
Mrs. Grant	poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state ; but , however , speaking from my own observation , it is a manoeuvring business . I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion , or accomplishment , or good quality in the person , who have found themselves entirely deceived , and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse . What is this but a take in ? ” “
Mrs. Grant	dear child , there must be a little imagination here . I beg your pardon , but I can not quite believe you . Depend upon it , you see but half . You see the evil , but you do not see the consolation . There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere , and we are all apt to expect too much ; but then , if one scheme of happiness fails , human nature turns to another ; if the first calculation is wrong , we make a second better : we find comfort somewhere — and those evil - minded observers , dearest Mary , who make much of a little , are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves . ” “
Mrs. Grant	done , sister ! I honour your _ esprit _ _ du _ _ corps _ . When I am a wife , I mean to be just as staunch myself ; and I wish my friends in general would be so too . It would save me many a heartache . ” “
Mrs. Grant	begin now to understand you all , except Miss Price , ” said
Mrs. Grant	, is she out , or is she not ? I am puzzled . She dined at the Parsonage , with the rest of you , which seemed like being _ out _ ; and yet she says so little , that I can hardly suppose she _ is _ . ” Edmund
Mrs. Grant	a very pretty story it is , and with more truth in it , I dare say , than does credit to Miss Anderson . It is too common a fault . Mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters . I do not know where the error lies . I do not pretend to set people right , but I do see that they are often wrong . ” “
Mrs. Grant	yes ”
Mrs. Norris	I think , ma’am , ”
Mrs. Norris	we shall see some happy faces again now . ”
Mrs. Norris	It is quite delightful , ma’am , to see young people so properly happy , so well suited , and so much the thing ! I can not but think of dear Sir Thomas ’s delight . And what do you say , ma’am , to the chance of another match ? Mr. Rushworth has set a good example , and such things are very catching . ”
Mrs. Norris	my friend such a one . ”
Mrs. Norris	Oh , for shame ! ”
Mrs. Norris	A prison indeed ? Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world . ”
Mrs. Norris	It wants improvement , ma’am , beyond anything . I never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life ; and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done with it . ”
Mrs. Norris	Your best friend upon such an occasion , ”
Mrs. Norris	would be Mr. Repton , I imagine . ”
Mrs. Norris	That is what I was thinking of . As he has done so well by Smith , I think I had better have him at once . His terms are five guineas a day . ”
Mrs. Norris	Well , and if they were _ ten _ , ”
Mrs. Norris	I am sure _ you _ need not regard it . The expense need not be any impediment . If I were you , I should not think of the expense . I would have everything done in the best style , and made as nice as possible . Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that taste and money can do . You have space to work upon there , and grounds that will well reward you . For my own part , if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton , I should be always planting and improving , for naturally I am excessively fond of it . It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now , with my little half acre . It would be quite a burlesque . But if I had more room , I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting . We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage : we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it . You young ones do not remember much about it , perhaps ; but if dear Sir Thomas were here , he could tell you what improvements we made : and a great deal more would have been done , but for poor Mr. Norris ’s sad state of health . He could hardly ever get out , poor man , to enjoy anything , and _ that _ disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of . If it had not been for _ that _ , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as Dr. Grant has done . We were always doing something as it was . It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris ’s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall , which is now grown such a noble tree , and getting to such perfection , sir , ”
Mrs. Norris	Mr. Rushworth , ”
Mrs. Norris	if I were you , I would have a very pretty shrubbery . One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather . ”
Mrs. Norris	Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds , which is little enough , and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved . Now , at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred , without reckoning the water meadows ; so that I think , if so much could be done at Compton , we need not despair . There have been two or three fine old trees cut down , that grew too near the house , and it opens the prospect amazingly , which makes me think that Repton , or anybody of that sort , would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down : the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill , you know , ”
Mrs. Norris	The avenue ! Oh ! I do not recollect it . I really know very little of Sotherton . ”
Mrs. Norris	Cut down an avenue ! What a pity ! Does it not make you think of Cowper ? ‘ Ye fallen avenues , once more I mourn your fate unmerited . ’ ”
Mrs. Norris	I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down , to see the place as it is now , in its old state ; but I do not suppose I shall . ”
Mrs. Norris	Oh ! it does not signify . Whenever I do see it , you will tell me how it has been altered . ”
Mrs. Norris	I collect , ”
Mrs. Norris	that Sotherton is an old place , and a place of some grandeur . In any particular style of building ? ”
Mrs. Norris	The house was built in Elizabeth ’s time , and is a large , regular , brick building ; heavy , but respectable looking , and has many good rooms . It is ill placed . It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park ; in that respect , unfavourable for improvement . But the woods are fine , and there is a stream , which , I dare say , might be made a good deal of . Mr. Rushworth is quite right , I think , in meaning to give it a modern dress , and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well . ”
Mrs. Norris	He is a well - bred man ; he makes the best of it . ”
Mrs. Norris	I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth , ”
Mrs. Norris	but , had I a place to new fashion , I should not put myself into the hands of an improver . I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty , of my own choice , and acquired progressively . I would rather abide by my own blunders than by his . ”
Mrs. Norris	Ay , you have been brought up to it . It was no part of my education ; and the only dose I ever had , being administered by not the first favourite in the world , has made me consider improvements _ in _ _ hand _ as the greatest of nuisances . Three years ago the Admiral , my honoured uncle , bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in ; and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures ; but it being excessively pretty , it was soon found necessary to be improved , and for three months we were all dirt and confusion , without a gravel walk to step on , or a bench fit for use . I would have everything as complete as possible in the country , shrubberies and flower - gardens , and rustic seats innumerable : but it must all be done without my care . Henry is different ; he loves to be doing . ”
Mrs. Norris	Mr. Bertram , ”
Mrs. Norris	I have tidings of my harp at last . I am assured that it is safe at Northampton ; and there it has probably been these ten days , in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary . ”
Mrs. Norris	The truth is , that our inquiries were too direct ; we sent a servant , we went ourselves : this will not do seventy miles from London ; but this morning we heard of it in the right way . It was seen by some farmer , and he told the miller , and the miller told the butcher , and the butcher ’s son - in - law left word at the shop . ”
Mrs. Norris	I am very glad that you have heard of it , by whatever means , and hope there will be no further delay . ”
Mrs. Norris	I am to have it to - morrow ; but how do you think it is to be conveyed ? Not by a wagon or cart : oh no ! nothing of that kind could be hired in the village . I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow . ”
Mrs. Norris	You would find it difficult , I dare say , just now , in the middle of a very late hay harvest , to hire a horse and cart ? ”
Mrs. Norris	I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it ! To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible , so I told my maid to speak for one directly ; and as I can not look out of my dressing - closet without seeing one farmyard , nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another , I thought it would be only ask and have , and was rather grieved that I could not give the advantage to all . Guess my surprise , when I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable , most impossible thing in the world ; had offended all the farmers , all the labourers , all the hay in the parish ! As for Dr. Grant ’s bailiff , I believe I had better keep out of _ his _ way ; and my brother - in - law himself , who is all kindness in general , looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at . ”
Mrs. Norris	You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before ; but when you _ do _ think of it , you must see the importance of getting in the grass . The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose : our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out ; but , in harvest , it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse . ”
Mrs. Norris	I shall understand all your ways in time ; but , coming down with the true London maxim , that everything is to be got with money , I was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs . However , I am to have my harp fetched to - morrow . Henry , who is good - nature itself , has offered to fetch it in his barouche . Will it not be honourably conveyed ? ”
Mrs. Norris	I shall be most happy to play to you both , ”
Mrs. Norris	at least as long as you can like to listen : probably much longer , for I dearly love music myself , and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off , for she is gratified in more ways than one . Now , Mr. Bertram , if you write to your brother , I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come : he heard so much of my misery about it . And you may say , if you please , that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return , in compassion to his feelings , as I know his horse will lose . ”
Mrs. Norris	If I write , I will say whatever you wish me ; but I do not , at present , foresee any occasion for writing . ”
Mrs. Norris	No , I dare say , nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth , would you ever write to him , nor he to you , if it could be helped . The occasion would never be foreseen . What strange creatures brothers are ! You would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world ; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill , or such a relation dead , it is done in the fewest possible words . You have but one style among you . I know it perfectly . Henry , who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be , who loves me , consults me , confides in me , and will talk to me by the hour together , has never yet turned the page in a letter ; and very often it is nothing more than—‘Dear Mary , I am just arrived . Bath seems full , and everything as usual . Yours sincerely . ’ That is the true manly style ; that is a complete brother ’s letter . ”
Mrs. Norris	we know very little of the inferior ranks . Post - captains may be very good sort of men , but they do not belong to _ us _ . Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal : of them and their flags , and the gradation of their pay , and their bickerings and jealousies . But , in general , I can assure you that they are all passed over , and all very ill used . Certainly , my home at my uncle ’s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals . Of _ Rears _ and _ Vices _ I saw enough . Now do not be suspecting me of a pun , I entreat . ”
Mrs. Norris	It is a noble profession . ”
Mrs. Norris	Yes , the profession is well enough under two circumstances : if it make the fortune , and there be discretion in spending it ; but , in short , it is not a favourite profession of mine . It has never worn an amiable form to _ me _ . ”
Mrs. Norris	My dear Henry , have _ you _ nothing to say ? You have been an improver yourself , and from what I hear of Everingham , it may vie with any place in England . Its natural beauties , I am sure , are great . Everingham , as it _ used _ to be , was perfect in my estimation : such a happy fall of ground , and such timber ! What would I not give to see it again ! ”
Mrs. Norris	dear Miss Price , ” said
Mrs. Norris	am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me . Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure . ” Fanny
Mrs. Norris	there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , ” said
Mrs. Norris	you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then . I wish _ you _ may not be fatigued by so much exercise . I wish you had saved yourself this walk home . ” “
Mrs. Norris	part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , ” said
Mrs. Norris	am very strong . Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like . Miss Price , I give way to you with a very bad grace ; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride , and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear , delightful , beautiful animal . ” The
Mrs. Norris	, not that I know of , ” replied
Mrs. Norris	was here a moment ago . ” Her
Mrs. Norris	is a very foolish trick , Fanny , to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa . Why can not you come and sit here , and employ yourself as _ we _ do ? If you have no work of your own , I can supply you from the poor basket . There is all the new calico , that was bought last week , not touched yet . I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out . You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ” Before
Mrs. Norris	a little before dinner . It is nothing but the heat . ” “
Mrs. Norris	you go out in the heat ? ” “
Mrs. Norris	out ! to be sure she did , ” said
Mrs. Norris	you have her stay within such a fine day as this ? Were not we _ all _ out ? Even your mother was out to - day for above an hour . ” “
Mrs. Norris	, indeed , Edmund , ” added
Mrs. Norris	was out above an hour . I sat three - quarters of an hour in the flower - garden , while Fanny cut the roses ; and very pleasant it was , I assure you , but very hot . It was shady enough in the alcove , but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again . ” “
Mrs. Norris	was afraid it would be too much for her , ” said
Mrs. Norris	when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home . ” “
Mrs. Norris	am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody . It was as much as I could bear myself . Sitting and calling to Pug , and trying to keep him from the flower - beds , was almost too much for me . ” Edmund
Mrs. Norris	You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , ”
Mrs. Norris	but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . She has time enough before her ; and her going now is quite out of the question . Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her . ”
Mrs. Norris	And , my dear Edmund , ”
Mrs. Norris	taking out _ two _ carriages when _ one _ will do , would be trouble for nothing ; and , between ourselves , coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton : he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage , and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas , when he comes home , find all the varnish scratched off . ”
Mrs. Norris	Fanny ! ”
Mrs. Norris	my dear Edmund , there is no idea of her going with us . She stays with her aunt . I told Mrs. Rushworth so . She is not expected . ”
Mrs. Norris	Very well , very well , just as you chuse , settle it your own way , I am sure I do not care about it . ”
Mrs. Norris	This is not a very promising beginning , ”
Mrs. Norris	My dear little cousin , ”
Mrs. Norris	what can be the matter ? ”
Mrs. Norris	no , no — not at all — no , thank you ”
Mrs. Norris	You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ”
Mrs. Norris	which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . Let us walk out in the park , and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters . ”
Mrs. Norris	, Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . How shall you like it ? ” Fanny
Mrs. Norris	hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , ” said
Mrs. Norris	am I never to live here again ? ” “
Mrs. Norris	, ” said
Mrs. Norris	is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now . I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris . ” “
Mrs. Norris	! ” “
Mrs. Norris	! do not say so . ” “
Mrs. Norris	must say it , and say it with pleasure . Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now . She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . ” Fanny
Mrs. Norris	think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . ” Mrs.
Mrs. Norris	with me , dear Lady Bertram ! what do you mean ? ” “
Mrs. Norris	she not to live with you ? I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas . ” “
Mrs. Norris	! never . I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me . Fanny live with me ! the last thing in the world for me to think of , or for anybody to wish that really knows us both . Good heaven ! what could I do with Fanny ? Me ! a poor , helpless , forlorn widow , unfit for anything , my spirits quite broke down ; what could I do with a girl at her time of life ? A girl of fifteen ! the very age of all others to need most attention and care , and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test ! Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing ! Sir Thomas is too much my friend . Nobody that wishes me well , I am sure , would propose it . How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it ? ” “
Mrs. Norris	, you know , Sir Thomas ’s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns . ” “
Mrs. Norris	! _ that _ will soon be settled . Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know . ” “
Mrs. Norris	, Lady Bertram , ” said
Mrs. Norris	can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ; besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend . ” Lady
Mrs. Norris	loved plenty and hospitality more than herself ; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in _ her _ _ time _ , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand . A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place . _ Her _ store - room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into . Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds . ” Lady
Mrs. Norris	, at what time would you have the carriage come round ? ” she
Mrs. Norris	, sir , ” was
Mrs. Norris	unnecessary ! a great deal too kind ! But Edmund goes ; true , it is upon Edmund ’s account . I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night . ” But
Mrs. Norris	Yes , ”
Mrs. Norris	she looks very well . I sent Chapman to her . ”
Mrs. Norris	Look well ! Oh , yes ! ”
Mrs. Norris	she has good reason to look well with all her advantages : brought up in this family as she has been , with all the benefit of her cousins ’ manners before her . Only think , my dear Sir Thomas , what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of giving her . The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married . What would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand ? ”
Mrs. Norris	Yes , she does look very well , ”
Mrs. Norris	Chapman helped her to dress . I sent Chapman to her . ”
Mrs. Norris	What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter , a girl now nine years old , of an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give ? The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing , compared with the benevolence of the action . ”
Mrs. Norris	I think we can not do better , ”
Mrs. Norris	let us send for the child . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion . Having no children of my own , who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow , but the children of my sisters?—and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just — but you know I am a woman of few words and professions . Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle . Give a girl an education , and introduce her properly into the world , and ten to one but she has the means of settling well , without farther expense to anybody . A niece of ours , Sir Thomas , I may say , or at least of _ yours _ , would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages . I do n’t say she would be so handsome as her cousins . I dare say she would not ; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as , in all human probability , would get her a creditable establishment . You are thinking of your sons — but do not you know that , of all things upon earth , _ that _ is the least likely to happen , brought up as they would be , always together like brothers and sisters ? It is morally impossible . I never knew an instance of it . It is , in fact , the only sure way of providing against the connexion . Suppose her a pretty girl , and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence , and I dare say there would be mischief . The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect , would be enough to make either of the dear , sweet - tempered boys in love with her . But breed her up with them from this time , and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel , and she will never be more to either than a sister .
Mrs. Norris	“ I thoroughly understand you ,
Mrs. Norris	“ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point . Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . Is not she a sister ’s child ? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her ? My dear Sir Thomas , with all my faults I have a warm heart ; and , poor as I am , would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing . So , if you are not against it , I will write to my poor sister tomorrow , and make the proposal ; and , as soon as matters are settled , _ I _ will engage to get the child to Mansfield ; _ you _ shall have no trouble about it . My own trouble , you know , I never regard . I will send Nanny to London on purpose , and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler ’s , and the child be appointed to meet her there . They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach , under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going . I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman ’s wife or other going up .
Mrs. Norris	“ Where shall the child come to first , sister , to you or to us ?
Mrs. Norris	“ Then she had better come to us ,
Mrs. Norris	“ Very true ,
Mrs. Norris	“ which are both very important considerations ; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach , or only two — there can be no difference . I only wish I could be more useful ; but you see I do all in my power . I am not one of those that spare their own trouble ; and Nanny shall fetch her , however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days . I suppose , sister , you will put the child in the little white attic , near the old nurseries . It will be much the best place for her , so near Miss Lee , and not far from the girls , and close by the housemaids , who could either of them help to dress her , you know , and take care of her clothes , for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others . Indeed , I do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else .
Mrs. Norris	“ I hope she will prove a well - disposed girl ,
Mrs. Norris	“ and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends .
Mrs. Norris	“ That is exactly what I think ,
Mrs. Norris	“ and what I was saying to my husband this morning . It will be an education for the child , said I , only being with her cousins ; if Miss Lee taught her nothing , she would learn to be good and clever from _ them _ .
Mrs. Norris	“ I hope she will not tease my poor pug ,
Mrs. Norris	“ I have but just got Julia to leave it alone .
Mrs. Norris	“ as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my _ daughters _ the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a _ Miss Bertram _ . I should wish to see them very good friends , and would , on no account , authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation ; but still they can not be equals . Their rank , fortune , rights , and expectations will always be different . It is a point of great delicacy , and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct .
Mrs. Norris	Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , ”
Mrs. Norris	have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , ” said
Mrs. Norris	I can hardly suppose — and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant . And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , _ I _ see him to be an indolent , selfish _ bon _ _ vivant _ , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife . To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of . My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it . ” “
Mrs. Norris	, ” replied
Mrs. Norris	we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a — not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman . Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation — where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the _ frequency _ , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now . A man — a sensible man like Dr. Grant , can not be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week , can not go to church twice every Sunday , and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does , without being the better for it himself . It must make him think ; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman . ” “
Mrs. Norris	can not prove to the contrary , to be sure ; but I wish you a better fate , Miss Price , than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons ; for though he may preach himself into a good - humour every Sunday , it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night . ” “
Mrs. Norris	think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny , ” said
Mrs. Norris	be beyond the reach of any sermons . ” Fanny
Mrs. Norris	goes good - humour , I am sure , ” said
Mrs. Norris	she should have been in such hands ! ” Fanny
Mrs. Norris	’s harmony ! ” said
Mrs. Norris	’s repose ! Here ’s what may leave all painting and all music behind , and what poetry only can attempt to describe ! Here ’s what may tranquillise every care , and lift the heart to rapture ! When I look out on such a night as this , I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world ; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to , and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene . ” “
Mrs. Norris	like to hear your enthusiasm , Fanny . It is a lovely night , and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel , in some degree , as you do ; who have not , at least , been given a taste for Nature in early life . They lose a great deal . ” “
Mrs. Norris	You _ taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . ” “
Mrs. Norris	had a very apt scholar . There ’s Arcturus looking very bright . ” “
Mrs. Norris	, and the Bear . I wish I could see Cassiopeia . ” “
Mrs. Norris	must go out on the lawn for that . Should you be afraid ? ” “
Mrs. Norris	in the least . It is a great while since we have had any star - gazing . ” “
Mrs. Norris	; I do not know how it has happened . ” The
Mr. Rushworth	I wish you could see Compton , ”
Mr. Rushworth	it is the most complete thing ! I never saw a place so altered in my life . I told Smith I did not know where I was . The approach _ now _ , is one of the finest things in the country : you see the house in the most surprising manner . I declare , when I got back to Sotherton yesterday , it looked like a prison — quite a dismal old prison . ”
Mr. Rushworth	The soil is good ; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Sir , it is a Moor Park , we bought it as a Moor Park , and it cost us — that is , it was a present from Sir Thomas , but I saw the bill — and I know it cost seven shillings , and was charged as a Moor Park . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Smith ’s place is the admiration of all the country ; and it was a mere nothing before Repton took it in hand . I think I shall have Repton . ”
Mr. Rushworth	I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance , Fanny . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Have you never been there ? No , you never can ; and , unluckily , it is out of distance for a ride . I wish we could contrive it . ”
Mr. Rushworth	_ You _ would know what you were about , of course ; but that would not suit _ me _ . I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters , but as they are before me ; and had I a place of my own in the country , I should be most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it , and give me as much beauty as he could for my money ; and I should never look at it till it was complete . ”
Mr. Rushworth	I go too ? Had not I better go too ? Will not it be right for me to go too ? ” but
Mr. Rushworth	come home to be happy and indulgent . ” Then
Mr. Rushworth	and Miss Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield . Do you find them agreeable acquaintance ? ” Tom
Mr. Rushworth	do not say he is not gentleman - like , considering ; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight , or he will be expecting a well - looking man . ” Sir
Mr. Rushworth	I must say what I think , ” continued
Mr. Rushworth	my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing . It is having too much of a good thing . I am not so fond of acting as I was at first . I think we are a great deal better employed , sitting comfortably here among ourselves , and doing nothing . ” Sir
Mr. Rushworth	If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return , it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married , ”
Mr. Rushworth	like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ” said
Mr. Rushworth	are very elegant , agreeable girls . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	yet , in general , nothing can be more easily ascertained . The distinction is so broad . Manners as well as appearance are , generally speaking , so totally different . Till now , I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl ’s being out or not . A girl not out has always the same sort of dress : a close bonnet , for instance ; looks very demure , and never says a word . You may smile , but it is so , I assure you ; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far , it is all very proper . Girls should be quiet and modest . The most objectionable part is , that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden . They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite — to confidence ! _ That _ is the faulty part of the present system . One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing — and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before . Mr. Bertram , I dare say _ you _ have sometimes met with such changes . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	believe I have , but this is hardly fair ; I see what you are at . You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	, indeed . Miss Anderson ! I do not know who or what you mean . I am quite in the dark . But I _ will _ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	! you carry it off very well , but I can not be quite so far imposed on . You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye , in describing an altered young lady . You paint too accurately for mistake . It was exactly so . The Andersons of Baker Street . We were speaking of them the other day , you know . Edmund , you have heard me mention Charles Anderson . The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it . When Anderson first introduced me to his family , about two years ago , his sister was not _ out _ , and I could not get her to speak to me . I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson , with only her and a little girl or two in the room , the governess being sick or run away , and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business , and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady — nothing like a civil answer — she screwed up her mouth , and turned from me with such an air ! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth . She was then _ out _ . I met her at Mrs. Holford ’s , and did not recollect her . She came up to me , claimed me as an acquaintance , stared me out of countenance ; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look . I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time , and Miss Crawford , it is plain , has heard the story . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	who are showing the world what female manners _ should _ be , ” said
Mr. Rushworth	doing a great deal to set them right . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	error is plain enough , ” said
Mr. Rushworth	girls are ill brought up . They are given wrong notions from the beginning . They are always acting upon motives of vanity , and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour _ before _ they appear in public than afterwards . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	do not know , ” replied
Mr. Rushworth	, I can not agree with you there . It is certainly the modestest part of the business . It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were , which I have seen done . That is worse than anything — quite disgusting ! ” “
Mr. Rushworth	leads one astray ; one does not know what to do . The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well ( and nothing was ever juster ) , tell one what is expected ; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them . I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September , just after my return from the West Indies . My friend Sneyd — you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund — his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me . When we reached Albion Place they were out ; we went after them , and found them on the pier : Mrs. and the two Miss Sneyds , with others of their acquaintance . I made my bow in form ; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men , attached myself to one of her daughters , walked by her side all the way home , and made myself as agreeable as I could ; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners , and as ready to talk as to listen . I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong . They looked just the same : both well - dressed , with veils and parasols like other girls ; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not _ out _ , and had most excessively offended the eldest . Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months ; and Miss Sneyd , I believe , has never forgiven me . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	was bad indeed . Poor Miss Sneyd . Though I have no younger sister , I feel for her . To be neglected before one ’s time must be very vexatious ; but it was entirely the mother ’s fault . Miss Augusta should have been with her governess . Such half - and - half doings never prosper . But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price . Does she go to balls ? Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister ’s ? ” “
Mr. Rushworth	every play is to be objected to , you will act nothing , and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away , and I am sure _ that _ would be a discredit to us all . I do not know the play ; but , as Maria says , if there is anything a little too warm ( and it is so with most of them ) it can be easily left out . We must not be over - precise , Edmund . As Mr. Rushworth is to act too , there can be no harm . I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day ’s work about those side - doors . The curtain will be a good job , however . The maids do their work very well , and I think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings . There is no occasion to put them so very close together . I _ am _ of some use , I hope , in preventing waste and making the most of things . There should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones . I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day . I had been looking about me in the poultry - yard , and was just coming out , when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants ’ hall - door with two bits of deal board in his hand , bringing them to father , you may be sure ; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father , and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board , for he could not no how do without them . I knew what all this meant , for the servants ’ dinner - bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads ; and as I hate such encroaching people ( the Jacksons are very encroaching , I have always said so : just the sort of people to get all they can ) , I said to the boy directly ( a great lubberly fellow of ten years old , you know , who ought to be ashamed of himself ) , ‘ _ I ’ll _ take the boards to your father , Dick , so get you home again as fast as you can . ’ The boy looked very silly , and turned away without offering a word , for I believe I might speak pretty sharp ; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while . I hate such greediness — so good as your father is to the family , employing the man all the year round ! ” Nobody
Mr. Rushworth	, how do you go on ? ” and
Mr. Rushworth	have you settled ? ” and
Mr. Rushworth	! we can do nothing without you , ” followed
Mr. Rushworth	It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , ”
Mr. Rushworth	Heyday ! Where are the others ? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you . ”
Mr. Rushworth	I do not believe I shall go any farther , ”
Mr. Rushworth	I see nothing of them . By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else . I have had walking enough . ”
Mr. Rushworth	I am very sorry , ”
Mr. Rushworth	it is very unlucky . ”
Mr. Rushworth	I think they might as well have staid for me , ”
Mr. Rushworth	I do not think him at all handsome . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Well , ”
Mr. Rushworth	if you really think I had better go : it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing . ”
Mr. Rushworth	I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . ”
Mr. Rushworth	My dear , it is only a beautiful little heath , which that nice old gardener would make me take ; but if it is in your way , I will have it in my lap directly . There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner . Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker , but my taking one of the cheeses . I stood out as long as I could , till the tears almost came into her eyes , and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with . That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure ! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table , and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns . Take care of the cheese , Fanny . Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Spunging , my dear ! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants ’ eggs , which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me : she would not take a denial . She said it must be such an amusement to me , as she understood I lived quite alone , to have a few living creatures of that sort ; and so to be sure it will . I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen , and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop ; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them . And if I have good luck , your mother shall have some . ”
Mr. Rushworth	will , indeed , after such an absence ; an absence not only long , but including so many dangers . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	n’t be affronted , ” said
Mr. Rushworth	it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes , who , after performing great exploits in a foreign land , offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	yes I know it is . I was merely joking . She has done no more than what every young woman would do ; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy . My other sacrifice , of course , you do not understand . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	taking orders , I assure you , is quite as voluntary as Maria ’s marrying . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	is fortunate that your inclination and your father ’s convenience should accord so well . There is a very good living kept for you , I understand , hereabouts . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	you suppose has biassed me ? ” “
Mr. Rushworth	_ that _ I am sure it has not , ” cried
Mr. Rushworth	you for your good word , Fanny , but it is more than I would affirm myself . On the contrary , the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me . Nor can I think it wrong that it should . There was no natural disinclination to be overcome , and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life . I was in safe hands . I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way , and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it . I have no doubt that I was biased , but I think it was blamelessly . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	is the same sort of thing , ” said
Mr. Rushworth	for the son of an admiral to go into the navy , or the son of a general to be in the army , and nobody sees anything wrong in that . Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best , or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	, my dear Miss Price , and for reasons good . The profession , either navy or army , is its own justification . It has everything in its favour : heroism , danger , bustle , fashion . Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society . Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected , you think ? ” said
Mr. Rushworth	be justified in your eyes , he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	! take orders without a living ! No ; that is madness indeed ; absolute madness . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ? No ; for you certainly would not know what to say . But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument . As he can not be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession , as heroism , and noise , and fashion , are all against him , he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made , to the trouble of working for one ; and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat , drink , and grow fat . It is indolence , Mr. Bertram , indeed . Indolence and love of ease ; a want of all laudable ambition , of taste for good company , or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable , which make men clergymen . A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish — read the newspaper , watch the weather , and quarrel with his wife . His curate does all the work , and the business of his own life is to dine . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	are such clergymen , no doubt , but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character . I suspect that in this comprehensive and ( may I say ) commonplace censure , you are not judging from yourself , but from prejudiced persons , whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing . It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy . You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively . You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle ’s table . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	speak what appears to me the general opinion ; and where an opinion is general , it is usually correct . Though _ I _ have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen , it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	any one body of educated men , of whatever denomination , are condemned indiscriminately , there must be a deficiency of information , or ( smiling ) of something else . Your uncle , and his brother admirals , perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom , good or bad , they were always wishing away . ” “
Mr. Rushworth	William ! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp , ” was
Tom Bertram	, to see real acting , good hardened real acting ; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade : a set of gentlemen and ladies , who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through . ” After
Tom Bertram	know all that , ” said
Tom Bertram	know my father as well as you do ; and I ’ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him . Manage your own concerns , Edmund , and I ’ll take care of the rest of the family . ” “
Tom Bertram	This will never do , ”
Tom Bertram	It falls as naturally , as necessarily to her , ”
Tom Bertram	as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters . It can be no sacrifice on their side , for it is highly comic . ”
Tom Bertram	Oh yes ! Maria must be Agatha . Maria will be the best Agatha . Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy , I would not trust her in it . There is nothing of tragedy about her . She has not the look of it . Her features are not tragic features , and she walks too quick , and speaks too quick , and would not keep her countenance . She had better do the old countrywoman : the Cottager ’s wife ; you had , indeed , Julia . Cottager ’s wife is a very pretty part , I assure you . The old lady relieves the high - flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit . You shall be Cottager ’s wife . ”
Tom Bertram	Miss Crawford must be Amelia . She will be an excellent Amelia . ”
Tom Bertram	can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up . I can not but suppose you _ will _ when you have read it carefully over . Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt , and see how you can approve it . It will not be necessary to send you to your _ father ’s _ judgment , I am convinced . ” “
Tom Bertram	must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ” cried
Tom Bertram	Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , ” Edmund
Mr. Yates	was a hard case , upon my word ” ;
Mr. Yates	do think you were very much to be pitied , ” were
Mr. Yates	is not worth complaining about ; but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time ; and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted . It was but three days ; and being only a grandmother , and all happening two hundred miles off , I think there would have been no great harm , and it was suggested , I know ; but Lord Ravenshaw , who I suppose is one of the most correct men in England , would not hear of it . ” “
Mr. Yates	afterpiece instead of a comedy , ” said
Mr. Yates	’ Vows were at an end , and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by themselves . Well , the jointure may comfort _ him _ ; and perhaps , between friends , he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron , and was not sorry to withdraw ; and to make _ you _ amends , Yates , I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield , and ask you to be our manager . ” This
Mr. Yates	for the Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with . ” Each
Mr. Yates	must have a curtain , ” said
Mr. Yates	few yards of green baize for a curtain , and perhaps that may be enough . ” “
Mr. Yates	, quite enough , ” cried
Mr. Yates	only just a side wing or two run up , doors in flat , and three or four scenes to be let down ; nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this . For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more . ” “
Mr. Yates	believe we must be satisfied with _ less _ , ” said
Mr. Yates	would not be time , and other difficulties would arise . We must rather adopt Mr. Crawford ’s views , and make the _ performance _ , not the _ theatre _ , our object . Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery . ” “
Mr. Yates	, ” said
Mr. Yates	us do nothing by halves . If we are to act , let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit , boxes , and gallery , and let us have a play entire from beginning to end ; so as it be a German play , no matter what , with a good tricking , shifting afterpiece , and a figure - dance , and a hornpipe , and a song between the acts . If we do not outdo Ecclesford , we do nothing . ” “
Mr. Yates	, Edmund , do not be disagreeable , ” said
Mr. Yates	serious ! never more so , I assure you . What is there to surprise you in it ? ” “
Mr. Yates	think it would be very wrong . In a _ general _ light , private theatricals are open to some objections , but as _ we _ are circumstanced , I must think it would be highly injudicious , and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind . It would shew great want of feeling on my father ’s account , absent as he is , and in some degree of constant danger ; and it would be imprudent , I think , with regard to Maria , whose situation is a very delicate one , considering everything , extremely delicate . ” “
Mr. Yates	take up a thing so seriously ! as if we were going to act three times a week till my father ’s return , and invite all the country . But it is not to be a display of that sort . We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves , just to vary the scene , and exercise our powers in something new . We want no audience , no publicity . We may be trusted , I think , in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable ; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own . I have no fears and no scruples . And as to my father ’s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he . It is a _ very _ anxious period for her . ” As
Mr. Yates	Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this ? For the life and soul of me , I can not admire him ; and , between ourselves , to see such an undersized , little , mean - looking man , set up for a fine actor , is very ridiculous in my opinion . ”
Mr. Yates	these are fine times for you , but you must not be always walking from one room to the other , and doing the lookings - on at your ease , in this way ; I want you here . I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand , to contrive Mr. Rushworth ’s cloak without sending for any more satin ; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together . There are but three seams ; you may do them in a trice . It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do . _ You _ are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than _ you _ , we should not get on very fast . ”
Mr. Yates	You had better stay till the curtain is hung , ”
Mr. Yates	the curtain will be hung in a day or two — there is very little sense in a play without a curtain — and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons . ”
Mr. Yates	We are wasting time most abominably . Something must be fixed on . No matter what , so that something is chosen . We must not be so nice . A few characters too many must not frighten us . We must _ double _ them . We must descend a little . If a part is insignificant , the greater our credit in making anything of it . From this moment I make no difficulties . I take any part you chuse to give me , so as it be comic . Let it but be comic , I condition for nothing more . ”
Mr. Yates	Cottager ’s wife ! ”
