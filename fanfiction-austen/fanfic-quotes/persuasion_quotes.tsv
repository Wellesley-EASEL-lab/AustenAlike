Anne Elliot	"Ah ! You make the most of it , I know , """
Anne Elliot	"Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop ? """
Anne Elliot	"And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What ! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ? No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded . When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance ! """
Anne Elliot	"She would have turned back then , but for you ? """
Anne Elliot	"She would indeed . I am almost ashamed to say it . """
Anne Elliot	"Happy for her , to have such a mind as yours at hand ! After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see . If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . But this , no doubt , you have been always doing . It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character , that no influence over it can be depended on . You are never sure of a good impression being durable ; everybody may sway it . Let those who would be happy be firm . Here is a nut , """
Anne Elliot	"to exemplify : a beautiful glossy nut , which , blessed with original strength , has outlived all the storms of autumn . Not a puncture , not a weak spot anywhere . This nut , """
Anne Elliot	"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot , is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of . """
Anne Elliot	"Mary is good - natured enough in many respects , """
Anne Elliot	"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride . She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride . We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead . I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne ? """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! yes ; certainly . """
Anne Elliot	"When did that happen ? """
Anne Elliot	"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . Here is excellent room for three , I assure you . If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four . You must , indeed , you must . """
Anne Elliot	"Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ? I do not like having such things so long in hand . I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch . Then there would always be company for them . And very nice young ladies they both are ; I hardly know one from the other . """
Anne Elliot	"Exactly like father and son ! Dear Miss Elliot , may I not say father and son ? """
Anne Elliot	"Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him . I did invite him , you know . I sent him away with smiles . When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him . """
Anne Elliot	"Kindest regards . And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon . Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately . """
Anne Elliot	"And a very good living it was , """
Anne Elliot	"only five - and - twenty miles from Uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of Dorsetshire . In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least , Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation . Not that he will value it as he ought , """
Anne Elliot	"Charles is too cool about sporting . That 's the worst of him . """
Anne Elliot	"I am extremely glad , indeed , """
Anne Elliot	"particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other-- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! yes . My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find . Money , you know , coming down with money -- two daughters at once -- it can not be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things . However , I do not mean to say they have not a right to it . It is very fit they should have daughters ' shares ; and I am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me . Mary does not above half like Henrietta 's match . She never did , you know . But she does not do him justice , nor think enough about Winthrop . I can not make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now . """
Anne Elliot	"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , """
Anne Elliot	"should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? """
Anne Elliot	"Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long . """
Anne Elliot	"That can not be much to your taste , I know , """
Anne Elliot	"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man . """
Anne Elliot	"To be sure he is . Nobody doubts it ; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself . I have a great value for Benwick ; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say . His reading has done him no harm , for he has fought as well as read . He is a brave fellow . I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before . We had a famous set - to at rat - hunting all the morning in my father 's great barns ; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since . """
Anne Elliot	"Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long . We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment 's inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness . """
Anne Elliot	"No , """
Anne Elliot	"it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! Charles , I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go . """
Anne Elliot	"No , I did not promise . I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ` happy . ' There was no promise . """
Anne Elliot	"But you must go , Charles . It would be unpardonable to fail . We were asked on purpose to be introduced . There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves . Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately . We are quite near relations , you know ; and Mr Elliot too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with ! Every attention is due to Mr Elliot . Consider , my father 's heir : the future representative of the family . """
Anne Elliot	"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . What is Mr Elliot to me ? """
Anne Elliot	"We had better put it off . Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday . It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . """
Anne Elliot	"If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary 's account ) would not be the smallest impediment . I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps . """
Anne Elliot	"You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes . """
Anne Elliot	"I am not yet so much changed , """
Anne Elliot	"To - morrow evening , to meet a few friends : no formal party . """
Anne Elliot	"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted ! You see he can not put the card out of his hand . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! dear ! very true . Only think , Miss Elliot , to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street . I was never more astonished . He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard . He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to - morrow . He was full of ` to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! when shall I leave you again ? """
Anne Elliot	"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse . """
Anne Elliot	"The Crofts have arrived in Bath ? The Crofts who rent Kellynch ? What have they brought you ? """
Anne Elliot	"A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! those letters are convenient passports . They secure an introduction . I should have visited Admiral Croft , however , at any rate . I know what is due to my tenant . """
Anne Elliot	"February 1st . """
Anne Elliot	"Mary M--- . """
Anne Elliot	"So ended the first part , which had been afterwards put into an envelope , containing nearly as much more . """
Anne Elliot	"Mary need not have feared her sister 's being in any degree prepared for the news . She had never in her life been more astonished . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! It was almost too wonderful for belief , and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room , preserve an air of calmness , and answer the common questions of the moment . Happily for her , they were not many . Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . """
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth 's share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it . Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel ! Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her . She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend . She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other . Their minds most dissimilar ! Where could have been the attraction ? The answer soon presented itself . It had been in situation . They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta 's coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable . That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself . She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment . He had an affectionate heart . He must love somebody . She saw no reason against their being happy . Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike . He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry . The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste , and sentimental reflection was amusing , but she had no doubt of its being so . The day at Lyme , the fall from the Cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate . The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth 's merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . No , it was not regret which made Anne 's heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free . She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate . They were too much like joy , senseless joy ! She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them . The visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned , and Captain Benwick , too , without even half a smile . The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter 's satisfaction . He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him . The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for , and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form , and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure . They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together . He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good . Anne saw them wherever she went . Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral . He was standing by himself at a printshop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she not only might have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice . When he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour . """
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"taking a last look at the picture , as they began to be in motion . """
Anne Elliot	"When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont ; and as she was not really Mrs Croft , she must let him have his own way . As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont , he began-- """
Anne Elliot	"Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of """
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey , but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther . She therefore satisfied herself with common - place remarks or quiet attention , and the Admiral had it all his own way . """
Anne Elliot	
Anne Elliot	"The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give . Sailors work hard enough for their comforts , we must all allow . """
Anne Elliot	"Yes , Sir , a Mr Elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from Sidmouth . Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London . """
Anne Elliot	"Elliot ! """
Anne Elliot	"No , """
Anne Elliot	"that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , Captain Harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , I understand . """
Anne Elliot	"Ay , true enough , """
Anne Elliot	"only June . """
Anne Elliot	"And not known to him , perhaps , so soon . """
Anne Elliot	"Not till the first week of August , when he came home from the Cape , just made into the Grappler . I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth . There the news must follow him , but who was to tell it ? not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard - arm . Nobody could do it , but that good fellow """
Anne Elliot	"dark blue seas """
Anne Elliot	"She is dead ! she is dead ! """
Anne Elliot	"Go to him , go to him , """
Anne Elliot	"for heaven 's sake go to him . I can support her myself . Leave me , and go to him . Rub her hands , rub her temples ; here are salts ; take them , take them . """
Anne Elliot	"A surgeon ! """
Anne Elliot	"Had not she better be carried to the inn ? Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn . """
Anne Elliot	"I will carry her myself . Musgrove , take care of the others . """
Anne Elliot	"It was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do . A bed on the floor in Louisa 's room would be sufficient for her , if Mrs Harville would but think so . """
Anne Elliot	"Do n't talk of it , do n't talk of it , """
Anne Elliot	"Oh God ! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment ! Had I done as I ought ! But so eager and so resolute ! Dear , sweet Louisa ! """
Anne Elliot	"I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary 's interference , """
Anne Elliot	"Charles spoils the children so that I can not get them into any order , """
Anne Elliot	"Very true . """
Anne Elliot	"or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them . """
Anne Elliot	"Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but I am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house - maid and laundry - maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long . I meet them wherever I go ; and I declare , I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them . If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them . """
Anne Elliot	"Dear me , is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch ? I am glad I did not think of it before . How low it makes me ! """
Anne Elliot	"said he , """
Anne Elliot	"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him , """
Anne Elliot	"but we should not suit . """
Anne Elliot	"I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! """
Anne Elliot	"I should very much like to see Lyme again , """
Anne Elliot	"Indeed ! I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling . The horror and distress you were involved in , the stretch of mind , the wear of spirits ! I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust . """
Anne Elliot	"The last hours were certainly very painful , """
Anne Elliot	"but when pain is over , the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure . One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it , unless it has been all suffering , nothing but suffering , which was by no means the case at Lyme . We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . So much novelty and beauty ! I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short """
Anne Elliot	"they should meet again . He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder . She was in need of a little interval for recollection . """
Anne Elliot	"This , """
Anne Elliot	"is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language . I am a very poor Italian scholar . """
Anne Elliot	"Yes , yes , I see you are . I see you know nothing of the matter . You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted , transposed , curtailed Italian lines , into clear , comprehensible , elegant English . You need not say anything more of your ignorance . Here is complete proof . """
Anne Elliot	"I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient . """
Anne Elliot	"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath . I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . I have been acquainted with you by character many years . Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me . """
Anne Elliot	"No , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now . He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . """
Anne Elliot	"The name of Anne Elliot , """
Anne Elliot	"has long had an interesting sound to me . Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if I dared , I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change . """
Anne Elliot	"A very fine young man indeed ! """
Anne Elliot	"No , I just know his name . A bowing acquaintance . Wentworth ; Captain Wentworth of the navy . His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch . """
Anne Elliot	"He must wish her good night ; he was going ; he should get home as fast as he could . """
Anne Elliot	"Is not this song worth staying for ? """
Anne Elliot	"Yes , and you may guess who it is for . But , """
Anne Elliot	"it was not done for her . Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ? I little thought then-- but no matter . This was drawn at the Cape . He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another ! It was a commission to me ! But who else was there to employ ? I hope I can allow for him . I am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another . He undertakes it ; """
Anne Elliot	"No , """
Anne Elliot	"That I can easily believe . """
Anne Elliot	"It was not in her nature . She doted on him . """
Anne Elliot	"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . """
Anne Elliot	"Do you claim that for your sex ? """
Anne Elliot	"Yes . We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . It is , perhaps , our fate rather than our merit . We can not help ourselves . We live at home , quiet , confined , and our feelings prey upon us . You are forced on exertion . You have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions . """
Anne Elliot	"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , I do not think I shall grant ) , it does not apply to Benwick . He has not been forced upon any exertion . The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since . """
Anne Elliot	"True , """
Anne Elliot	"very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ? If the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man 's nature , which has done the business for Captain Benwick . """
Anne Elliot	"No , no , it is not man 's nature . I will not allow it to be more man 's nature than woman 's to be inconstant and forget those they do love , or have loved . I believe the reverse . I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . """
Anne Elliot	"Your feelings may be the strongest , """
Anne Elliot	"but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . It would be hard , indeed """
Anne Elliot	"Not quite , a few lines more . I shall have done in five minutes . """
Anne Elliot	"There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . I am in very good anchorage here , """
Anne Elliot	"well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . Well , Miss Elliot , """
Anne Elliot	"Perhaps I shall . Yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books . Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands . I will not allow books to prove anything . """
Anne Elliot	"But how shall we prove anything ? """
Anne Elliot	"We never shall . We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point . It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . We each begin , probably , with a little bias towards our own sex ; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle ; many of which circumstances ( perhaps those very cases which strike us the most ) may be precisely such as can not be brought forward without betraying a confidence , or in some respect saying what should not be said . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! """
Anne Elliot	"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow - creatures ! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object . I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone . """
Anne Elliot	"There is no quarrelling with you . And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied . """
Anne Elliot	"I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend . To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , """
Anne Elliot	"We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? """
Anne Elliot	"Miss A. E.-- , """
Anne Elliot	"I can listen no longer in silence . I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach . You pierce my soul . I am half agony , half hope . Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever . I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago . Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman , that his love has an earlier death . I have loved none but you . Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant . You alone have brought me to Bath . For you alone , I think and plan . Have you not seen this ? Can you fail to have understood my wishes ? I had not waited even these ten days , could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write . I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others . Too good , too excellent creature ! You do us justice , indeed . You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . Believe it to be most fervent , most undeviating , in F. W. """
Anne Elliot	"cried Mrs Musgrove , """
Anne Elliot	"But the chair would never do . Worse than all ! To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne . The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night . Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said-- """

Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"Anne could do no more ; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity . It could not be very lasting , however . Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself , it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville . Another momentary vexation occurred . Charles , in his real concern and good nature , would go home with her ; there was no preventing him . This was almost cruel . But she could not be long ungrateful ; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith 's , to be of use to her ; and she set off with him , with no feeling but gratitude apparent . They were on Union Street , when a quicker step behind , a something of familiar sound , gave her two moments ' preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth . He joined them ; but , as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on , said nothing , only looked . Anne could command herself enough to receive that look , and not repulsively . The cheeks which had been pale now glowed , and the movements which had hesitated were decided . He walked by her side . Presently , struck by a sudden thought , Charles said-- """
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"replied Captain Wentworth , surprised . """
Anne Elliot	"cried he , """
Anne Elliot	"said Anne , """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man . I do not know what he would be at . We asked him to come home with us for a day or two : Charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood , ' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come . I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart - broken man as Captain Benwick . """
Anne Elliot	"Now Mary , you know very well how it really was . It was all your doing , """
Anne Elliot	"He fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross ; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off , his heart failed him , and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour , Mary knows it is . """
Anne Elliot	"And I am sure , """
Anne Elliot	"it was a very little to his credit , if he did . Miss Harville only died last June . Such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , Lady Russell ? I am sure you will agree with me . """
Anne Elliot	"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide , """
Anne Elliot	"And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma'am , """
Anne Elliot	"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it . I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church 's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon . So , I give you notice , Lady Russell . """
Anne Elliot	"Any acquaintance of Anne 's will always be welcome to me , """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! as to being Anne 's acquaintance , """
Anne Elliot	"I think he is rather my acquaintance , for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight . """
Anne Elliot	"Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick . """
Anne Elliot	"You will not find anything very agreeable in him , I assure you , ma'am . He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived . He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . He is not at all a well - bred young man . I am sure you will not like him . """
Anne Elliot	"There we differ , Mary , """
Anne Elliot	"I think Lady Russell would like him . I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner . """
Anne Elliot	"I am sure Lady Russell would like him . He is just Lady Russell 's sort . Give him a book , and he will read all day long . """
Anne Elliot	"Yes , that he will ! """
Anne Elliot	"He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop 's one 's scissors , or anything that happens . Do you think Lady Russell would like that ? """
Anne Elliot	"Upon my word , """
Anne Elliot	"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as I may call myself . I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions . I wish he may be induced to call here . And when he does , Mary , you may depend upon hearing my opinion ; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand . """
Anne Elliot	"You will not like him , I will answer for it . """
Anne Elliot	"He is a man , """
Anne Elliot	"whom I have no wish to see . His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . """
Anne Elliot	"I hope I shall remember , in future , """
Anne Elliot	"not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays . """
Anne Elliot	"a man whom she had no wish to see . """
Anne Elliot	"There is hardly any personal defect , """
Anne Elliot	"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to . """
Anne Elliot	"a fine girl . """
Anne Elliot	"So , you are come at last ! I began to think I should never see you . I am so ill I can hardly speak . I have not seen a creature the whole morning ! """
Anne Elliot	"I am sorry to find you unwell , """
Anne Elliot	"You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday ! """
Anne Elliot	"Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure . Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way , and not able to ring the bell ! So , Lady Russell would not get out . I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! Charles is out shooting . I have not seen him since seven o'clock . He would go , though I told him how ill I was . He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one . I assure you , I have not seen a soul this whole long morning . """
Anne Elliot	"You have had your little boys with you ? """
Anne Elliot	"Yes , as long as I could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good . Little Charles does not mind a word I say , and Walter is growing quite as bad . """
Anne Elliot	"Well , you will soon be better now , """
Anne Elliot	"You know I always cure you when I come . How are your neighbours at the Great House ? """
Anne Elliot	"I can give you no account of them . I have not seen one of them to - day , except Mr Musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me . It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves , I suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way . """
Anne Elliot	"You will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone . It is early . """
Anne Elliot	"I never want them , I assure you . They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me . Oh ! Anne , I am so very unwell ! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday . """
Anne Elliot	"My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself ! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . """
Anne Elliot	"Dear me ! what can you possibly have to do ? """
Anne Elliot	"A great many things , I assure you . More than I can recollect in a moment ; but I can tell you some . I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father 's books and pictures . I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of Elizabeth 's plants are for Lady Russell . I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do , Mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave . I was told that they wished it . But all these things took up a great deal of time . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! well ! """
Anne Elliot	"but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday . """
Anne Elliot	"Did you go then ? I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh yes ! I went . I was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning . It would have been strange if I had not gone . """
Anne Elliot	"I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party . """
Anne Elliot	"Nothing remarkable . One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one 's own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward . So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise ; and I think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it . """
Anne Elliot	"Where shall we go ? """
Anne Elliot	"I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you ? """
Anne Elliot	"I have not the smallest objection on that account , """
Anne Elliot	"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible . They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister . However , we may as well go and sit with them a little while , and when we have that over , we can enjoy our walk . """
Anne Elliot	"I am much obliged to you , """
Anne Elliot	"but I am not going with them . The carriage would not accommodate so many . I walk : I prefer walking . """
Anne Elliot	"But it rains . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! very little , Nothing that I regard . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! so do I. """
Anne Elliot	"And so do I. No comparison . But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot . Anne is too delicate for them . """
Anne Elliot	"Now , how would she speak of him ? """
Anne Elliot	"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire . It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , I wanted to be doing something . """
Anne Elliot	"beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether . """
Anne Elliot	"I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; """
Anne Elliot	"These would have been all my friends , """
Anne Elliot	"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the evening ! I knew how it would be . This is always my luck . If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it , and Charles is as bad as any of them . Very unfeeling ! I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy . Talks of his being going on so well ! How does he know that he is going on well , or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence ? I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling . So here he is to go away and enjoy himself , and because I am the poor mother , I am not to be allowed to stir ; and yet , I am sure , I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child . My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried . I am not at all equal to it . You saw how hysterical I was yesterday . """
Anne Elliot	"Dear me ! that 's a very good thought , very good , indeed . To be sure , I may just as well go as not , for I am of no use at home -- am I ? and it only harasses me . You , who have not a mother 's feelings , are a great deal the properest person . You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word . It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima . Oh ! I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone . An excellent thought of yours , indeed , Anne . I will go and tell Charles , and get ready directly . You can send for us , you know , at a moment 's notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you . I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . """
Anne Elliot	"This is very kind of Anne , """
Anne Elliot	"Altered beyond his knowledge . """
Anne Elliot	"So altered that he should not have known her again ! """
Anne Elliot	"A strong mind , with sweetness of manner , """
Anne Elliot	"Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with , but it must not be much . If I am a fool , I shall be a fool indeed , for I have thought on the subject more than most men . """
Anne Elliot	"My dear madam , this must not be . As yet , you have seen nothing of Bath . You have been here only to be useful . You must not run away from us now . You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis , the beautiful Mrs Wallis . To your fine mind , I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification . """
Anne Elliot	"less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher . Had she been using any thing in particular ? """
Anne Elliot	"No , nothing . """
Anne Elliot	"No , nothing at all . """
Anne Elliot	"certainly you can not do better than to continue as you are ; you can not be better than well ; or I should recommend Gowland , the constant use of Gowland , during the spring months . Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation , and you see what it has done for her . You see how it has carried away her freckles . """
Anne Elliot	"Elizabeth . """
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"sounded in her ears all day long . Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount , but had never seen any of the rest of the family ; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony , ever since the death of that said late viscount , when , in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter 's at the same time , there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch . No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland . The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner ; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself , no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch , and , consequently , there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed . How to have this anxious business set to rights , and be admitted as cousins again , was the question : and it was a question which , in a more rational manner , neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant . """
Anne Elliot	"Sir Walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin . Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess . """
Anne Elliot	"The toils of the business were over , the sweets began . They visited in Laura Place , they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and the Honourable Miss Carteret , to be arranged wherever they might be most visible : and """
Anne Elliot	"because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody . Miss Carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth . Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better ; but yet """
Anne Elliot	"and when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value . Anne smiled and said , """
Anne Elliot	"( sitting down by her ) , """
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"sighed Anne , """
Anne Elliot	"then recollecting herself , and not wishing to be answered , she added , """
Anne Elliot	"( smiling ) """
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"said Anne , """
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"said he ; """
Anne Elliot	"( he continued , speaking lower , though there was no one else in the room ) """
Anne Elliot	He looked , as he spoke , to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father 's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her .
Anne Elliot	"Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room . """
Anne Elliot	"The Ibbotsons , were they there ? and the two new beauties , with the tall Irish officer , who is talked of for one of them . """
Anne Elliot	"I do not know . I do not think they were . """
Anne Elliot	"Old Lady Mary Maclean ? I need not ask after her . She never misses , I know ; and you must have seen her . She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course . """
Anne Elliot	"No , that was what I dreaded . It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect . But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off ; and we were exceedingly well placed , that is , for hearing ; I must not say for seeing , because I appear to have seen very little . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! you saw enough for your own amusement . I can understand . There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd , and this you had . You were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond . """
Anne Elliot	"But I ought to have looked about me more , """
Anne Elliot	"No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . I see it in your eye . I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to . In the intervals of the concert it was conversation . """
Anne Elliot	"Do you see that in my eye ? """
Anne Elliot	"Yes , I do . Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together . """
Anne Elliot	"Mr Elliot ! """
Anne Elliot	"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ? """
Anne Elliot	"I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , """
Anne Elliot	"but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation . If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . """
Anne Elliot	"I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon . I ought to have waited for official information , But now , my dear Miss Elliot , as an old friend , do give me a hint as to when I may speak . Next week ? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot 's good fortune . """
Anne Elliot	"No , """
Anne Elliot	"nor next week , nor next , nor next . I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . I am not going to marry Mr Elliot . I should like to know why you imagine I am ? """
Anne Elliot	"Now , how I do wish I understood you ! How I do wish I knew what you were at ! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs . Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? Let me plead for my -- present friend I can not call him , but for my former friend . Where can you look for a more suitable match ? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot . I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ? """
Anne Elliot	"My dear Mrs Smith , Mr Elliot 's wife has not been dead much above half a year . He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! if these are your only objections , """
Anne Elliot	"No , """
Anne Elliot	"I can readily believe all that of my cousin . He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions . I consider him with great respect . I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise . But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ? Surely this must be calm enough . And , upon my word , he is nothing to me . Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ) , I shall not accept him . I assure you I shall not . I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that-- """
Anne Elliot	"Do tell me how it first came into your head . """
Anne Elliot	"And has it indeed been spoken of ? """
Anne Elliot	"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ? """
Anne Elliot	"No . Was not it Mrs Speed , as usual , or the maid ? I observed no one in particular . """
Anne Elliot	"It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by - the - bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot . She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority . She sat an hour with me on Monday evening , and gave me the whole history . """
Anne Elliot	"The whole history , """
Anne Elliot	"She could not make a very long history , I think , of one such little article of unfounded news . """
Anne Elliot	"But , """
Anne Elliot	"though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could . Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ? Shall I take any message ? """
Anne Elliot	"No , I thank you : no , certainly not . In the warmth of the moment , and under a mistaken impression , I might , perhaps , have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances ; but not now . No , I thank you , I have nothing to trouble you with . """
Anne Elliot	"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ? """
Anne Elliot	"I did . """
Anne Elliot	"Not before he was married , I suppose ? """
Anne Elliot	"Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first . """
Anne Elliot	"And -- were you much acquainted ? """
Anne Elliot	"Intimately . """
Anne Elliot	"Indeed ! Then do tell me what he was at that time of life . I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man . Was he at all such as he appears now ? """
Anne Elliot	"I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot , """
Anne Elliot	"I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do . I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you . There were many things to be taken into the account . One hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief . Even the smooth surface of family - union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath . However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot 's real character . Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him . Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold - blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others . Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . Oh ! he is black at heart , hollow and black ! """
Anne Elliot	"My expressions startle you . You must allow for an injured , angry woman . But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him . I will only tell you what I have found him . Facts shall speak . He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . The intimacy had been formed before our marriage . I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him . At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together . We were principally in town , living in very good style . He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother . My poor Charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him . """
Anne Elliot	"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot 's life , """
Anne Elliot	"which has always excited my particular curiosity . It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times . It seemed to announce a different sort of man . """
Anne Elliot	"He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever . I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go . I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time . I was privy to all the fors and againsts ; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put . """
Anne Elliot	"Nay , """
Anne Elliot	"I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ? """
Anne Elliot	"Perhaps , """
Anne Elliot	"you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ? """
Anne Elliot	"To be sure I did ; very often . I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from-- """
Anne Elliot	"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night , """
Anne Elliot	"This explains it . I found he had been used to hear of me . I could not comprehend how . What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned ! How sure to be mistaken ! But I beg your pardon ; I have interrupted you . Mr Elliot married then completely for money ? The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . """
Anne Elliot	"Oh ! those things are too common . When one lives in the world , a man or woman 's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . I was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct . We lived for enjoyment . I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing . ` To do the best for himself , ' passed as a duty . """
Anne Elliot	"But was not she a very low woman ? """
Anne Elliot	"Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard . Money , money , was all that he wanted . Her father was a grazier , her grandfather had been a butcher , but that was all nothing . She was a fine woman , had had a decent education , was brought forward by some cousins , thrown by chance into Mr Elliot 's company , and fell in love with him ; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side , with respect to her birth . All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune , before he committed himself . Depend upon it , whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it . His chance for the Kellynch estate was something , but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt . I have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject . It would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof . """
Anne Elliot	"Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none , """
Anne Elliot	"You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago . This is all in confirmation , rather , of what we used to hear and believe . I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . """
Anne Elliot	"But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . """
Anne Elliot	"Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said-- """
Anne Elliot	""""
Anne Elliot	"said Anne , """
Anne Elliot	"What should they do without her ? They were wretched comforters for one another . """
Anne Elliot	"Another time , Sir , I thank you , not now . """
Anne Elliot	"Well , whenever it suits you . You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door . A good place is not it ? But , """
Anne Elliot	"We have made very few changes either , """
Anne Elliot	"Very few . We told you about the laundry - door , at Uppercross . That has been a very great improvement . The wonder was , how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did , so long ! You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however . I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father 's . A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot , """
Anne Elliot	"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . Such a number of looking - glasses ! oh Lord ! there was no getting away from one 's self . So I got Sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now I am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that I never go near . """
Mary Musgrove	"I can not imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk , """
Mary Musgrove	"Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker ; and yet they would not have been pleased , if we had refused to join them . When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ? """
Mary Musgrove	"Bless me ! here is Winthrop . I declare I had no idea ! Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . """
Mary Musgrove	"Oh ! no , indeed ! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ; """
Mary Musgrove	"Anne , """
Mary Musgrove	"there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her . I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now . They seemed deep in talk . Who is it ? Come , and tell me . Good heavens ! I recollect . It is Mr Elliot himself . """
Mary Musgrove	"Do come , Anne """
Mary Musgrove	"come and look yourself . You will be too late if you do not make haste . They are parting ; they are shaking hands . He is turning away . Not know Mr Elliot , indeed ! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme . """
Mary Musgrove	"Only think of Elizabeth 's including everybody ! """
Mary Musgrove	"said Elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer , """
Mary Musgrove	"Bless me ! """
Mary Musgrove	"it must be our cousin ; it must be our Mr Elliot , it must , indeed ! Charles , Anne , must not it ? In mourning , you see , just as our Mr Elliot must be . How very extraordinary ! In the very same inn with us ! Anne , must not it be our Mr Elliot ? my father 's next heir ? Pray sir , """
Mary Musgrove	"just as I said ! Heir to Sir Walter Elliot ! I was sure that would come out , if it was so . Depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes . But , Anne , only conceive how extraordinary ! I wish I had looked at him more . I wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us . What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other ! Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ? I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me ! Oh ! the great - coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms , so it did ; otherwise , I am sure , I should have observed them , and the livery too ; if the servant had not been in mourning , one should have known him by the livery . """
Mary Musgrove	"Of course , """
Mary Musgrove	"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot , the next time you write to Bath . I think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him . """
Mary Musgrove	"Nobody knew how much she should suffer . She should put it off as long as she could ; """
Mary Musgrove	"I can not possibly do without Anne , """
Mary Musgrove	"Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath . """
Mary Musgrove	"Mrs Clay , """
Mary Musgrove	"never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people . And as to my father , I really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now . If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety . One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times . That tooth of her 's and those freckles . Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him . I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them . You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay 's freckles . """
Mary Musgrove	"I think very differently , """
Mary Musgrove	"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones . However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me . """
Mary Musgrove	"Are you serious ? """
Charles Musgrove	"No ! """
Charles Musgrove	"No , no ! """
Charles Musgrove	"Phoo ! phoo ! """
Charles Musgrove	"what 's an evening party ? Never worth remembering . Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us . You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play . """
Charles Musgrove	"Do n't talk to me about heirs and representatives , """
Charles Musgrove	"Anne , Anne , """
Charles Musgrove	"What is to be done next ? What , in heaven 's name , is to be done next ? """
Charles Musgrove	"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft 's here soon ; I dare say you know him by name . """
Charles Musgrove	"in such terms-- """
Charles Musgrove	"No , """
Charles Musgrove	"I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly . His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh ! I can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms ! Now Mary , I declare it was so , I heard it myself , and you were in the other room . ` Elegance , sweetness , beauty . ' Oh ! there was no end of Miss Elliot 's charms . """
Charles Musgrove	"So do I , Anne , """
Charles Musgrove	"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother . I always forgot . """
Charles Musgrove	"It was at Gibraltar , mother , I know . Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth . """
Charles Musgrove	"Nothing can be going on better than the child , """
Charles Musgrove	"so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right . Your sister being with you , my love , I have no scruple at all . You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use . Anne will send for me if anything is the matter . """
Lady Russell	. She was of strict integrity
Lady Russell	with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding . She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value
Lady Russell	gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and Sir Walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of Anne and her sisters , was , as being Sir Walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt . But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth . She drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did
Lady Russell	: Elizabeth would go her own way ; and
Lady Russell	it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning
Lady Russell	"asked Elizabeth . """
Lady Russell	"I am no match - maker , as you well know , """
Lady Russell	"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . A most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but I think it might be a very happy one . """
Lady Russell	"You will wonder , """
Lady Russell	"what has been fixing my eye so long ; but I was looking after some window - curtains , which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night . They described the drawing - room window - curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description . """
Lady Russell	"now Miss Anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; """
Lady Russell	"Merely Gowland , """
Lady Russell	"Ha ! he was surprised at that ; """
Lady Russell	"It was a reference to the future , which Anne , after a little observation , felt she must submit to . She could determine nothing at present . In that house Elizabeth must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as """
Lady Russell	"that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible . Mr Elliot , too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months . A little delay on his side might be very excusable . In fact , Anne could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved . However it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself . They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times . He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . She knew it well ; and she remembered another person 's look also . They did not always think alike . His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers . It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister 's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them . The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and her daughter , the Honourable Miss Carteret ; and all the comfort of No.-- , Camden Place , was swept away for many days ; for the Dalrymples ( in Anne 's opinion , most unfortunately ) were cousins of the Elliots ; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly . Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility , and she must acknowledge herself disappointed . She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for """
Lady Russell	"If we can persuade your father to all this , """
Lady Russell	"much may be done . If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . """
Lady Russell	"What ! every comfort of life knocked off ! Journeys , London , servants , horses , table-- contractions and restrictions every where ! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman ! No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms . """
Lady Russell	"Quit Kellynch Hall . """
Lady Russell	"I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon . Anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ? It will be some trial to us both . """
Lady Russell	"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it . """
Mrs. Croft	"Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired , """
Mrs. Croft	"We had better not talk about it , my dear , """
Mrs. Croft	"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . I had known you by character , however , long before . """
Mrs. Croft	"Very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed , """
Mrs. Croft	"and a very respectable family . One could not be connected with better people . My dear Admiral , that post ! we shall certainly take that post . """
Mrs. Croft	"It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country . """
Mrs. Croft	"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ? """
Mrs. Croft	"That is precisely what I was going to observe , """
Mrs. Croft	"Yes , dear ma'am , """
Mrs. Croft	"or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long . To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can . """
Mrs. Croft	"Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe , """
Mrs. Croft	"said he , """
Mrs. Croft	"And I do assure you , ma'am , """
Mrs. Croft	"that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man - of - war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates . When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared . Thank God ! I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me . A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards . The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when the Admiral ( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas . I lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when I should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and I never met with the smallest inconvenience . """
Captain Wentworth	"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister ! They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills . They talked of coming into this side of the country . I wonder whereabouts they will upset to - day . Oh ! it does happen very often , I assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not . """
Captain Wentworth	"It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . """
Captain Wentworth	"My first wish for all whom I am interested in , is that they should be firm . If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life , she will cherish all her present powers of mind . """
Captain Wentworth	"Do you mean that she refused him ? """
Captain Wentworth	"I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary . I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not . They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . """
Captain Wentworth	"Frederick . """
Captain Wentworth	"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy , """
Captain Wentworth	"but there is no saying which . He has been running after them , too , long enough , one would think , to make up his mind . Ay , this comes of the peace . If it were war now , he would have settled it long ago . We sailors , Miss Elliot , can not afford to make long courtships in time of war . How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ? """
Captain Wentworth	"Anne was caught . She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick 's manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , """
Captain Wentworth	"but the Admiral interrupted her with-- """
Captain Wentworth	"said he at last . """
Captain Wentworth	"It would not be a great match for her ; but if Henrietta liked him,""-- and Henrietta did seem to like him . Henrietta fully thought so herself , before Captain Wentworth came ; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten . Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful , as far as Anne 's observation reached . Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , Louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him . Mr and Mrs Musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion - house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves ' company , and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared , when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to which was the one liked best . Charles gave it for Louisa , Mary for Henrietta , but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful . Charles """
Captain Wentworth	""""
Captain Wentworth	"cried Mary to Anne , as soon as he was out of the room , """
Captain Wentworth	"said she , """
Captain Wentworth	"But not a bit did Walter stir . In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it . Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . She could not even thank him . She could only hang over little Charles , with most disordered feelings . His kindness in stepping forward to her relief , the manner , the silence in which it had passed , the little particulars of the circumstance , with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child , that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks , and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants , produced such a confusion of varying , but very painful agitation , as she could not recover from , till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares , and leave the room . She could not stay . It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four-- they were now altogether ; but she could stay for none of it . It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth . She had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after Captain Wentworth 's interference , """
Captain Wentworth	"That man is struck with you , and even I , at this moment , see something like Anne Elliot again . """
Captain Wentworth	"Ah ! """
Captain Wentworth	"it is the very man we passed . """
Captain Wentworth	"Pray , """
Captain Wentworth	"can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ? """
Captain Wentworth	"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together , """
Captain Wentworth	"we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin . """
Captain Wentworth	"The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again . He stood his chance for the rest ; wrote up for leave of absence , but without waiting the return , travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth , rowed off to the Grappler that instant , and never left the poor fellow for a week . That 's what he did , and nobody else could have saved poor James . You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us ! """
Captain Wentworth	"I am determined I will : """
Captain Wentworth	"Is there no one to help me ? """
Captain Wentworth	"Oh God ! her father and mother ! """
Captain Wentworth	"Yes , yes , to the inn , """
Captain Wentworth	"Thank God ! """
Captain Wentworth	"We must be decided , and without the loss of another minute . Every minute is valuable . Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly . Musgrove , either you or I must go . """
Captain Wentworth	"Then it is settled , Musgrove , """
Captain Wentworth	"that you stay , and that I take care of your sister home . But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one . Mrs Charles Musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if Anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as Anne . """
Captain Wentworth	"You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; """
Captain Wentworth	"I have been considering what we had best do . She must not appear at first . She could not stand it . I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove . Do you think this is a good plan ? """
Captain Wentworth	"How do you do ? """
Captain Wentworth	"It was a frightful hour , """
Captain Wentworth	"a frightful day ! """
Captain Wentworth	"The day has produced some effects however ; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful . When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon , you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery . """
Captain Wentworth	"Certainly I could have none . But it appears -- I should hope it would be a very happy match . There are on both sides good principles and good temper . """
Captain Wentworth	"Yes , """
Captain Wentworth	"but there , I think , ends the resemblance . With all my soul I wish them happy , and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it . They have no difficulties to contend with at home , no opposition , no caprice , no delays . The Musgroves are behaving like themselves , most honourably and kindly , only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter 's comfort . All this is much , very much in favour of their happiness ; more than perhaps-- """
Captain Wentworth	"I confess that I do think there is a disparity , too great a disparity , and in a point no less essential than mind . I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable , sweet - tempered girl , and not deficient in understanding , but Benwick is something more . He is a clever man , a reading man ; and I confess , that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . But I have no reason to suppose it so . It seems , on the contrary , to have been a perfectly spontaneous , untaught feeling on his side , and this surprises me . A man like him , in his situation ! with a heart pierced , wounded , almost broken ! Fanny Harville was a very superior creature , and his attachment to her was indeed attachment . A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . He ought not ; he does not . """
Captain Wentworth	"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long , """
Captain Wentworth	"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot ; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman . """
Captain Wentworth	"For shame ! for shame ! this is too much flattery . I forget what we are to have next , """
Captain Wentworth	"No ! """
Captain Wentworth	"there is nothing worth my staying for ; """
Captain Wentworth	"he is writing about it now . """
Captain Wentworth	"if woman 's feelings were to be added to all this . """
Captain Wentworth	"We shall never agree upon this question , """
Captain Wentworth	"Yes , """
Captain Wentworth	"very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute . I know you will not be sorry to be off . I shall be at your service in half a minute . """
Captain Wentworth	"There could not be an objection . There could be only the most proper alacrity , a most obliging compliance for public view ; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture . In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement . There they returned again into the past , more exquisitely happy , perhaps , in their re - union , than when it had been first projected ; more tender , more tried , more fixed in a knowledge of each other 's character , truth , and attachment ; more equal to act , more justified in acting . And there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery - maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest . All the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end . She had not mistaken him . Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings . Of what he had then written , nothing was to be retracted or qualified . He persisted in having loved none but her . She had never been supplanted . He never even believed himself to see her equal . Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done . He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself . At Lyme , he had received lessons of more than one sort . The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville 's had fixed her superiority . In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa 's could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way . From that period his penance had become severe . He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa 's accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty . """
Captain Wentworth	"Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , """
Captain Wentworth	"I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . """
Captain Wentworth	"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot . He will be here in a moment , I am sure . """
Captain Wentworth	"Good morning to you ! """
Captain Wentworth	"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin , I fancy ? """
Captain Wentworth	"Oh ! no , that is clear enough . One can guess what will happen there . He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe . What a very good - looking man ! """
Captain Wentworth	"Yes , and Miss Atkinson , who dined with him once at the Wallises , says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with . """
Captain Wentworth	"She is pretty , I think ; Anne Elliot ; very pretty , when one comes to look at her . It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister . """
Captain Wentworth	"That was in the year six ; """
Captain Wentworth	"That happened before I went to sea in the year six , """
Captain Wentworth	"Your first was the Asp , I remember ; we will look for the Asp . """
Captain Wentworth	"You will not find her there . Quite worn out and broken up . I was the last man who commanded her . Hardly fit for service then . Reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so I was sent off to the West Indies . """
Captain Wentworth	"The Admiralty , """
Captain Wentworth	"entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed . But they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed . """
Captain Wentworth	"I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ; """
Captain Wentworth	"To be sure you did . What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ? If a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again . """
Captain Wentworth	"I knew pretty well what she was before that day ; """
Captain Wentworth	"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself . Ah ! she was a dear old Asp to me . She did all that I wanted . I knew she would . I knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted . I brought her into Plymouth ; and here another instance of luck . We had not been six hours in the Sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time ; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition . Four - and - twenty hours later , and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth , in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me . """
Captain Wentworth	"Oh ! but , Charles , tell Captain Wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . """
Captain Wentworth	"Ah ! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia ! How fast I made money in her . A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands . Poor Harville , sister ! You know how much he wanted money : worse than myself . He had a wife . Excellent fellow . I shall never forget his happiness . He felt it all , so much for her sake . I wished for him again the next summer , when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean . """
Captain Wentworth	"If you had been a week later at Lisbon , last spring , Frederick , you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters . """
Captain Wentworth	"Should I ? I am glad I was not a week later then . """
Captain Wentworth	"But , if I know myself , """
Captain Wentworth	"this is from no want of gallantry towards them . It is rather from feeling how impossible it is , with all one 's efforts , and all one 's sacrifices , to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have . There can be no want of gallantry , Admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do . I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it . """
Captain Wentworth	"Oh ! Frederick ! But I can not believe it of you . --All idle refinement ! --Women may be as comfortable on board , as in the best house in England . I believe I have lived as much on board as most women , and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man - of - war . I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at Kellynch Hall , """
Captain Wentworth	"Nothing to the purpose , """
Captain Wentworth	"You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board . """
Captain Wentworth	"But you , yourself , brought Mrs Harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from Portsmouth to Plymouth . Where was this superfine , extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ? """
Captain Wentworth	"All merged in my friendship , Sophia . I would assist any brother officer 's wife that I could , and I would bring anything of Harville 's from the world 's end , if he wanted it . But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself . """
Captain Wentworth	"Depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable . """
Captain Wentworth	"I might not like them the better for that perhaps . Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board . """
Captain Wentworth	"My dear Frederick , you are talking quite idly . Pray , what would become of us poor sailors ' wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ? """
Captain Wentworth	"My feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth . """
Captain Wentworth	"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures . We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days . """
Captain Wentworth	"Ah ! my dear , """
Captain Wentworth	"when he had got a wife , he will sing a different tune . When he is married , if we have the good luck to live to another war , we shall see him do as you and I , and a great many others , have done . We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife . """
Captain Wentworth	"Ay , that we shall . """
Captain Wentworth	"Now I have done , """
Captain Wentworth	"When once married people begin to attack me with,--`Oh ! you will think very differently , when you are married . ' I can only say , ` No , I shall not ; ' and then they say again , ` Yes , you will , ' and there is an end of it . """
Captain Wentworth	"Pretty well , ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more . I have crossed the Atlantic four times , and have been once to the East Indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : Cork , and Lisbon , and Gibraltar . But I never went beyond the Streights , and never was in the West Indies . We do not call Bermuda or Bahama , you know , the West Indies . """
Captain Wentworth	"There is nothing so bad as a separation . I am quite of your opinion . I know what it is , for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes , and I am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again . """
Captain Wentworth	"Oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing . She had rather play . She is never tired of playing . """
Captain Wentworth	"the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour . """
Captain Wentworth	"Oh ! no , indeed , Charles , I can not bear to have you go away . Only think if anything should happen ? """
Captain Wentworth	"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm-- of the shock . You will not be hysterical again . I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us . I perfectly understand Mr Robinson 's directions , and have no fears ; and indeed , Mary , I can not wonder at your husband . Nursing does not belong to a man ; it is not his province . A sick child is always the mother 's property : her own feelings generally make it so . """
Captain Wentworth	"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I can not be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about . I have not nerves for the sort of thing . """
Captain Wentworth	"But , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ? """
Captain Wentworth	"Yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not I ? Jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was . I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come . I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is . I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day . """
Captain Wentworth	"Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband . Leave little Charles to my care . Mr and Mrs Musgrove can not think it wrong while I remain with him . """
Captain Wentworth	"That is the woman I want , """
Captain Wentworth	"Ay , a very bad business indeed . A new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress 's head , is not it , Miss Elliot ? This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! """
Captain Wentworth	"Now , this must be very bad for you , """
Captain Wentworth	"to be coming and finding us here . I had not recollected it before , I declare , but it must be very bad . But now , do not stand upon ceremony . Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it . """
Captain Wentworth	"you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler 's room . Ay , so it always is , I believe . One man 's ways may be as good as another 's , but we all like our own best . And so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . """
Captain Wentworth	"The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft 's , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place . The breakfast - room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter . And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this . Pray say so , with my compliments . He will be glad to hear it . """
Louisa Musgrove	"but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . """

Louisa Musgrove	"You were a good while at Lyme , I think ? """
Louisa Musgrove	"About a fortnight . I could not leave it till Louisa 's doing well was quite ascertained . I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace .

I walked and rode a great deal ; and the more I saw , the more I found to admire . """

If I had such a memory as Benwick , I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman 's inconstancy .

Captain Harville	"Ah ! """
Captain Harville	"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , ` God knows whether we ever meet again ! ' And then , if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth 's absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ` They can not be here till such a day , ' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if Heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still ! If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence ! I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts ! """
Captain Harville	"You are a good soul , """
Captain Harville	"Good morning , God bless you ! """
Captain Harville	"He found too late , in short , that he had entangled himself ; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all , he must regard himself as bound to her , if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed . It determined him to leave Lyme , and await her complete recovery elsewhere . He would gladly weaken , by any fair means , whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist ; and he went , therefore , to his brother 's , meaning after a while to return to Kellynch , and act as circumstances might require . """
Captain Harville	"said he , """
Captain Harville	"Anne smiled , and let it pass . It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach . It is something for a woman to be assured , in her eight - and - twentieth year , that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth ; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne , by comparing it with former words , and feeling it to be the result , not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment . He had remained in Shropshire , lamenting the blindness of his own pride , and the blunders of his own calculations , till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick . """
Captain Harville	"said he , """
Captain Harville	"Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said , but the concert still more . That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments . The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him : the moment of Mr Elliot 's appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy . """
Captain Harville	""""
Captain Harville	"he replied , """
Captain Harville	""""
Captain Harville	""""
Captain Harville	"At last Anne was at home again , and happier than any one in that house could have conceived . All the surprise and suspense , and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation , she re - entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last . An interval of meditation , serious and grateful , was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high - wrought felicity ; and she went to her room , and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment . The evening came , the drawing - rooms were lighted up , the company assembled . It was but a card party , it was but a mixture of those who had never met before , and those who met too often ; a commonplace business , too numerous for intimacy , too small for variety ; but Anne had never found an evening shorter . Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness , and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for , she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her . Mr Elliot was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him . The Wallises , she had amusement in understanding them . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret -- they would soon be innoxious cousins to her . She cared not for Mrs Clay , and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . With the Musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with Captain Harville , the kind - hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with Lady Russell , attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with Admiral and Mrs Croft , everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with Captain Wentworth , some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there . It was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said-- """
Captain Harville	"He looked at her , looked at Lady Russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation-- """
Captain Harville	""""
Captain Harville	"was all her answer ; but the accent was decisive enough . """
Captain Harville	"he cried , """
Captain Harville	"he added , with a smile . """
Captain Harville	
Captain Benwick	""""
Captain Benwick	"said Anne , """
Captain Benwick	"This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , """
Captain Benwick	"Miss Elliot , """
Captain Benwick	"you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much . I wish he could have such company oftener . It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ? We can not part . """
Captain Benwick	"Oh ! he talks of you , """
Captain Benwick	"I declare , Charles , I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there . I declare , Anne , he never talks of you at all . """
William Elliot	"Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; """
William Elliot	"You have not been long enough in Bath , """
William Elliot	"to enjoy the evening parties of the place . """
William Elliot	"Oh ! no . The usual character of them has nothing for me . I am no card - player . """
William Elliot	"It is a period , indeed ! Eight years and a half is a period . """
William Elliot	"Miss Elliot at home , """
William Elliot	"Oh ! yes , perhaps , it had been Mr Elliot . They did not know . It might be him , perhaps . """
William Elliot	"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them ! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should ! """
William Elliot	"The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day . """
William Elliot	"Oh ! no , that must have been quite accidental . In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas . """
William Elliot	"A knock at the door ! and so late ! It was ten o'clock . Could it be Mr Elliot ? They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent . It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did . They could think of no one else . Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot 's knock . """
William Elliot	"Well , it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn , which he had adopted , when quite a young man , on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious . """
William Elliot	"But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone : he knew it ; he was soon diffused again among the others , and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme . His enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place . Having alluded to """
William Elliot	"he must hear the whole . When he questioned , Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt . She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it . He staid an hour with them . The elegant little clock on the mantel- piece had struck """
William Elliot	and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale , before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long . Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well !
William Elliot	"True , true , a surgeon this instant , """
William Elliot	"Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ? He knows where a surgeon is to be found . """
William Elliot	"Perhaps , """
William Elliot	"I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . """
William Elliot	"Indeed ! How so ? You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family . """
William Elliot	"That must not be any reason , indeed . I assure you I feel it none . She is nothing to me , compared with you ; """
William Elliot	"Can this be Mr Elliot ? """
William Elliot	""""
William Elliot	"said he gently , """
William Elliot	""""
William Elliot	""""
William Elliot	"continued Mrs Smith , triumphantly , """
William Elliot	""""
William Elliot	"said Anne , after a little thoughtfulness . """
William Elliot	"But Mr Elliot was not done with . Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife 's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him . Mr Elliot , raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self - indulgence he had become a prudent man ) , and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend 's probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined . The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it . They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that Mr Elliot 's had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known . With a confidence in Mr Elliot 's regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but Mr Elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation . Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her . It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity ; and Anne felt , at some moments , that no flagrant open crime could have been worse . She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence . Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend 's usual state of mind . There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation . She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich . But there was nobody to stir in it . Mr Elliot would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money . She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel , and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law . This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means . To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear . It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne 's good offices with Mr Elliot . She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne 's feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot 's character would allow , when Anne 's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith 's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation . """
William Elliot	""""
William Elliot	Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell ! And under such a supposition , which would have been most miserable , when time had disclosed all , too late ? It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved .
Sir Walter Elliot	"and pacing the room , he observed sarcastically-- "" There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine ,"
Sir Walter Elliot	"And mine , """
Sir Walter Elliot	"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove """
Sir Walter Elliot	"must lament his being very much under - hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse . Mr Elliot appeared to think that he ( Sir Walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; """
Sir Walter Elliot	"not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him . He did not mean to complain , however . Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . """
Sir Walter Elliot	"He longed to see her . He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets . The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women . He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women , but the number of the plain was out of all proportion . He had frequently observed , as he walked , that one handsome face would be followed by thirty , or five - and - thirty frights ; and once , as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street , he had counted eighty - seven women go by , one after another , without there being a tolerable face among them . It had been a frosty morning , to be sure , a sharp frost , which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of . But still , there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath ; and as for the men ! they were infinitely worse . Such scarecrows as the streets were full of ! It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable , by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced . He had never walked anywhere arm - in - arm with Colonel Wallis ( who was a fine military figure , though sandy - haired ) without observing that every woman 's eye was upon him ; every woman 's eye was sure to be upon Colonel Wallis . """
Sir Walter Elliot	"How is Mary looking ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	"What is this ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	""""
Sir Walter Elliot	"He would be a very lucky man , Shepherd , """
Sir Walter Elliot	"that 's all I have to remark . A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him ; rather the greatest prize of all , let him have taken ever so many before ; hey , Shepherd ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description . """
Sir Walter Elliot	"As to all that , """
Sir Walter Elliot	"supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing . I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier . """
Sir Walter Elliot	"The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it . """
Sir Walter Elliot	"Indeed ! """
Sir Walter Elliot	"It seemed as if Mr Shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter 's good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent . By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make , Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold , Mr Shepherd observed , Sir Walter 's concerns could not be kept a secret,)-- accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let , and understanding his ( Mr Shepherd 's ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given Mr Shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant .

Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour 's leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one 's species better .

Mrs. Smith	"there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late . """
Mrs. Smith	"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis , however . She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high - priced things I have in hand now . """
Mrs. Smith	"replied Anne ; """
Mrs. Smith	"Sir Henry Russell 's widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot . A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith ! Such a name ! """
Mrs. Smith	"Lady Elliot """
Mrs. Smith	"By all means , """
Mrs. Smith	"only tell me all about it , when you do come . Who is your party ? """
Mrs. Smith	"Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to - morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you . """
Mrs. Smith	"The little Durands were there , I conclude , """
Mrs. Smith	"with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed . They never miss a concert . """
Mrs. Smith	"And such being the case , """
Mrs. Smith	"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning . It is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time . """
Mrs. Smith	"Pray , """
Mrs. Smith	"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ? """
Mrs. Smith	"I have been a good deal acquainted with him , """
Mrs. Smith	"but it seems worn out now . It is a great while since we met . """
Mrs. Smith	"I was not at all aware of this . You never mentioned it before . Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . """
Mrs. Smith	"To confess the truth , """
Mrs. Smith	"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have . I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot . I want your interest with him . He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done . """
Mrs. Smith	"Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him . Do not forget me when you are married , that 's all . Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps . Ninety - nine out of a hundred would do the same . Of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me . Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy . Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman . Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin . """
Mrs. Smith	"It first came into my head , """
Mrs. Smith	"upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way . But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago . """
Mrs. Smith	"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years , """
Mrs. Smith	"I know it all , I know it all , """
Mrs. Smith	"Mr Elliot , """
Mrs. Smith	"at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage . He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I can not decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you . He told me the whole story . He had no concealments with me . It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other . """
Mrs. Smith	"This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him . The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine . But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it . """
Mrs. Smith	"Charles Smith , Esq . Tunbridge Wells , """
Mrs. Smith	"Dear Smith,--I have received yours . Your kindness almost overpowers me . I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three - and - twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it . At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again . Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss. They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer . The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough . If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . He is worse than last year . """
Mrs. Smith	"Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father . She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say-- """

Mrs. Smith	"replied Mrs Smith . """
Mrs. Smith	"was Mrs Smith 's reply , """
Mr. Shepherd	"I must take leave to observe , Sir Walter , """
Mr. Shepherd	"that the present juncture is much in our favour . This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore . They will be all wanting a home . Could not be a better time , Sir Walter , for having a choice of tenants , very responsible tenants . Many a noble fortune has been made during the war . If a rich admiral were to come in our way , Sir Walter-- """
Mr. Shepherd	"I presume to observe , Sir Walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with . Therefore , Sir Walter , what I would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; I , John Shepherd , might conceal any family - matters that I chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much I venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as I was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying . """
Mr. Shepherd	"In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . Your interest , Sir Walter , is in pretty safe hands . Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights . I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him . """
Mr. Shepherd	"Very true , very true . What Miss Anne says , is very true , """
Mr. Shepherd	"Oh ! certainly , """
Mr. Shepherd	"Yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; I have two strong grounds of objection to it . First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man 's youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . I have observed it all my life . A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ` In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? ' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ) . ` Old fellow ! ' cried Sir Basil , ` it is Admiral Baldwin . What do you take his age to be ? ' ` Sixty , ' said I , ` or perhaps sixty - two . ' ` Forty , ' replied Sir Basil , ` forty , and no more . ' Picture to yourselves my amazement ; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin . I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea - faring life can do ; but to a degree , I know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen . It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach Admiral Baldwin 's age . """
Mr. Shepherd	"But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot , that she did not hear the appeal . """
Mr. Shepherd	""""
Mr. Shepherd	""""
Mr. Shepherd	"As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter 's estimate of the dues of a tenant . It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen . Sir Walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than Admiral Croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer . So far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the Admiral 's situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high . """
Mr. Shepherd	
Mr. Shepherd	"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , """
Mr. Shepherd	"in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side . It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support . In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household . """

Admiral Croft	"Anne looked down to hide her smile . """
Admiral Croft	"was Sir Walter 's cold suspicious inquiry . Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman 's family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added-- """
Admiral Croft	"I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton . The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . """
Admiral Croft	"Phoo ! phoo ! """
Admiral Croft	"what stuff these young fellows talk ! Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day . For an old built sloop , you would not see her equal . Lucky fellow to get her ! He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time . Lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his . """
Mrs. Musgrove	"Good heavens , Charles ! how can you think of such a thing ? Take a box for to - morrow night ! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to - morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter , and Mr Elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ? How can you be so forgetful ? """
Mrs. Musgrove	"And so , ma'am , all these thing considered , """
Mrs. Musgrove	"though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them . At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement . """
Mrs. Musgrove	"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement . I always think that no mutual-- """
Mrs. Musgrove	"Oh ! dear Mrs Croft , """
Mrs. Musgrove	"there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement . It is what I always protested against for my children . It is all very well , I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement-- """
Mrs. Musgrove	"And so then , I suppose , """
Mrs. Musgrove	"so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy . Charles , my dear , """
Mrs. Musgrove	"And I am sure , Sir . """
Mrs. Musgrove	"it was a lucky day for us , when you were put captain into that ship . We shall never forget what you did . """
Mrs. Musgrove	"My brother , """
Mrs. Musgrove	"mamma is thinking of poor Richard . """
Mrs. Musgrove	"Poor dear fellow ! """
Mrs. Musgrove	"he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care ! Ah ! it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you . I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . """
Mrs. Musgrove	"What a great traveller you must have been , ma'am ! """
Mrs. Musgrove	"Aye , to be sure . Yes , indeed , oh yes ! I am quite of your opinion , Mrs Croft , """
Henrietta Musgrove	""""
Henrietta Musgrove	"replied Mary . """
Henrietta Musgrove	"It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed -- very sad for herself and her children . """
Henrietta Musgrove	"Her husband , however , would not agree with her here ; for besides having a regard for his cousin , Charles Hayter was an eldest son , and he saw things as an eldest son himself . """
Henrietta Musgrove	"was therefore his answer . """
Henrietta Musgrove	"A dinner at Mr Musgrove 's had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little Charles . She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening . As to Captain Wentworth 's views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta . Either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good - humoured wife . With regard to Charles Hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well - meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alternation could not be understood too soon . Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin 's behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause . He had been absent only two Sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of Uppercross instead . It had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that Dr Shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it . The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley 's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta . When he came back , alas ! the zeal of the business was gone by . Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley : she was at a window , looking out for Captain Wentworth ; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give , and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation . """
Henrietta Musgrove	"was silent . She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa , and remain there to satisfy her patient ; and thus they continued a few minutes , when , to her very great satisfaction , she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule . She hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy -- Charles Hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne . She only attempted to say , """
Henrietta Musgrove	"Captain Wentworth , however , came from his window , apparently not ill - disposed for conversation ; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window . Another minute brought another addition . The younger boy , a remarkable stout , forward child , of two years old , having got the door opened for him by some one without , made his determined appearance among them , and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on , and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away . There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about Charles , she could not shake him off . She spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain . Once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly . """
Henrietta Musgrove	""""
Henrietta Musgrove	"cried Charles Hayter , """
Henrietta Musgrove	and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself . But neither Charles Hayter 's feelings , nor anybody 's feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own . She was ashamed of herself , quite ashamed of being so nervous , so overcome by such a trifle ; but so it was , and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her .
Mrs. Clay	"Quite delightful ! """
Mrs. Clay	"Oh ! I lay no embargo on any body 's words . If you will have such ideas ! But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men . """
Mrs. Clay	"My dear Miss Elliot ! """
Mrs. Clay	"They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune , """
Mrs. Clay	"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant . I have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways ! These valuable pictures of yours , Sir Walter , if you chose to leave them , would be perfectly safe . Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of ! The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now . You need not be afraid , Miss Elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected . """
Mrs. Clay	"Nay , Sir Walter , """
Mrs. Clay	"this is being severe indeed . Have a little mercy on the poor men . We are not all born to be handsome . The sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; I have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth . But then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ? Soldiers , in active service , are not at all better off : and even in the quieter professions , there is a toil and a labour of the mind , if not of the body , which seldom leaves a man 's looks to the natural effect of time . The lawyer plods , quite care - worn ; the physician is up at all hours , and travelling in all weather ; and even the clergyman-- """
