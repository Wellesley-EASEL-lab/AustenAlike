Catherine Morland	The Hare and Many Friends ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine grows quite a good - looking girl — she is almost pretty to - day , ”
Catherine Morland	bear about the mockery of woe . ”
Catherine Morland	Many a flower is born to blush unseen , “ And waste its fragrance on the desert air . ”
Catherine Morland	It is a delightful task “ To teach the young idea how to shoot . ”
Catherine Morland	Trifles light as air , “ Are , to the jealous , confirmation strong , “ As proofs of Holy Writ . ”
Catherine Morland	The poor beetle , which we tread upon , “ In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great “ As when a giant dies . ”
Catherine Morland	like Patience on a monument “ Smiling at Grief . ”
Catherine Morland	How came you here ? How came you up that staircase ? ”
Catherine Morland	How came I up that staircase ! ”
Catherine Morland	Because it is my nearest way from the stable - yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? ”
Catherine Morland	I have been , ”
Catherine Morland	to see your mother ’s room . ”
Catherine Morland	I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me . You look pale . I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs . Perhaps you did not know — you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , I was not . You have had a very fine day for your ride . ”
Catherine Morland	Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh no ! she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday — and we were coming here to these rooms — but only , ”
Catherine Morland	your father was with us . ”
Catherine Morland	And that prevented you , ”
Catherine Morland	Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , I only wanted to see — Is not it very late ? I must go and dress . ”
Catherine Morland	Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , and I am very much surprised . Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly . ”
Catherine Morland	Promised so faithfully ! a faithful promise ! that puzzles me . I have heard of a faithful performance . But a faithful promise — the fidelity of promising ! it is a power little worth knowing , however , since it can deceive and pain you . My mother ’s room is very commodious , is it not ? Large and cheerful - looking , and the dressing - closets so well disposed ! It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house , and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own . She sent you to look at it , I suppose ? ”
Catherine Morland	No . ”
Catherine Morland	It has been your own doing entirely ? ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , a great deal . That is — no , not much , but what she did say was very interesting . Her dying so suddenly ”
Catherine Morland	But your father , ”
Catherine Morland	was _ he _ afflicted ? ”
Catherine Morland	For a time , greatly so . You have erred in supposing him not attached to her . He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to — we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition — and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did . His value of her was sincere ; and , if not permanently , he was truly afflicted by her death . ”
Catherine Morland	I am very glad of it , ”
Catherine Morland	it would have been very shocking ! ”
Catherine Morland	If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to — Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained . What have you been judging from ? Remember the country and the age in which we live . Remember that we are English , that we are Christians . Consult your own understanding , your own sense of the probable , your own observation of what is passing around you . Does our education prepare us for such atrocities ? Do our laws connive at them ? Could they be perpetrated without being known , in a country like this , where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing , where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies , and where roads and newspapers lay everything open ? Dearest Miss Morland , what ideas have you been admitting ? ”
Catherine Morland	But he will tell only half of it . ”
Catherine Morland	A quarter would be enough . ”
Catherine Morland	And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting , and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , well , we will take our chance some one of those days . There is no need to fix . You are not to put yourself at all out of your way . Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough . I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor ’s table . Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come on Monday ; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me . I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning ; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club . I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it . They are a set of very worthy men . They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year ; and I dine with them whenever I can . Tuesday , therefore , we may say is out of the question . But on Wednesday , I think , Henry , you may expect us ; and we shall be with you early , that we may have time to look about us . Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston , I suppose ; we shall be in the carriage by ten ; so , about a quarter before one on Wednesday , you may look for us . ”
Catherine Morland	I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour . Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday , which bad weather , or twenty other causes , may prevent , I must go away directly , two days before I intended it . ”
Catherine Morland	Go away ! ”
Catherine Morland	And why ? ”
Catherine Morland	Why ! how can you ask the question ? Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits , because I must go and prepare a dinner for you , to be sure . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! not seriously ! ”
Catherine Morland	Aye , and sadly too — for I had much rather stay . ”
Catherine Morland	But how can you think of such a thing , after what the General said ? When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble , because _ anything _ would do . ”
Catherine Morland	I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister ’s account and mine . You must know it to be so ; and the General made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . ”
Catherine Morland	I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own . Good - bye . As to - morrow is Sunday , Eleanor , I shall not return . ”
Catherine Morland	We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger — we are considering it as a mere parsonage , small and confined , we allow , but decent , perhaps , and habitable ; and altogether not inferior to the generality ; or , in other words , I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good . It may admit of improvement , however . Far be it from me to say otherwise ; and anything in reason — a bow thrown out , perhaps — though , between ourselves , if there is one thing more than another my aversion , it is a patched - on bow . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! why do not you fit up this room , Mr. Tilney ? What a pity not to have it fitted up ! it is the prettiest room I ever saw ; it is the prettiest room in the world ! ”
Catherine Morland	Well , if it was my house , I should never sit anywhere else . Oh ! what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees — apple trees , too ! it is the prettiest cottage ! ”
Catherine Morland	You like it — you approve it as an object — it is enough . Henry , remember that Robinson is spoken to about it . The cottage remains . ”
Catherine Morland	for all our intimacy ! she must think me an idiot , or she could not have written so ; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her . I see what she has been about . She is a vain coquette , and her tricks have not answered . I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her . ” “
Catherine Morland	we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose — consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . ” “
Catherine Morland	is very right that you should stand by your brother . ” “
Catherine Morland	it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , ”
Catherine Morland	I can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , ”
Catherine Morland	but why not do it civilly ? ”
Catherine Morland	No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . ”
Catherine Morland	If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy . It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years ; and then what a pleasure it will be ! ”
Catherine Morland	We are sorry for him , ”
Catherine Morland	She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house . Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again ! and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , but _ that _ did not last long , ”
Catherine Morland	Very true : we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe , and then we wanted for nothing . My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ? I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since . Do you remember that evening ? ”
Catherine Morland	Do I ! oh ! perfectly . ”
Catherine Morland	It was very agreeable , was not it ? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable . I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure . I remember I had my favourite gown on . ”
Catherine Morland	her head did not run upon Bath — much . ”
Catherine Morland	Then you are fretting about General Tilney , and that is very simple of you ; for ten to one whether you ever see him again . You should never fret about trifles . ”
Catherine Morland	I am sure I do not care about the bread . It is all the same to me what I eat . ”
Catherine Morland	There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject , about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance — The Mirror , I think . I will look it out for you some day or other , because I am sure it will do you good . ”
Catherine Morland	But it was not so bad as that , Isabella ; there was no superciliousness ; she was very civil . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , do n’t defend her ! and then the brother , he , who had appeared so attached to you ! good heavens ! well , some people ’s feelings are incomprehensible . And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day ? ”
Catherine Morland	I do not say so ; but he did not seem in good spirits . ”
Catherine Morland	How contemptible ! of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion . Let me entreat you never to think of him again , my dear Catherine ; indeed he is unworthy of you . ”
Catherine Morland	Unworthy ! i do not suppose he ever thinks of me . ”
Catherine Morland	That is exactly what I say ; he never thinks of you . Such fickleness ! Oh ! how different to your brother and to mine ! i really believe John has the most constant heart . ”
Catherine Morland	But as for General Tilney , I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention ; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! i know no harm of him ; I do not suspect him of pride . I believe he is a very gentleman - like man . John thinks very well of him , and John ’s judgment — ”
Catherine Morland	Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . ”
Catherine Morland	And must I go ? ”
Catherine Morland	Do not you intend it ? I thought it was all settled . ”
Catherine Morland	Nay , since you make such a point of it , I can refuse you nothing . But do not insist upon my being very agreeable , for my heart , you know , will be some forty miles off . And as for dancing , do not mention it , I beg ; _ that _ is quite out of the question . Charles Hodges will plague me to death , I dare say ; but I shall cut him very short . Ten to one but he guesses the reason , and that is exactly what I want to avoid , so I shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself . ”
Catherine Morland	How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people ’s actions . ”
Catherine Morland	Why ? What do you mean ? ”
Catherine Morland	With you , it is not , How is such a one likely to be influenced , What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person ’s feelings , age , situation , and probable habits of life considered — but , How should _ I _ be influenced , What would be _ my _ inducement in acting so and so ? ”
Catherine Morland	I do not understand you . ”
Catherine Morland	Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . ”
Catherine Morland	Me ? Yes ; I can not speak well enough to be unintelligible . ”
Catherine Morland	Bravo ! an excellent satire on modern language . ”
Catherine Morland	But pray tell me what you mean . ”
Catherine Morland	Shall I indeed ? Do you really desire it ? But you are not aware of the consequences ; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment , and certainly bring on a disagreement between us . ”
Catherine Morland	No , no ; it shall not do either ; I am not afraid . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
Catherine Morland	I can not think how it could happen ! isabella was so determined not to dance . ”
Catherine Morland	And did Isabella never change her mind before ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! but , because — And your brother ! after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ”
Catherine Morland	I can not take surprise to myself on that head . You bid me be surprised on your friend ’s account , and therefore I am ; but as for my brother , his conduct in the business , I must own , has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to . The fairness of your friend was an open attraction ; her firmness , you know , could only be understood by yourself . ”
Catherine Morland	You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . ”
Catherine Morland	It is as much as should be said of anyone . To be always firm must be to be often obstinate . When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! my dear ! it would have looked so particular ; and you know how I abhor doing that . I refused him as long as I possibly could , but he would take no denial . You have no idea how he pressed me . I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner — but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me . Oh ! such nonsense ! i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so — and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up . Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening . I am so glad it is over ! my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense : and then , being such a smart young fellow , I saw every eye was upon us . ”
Catherine Morland	He is very handsome indeed . ”
Catherine Morland	Handsome ! yes , I suppose he may . I dare say people would admire him in general ; but he is not at all in my style of beauty . I hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man . However , he is very well . Amazingly conceited , I am sure . I took him down several times , you know , in my way . ”
Catherine Morland	It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life . For myself , it is nothing ; I never think of myself . ”
Catherine Morland	I know you never do , my dear ; and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you . There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child — but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things . Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome , you know . I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
Catherine Morland	Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure . But everybody has their failing , you know , and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money . ”
Catherine Morland	I am very sure , ”
Catherine Morland	that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford . ”
Catherine Morland	As to that , my sweet Catherine , there can not be a doubt , and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me . It is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits ; I hate money ; and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year , I should not have a wish unsatisfied . Ah ! my Catherine , you have found me out . There ’s the sting . The long , long , endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living . ”
Catherine Morland	, my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial . He has been disappointed of some friends ’ arrival whom he expected to meet here , and as he is now pretty well , is in a hurry to get home . ” “
Catherine Morland	, Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ” “
Catherine Morland	was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ” “
Catherine Morland	, proceed by all means . I know how much your heart is in it . My daughter , Miss Morland , ” he
Catherine Morland	will write home directly , ” said
Catherine Morland	if they do not object , as I dare say they will not — ” General
Catherine Morland	they can consent to part with you , ” said
Catherine Morland	may expect philosophy from all the world . ” Miss
Catherine Morland	Oh , heavens ! my beloved Catherine , have I got you at last ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , ”
Catherine Morland	he is not here ; I can not see him anywhere . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , horrid ! am I never to be acquainted with him ? How do you like my gown ? I think it does not look amiss ; the sleeves were entirely my own thought . Do you know , I get so immoderately sick of Bath ; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that , though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks , we would not live here for millions . We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place ; really , our opinions were so exactly the same , it was quite ridiculous ! there was not a single point in which we differed ; I would not have had you by for the world ; you are such a sly thing , I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it . ”
Catherine Morland	No , indeed I should not . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , yes you would indeed ; I know you better than you know yourself . You would have told us that we seemed born for each other , or some nonsense of that kind , which would have distressed me beyond conception ; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses ; I would not have had you by for the world . ”
Catherine Morland	Indeed you do me injustice ; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account ; and besides , I am sure it would never have entered my head . ”
Catherine Morland	How well your brother dances ! ”
Catherine Morland	Henry ! ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , he does dance very well . ”
Catherine Morland	He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening , when he saw me sitting down . But I really had been engaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe . ”
Catherine Morland	You can not think , ”
Catherine Morland	how surprised I was to see him again . I felt so sure of his being quite gone away . ”
Catherine Morland	When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before , he was in Bath but for a couple of days . He came only to engage lodgings for us . ”
Catherine Morland	_ That _ never occurred to me ; and of course , not seeing him anywhere , I thought he must be gone . Was not the young lady he danced with on Monday a Miss Smith ? ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes . ”
Catherine Morland	I dare say she was very glad to dance . Do you think her pretty ? ”
Catherine Morland	Not very . ”
Catherine Morland	He never comes to the pump - room , I suppose ? ”
Catherine Morland	I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon , ”
Catherine Morland	Perhaps we — Yes , I think we certainly shall . ”
Catherine Morland	What is the meaning of this ? I thought you and I were to dance together . ”
Catherine Morland	I wonder you should think so , for you never asked me . ”
Catherine Morland	That is a good one , by Jove ! i asked you as soon as I came into the room , and I was just going to ask you again , but when I turned round , you were gone ! this is a cursed shabby trick ! i only came for the sake of dancing with _ you _ , and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday . Yes ; I remember , I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak . And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room ; and when they see you standing up with somebody else , they will quiz me famously . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , no ; they will never think of _ me _ , after such a description as that . ”
Catherine Morland	By heavens , if they do not , I will kick them out of the room for blockheads . What chap have you there ? ”
Catherine Morland	Tilney , ”
Catherine Morland	Hum — I do not know him . A good figure of a man ; well put together . Does he want a horse ? Here is a friend of mine , Sam Fletcher , has got one to sell that would suit anybody . A famous clever animal for the road — only forty guineas . I had fifty minds to buy it myself , for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one ; but it would not answer my purpose , it would not do for the field . I would give any money for a real good hunter . I have three now , the best that ever were backed . I would not take eight hundred guineas for them . Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire , against the next season . It is so d — — uncomfortable , living at an inn . ”
Catherine Morland	But they are such very different things ! ”
Catherine Morland	— That you think they can not be compared together . ”
Catherine Morland	To be sure not . People that marry can never part , but must go and keep house together . People that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour . ”
Catherine Morland	And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing . Taken in that light certainly , their resemblance is not striking ; but I think I could place them in such a view . You will allow , that in both , man has the advantage of choice , woman only the power of refusal ; that in both , it is an engagement between man and woman , formed for the advantage of each ; and that when once entered into , they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution ; that it is their duty , each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere , and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours , or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else . You will allow all this ? ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , to be sure , as you state it , all this sounds very well ; but still they are so very different . I can not look upon them at all in the same light , nor think the same duties belong to them . ”
Catherine Morland	In one respect , there certainly is a difference . In marriage , the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman , the woman to make the home agreeable to the man ; he is to purvey , and she is to smile . But in dancing , their duties are exactly changed ; the agreeableness , the compliance are expected from him , while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water . _ That _ , I suppose , was the difference of duties which struck you , as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison . ”
Catherine Morland	No , indeed , I never thought of that . ”
Catherine Morland	Then I am quite at a loss . One thing , however , I must observe . This disposition on your side is rather alarming . You totally disallow any similarity in the obligations ; and may I not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish ? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return , or if any other gentleman were to address you , there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose ? ”
Catherine Morland	Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother ’s , that if he talks to me , I must talk to him again ; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with . ”
Catherine Morland	And is that to be my only security ? Alas , alas ! ”
Catherine Morland	Nay , I am sure you can not have a better ; for if I do not know anybody , it is impossible for me to talk to them ; and , besides , I do not _ want _ to talk to anybody . ”
Catherine Morland	Now you have given me a security worth having ; and I shall proceed with courage . Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry before ? ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , quite — more so , indeed . ”
Catherine Morland	More so ! take care , or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time . You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks . ”
Catherine Morland	I do not think I should be tired , if I were to stay here six months . ”
Catherine Morland	Bath , compared with London , has little variety , and so everybody finds out every year . ‘ For six weeks , I allow Bath is pleasant enough ; but beyond _ that _ , it is the most tiresome place in the world . ’ You would be told so by people of all descriptions , who come regularly every winter , lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve , and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , other people must judge for themselves , and those who go to London may think nothing of Bath . But I , who live in a small retired village in the country , can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home ; for here are a variety of amusements , a variety of things to be seen and done all day long , which I can know nothing of there . ”
Catherine Morland	You are not fond of the country . ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , I am . I have always lived there , and always been very happy . But certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath life . One day in the country is exactly like another . ”
Catherine Morland	But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country . ”
Catherine Morland	Do I ? ”
Catherine Morland	Do you not ? ”
Catherine Morland	I do not believe there is much difference . ”
Catherine Morland	Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long . ”
Catherine Morland	And so I am at home — only I do not find so much of it . I walk about here , and so I do there ; but here I see a variety of people in every street , and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen . ”
Catherine Morland	Only go and call on Mrs. Allen ! ”
Catherine Morland	What a picture of intellectual poverty ! however , when you sink into this abyss again , you will have more to say . You will be able to talk of Bath , and of all that you did here . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! yes . I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs. Allen , or anybody else . I really believe I shall always be talking of Bath , when I am at home again — I _ do _ like it so very much . If I could but have Papa and Mamma , and the rest of them here , I suppose I should be too happy ! james ’s coming ( my eldest brother ) is quite delightful — and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already . Oh ! who can ever be tired of Bath ? ”
Catherine Morland	Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do . But papas and mammas , and brothers , and intimate friends are a good deal gone by , to most of the frequenters of Bath — and the honest relish of balls and plays , and everyday sights , is past with them . ”
Catherine Morland	I shall like it , ”
Catherine Morland	beyond anything in the world ; and do not let us put it off — let us go to - morrow . ”
Catherine Morland	had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day , if the clouds would only go off , and the sun keep out . ” At
Catherine Morland	! dear , I do believe it will be wet , ” broke
Catherine Morland	thought how it would be , ” said
Catherine Morland	walk for me to - day , ” sighed
Catherine Morland	perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . ” “
Catherine Morland	it may , but then , my dear , it will be so dirty . ” “
Catherine Morland	! that will not signify ; I never mind dirt . ” “
Catherine Morland	it does indeed . If it keeps raining , the streets will be very wet . ” “
Catherine Morland	are four umbrellas up already . How I hate the sight of an umbrella ! ” “
Catherine Morland	are disagreeable things to carry . I would much rather take a chair at any time . ” “
Catherine Morland	was such a nice - looking morning ! i felt so convinced it would be dry ! ” “
Catherine Morland	would have thought so indeed . There will be very few people in the pump - room , if it rains all the morning . I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable . ” The
Catherine Morland	will not be able to go , my dear . ” “
Catherine Morland	do not quite despair yet . I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve . This is just the time of day for it to clear up , and I do think it looks a little lighter . There , it is twenty minutes after twelve , and now I _ shall _ give it up entirely . Oh ! that we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho , or at least in Tuscany and the south of France!—the night that poor St. Aubin died!—such beautiful weather ! ” At
Catherine Morland	thought it would clear up . ” But
Catherine Morland	haste ! make haste ! ” as
Catherine Morland	on your hat this moment — there is no time to be lost — we are going to Bristol . How d’ye do , Mrs. Allen ? ” “
Catherine Morland	Bristol ! is not that a great way off ? But , however , I can not go with you to - day , because I am engaged ; I expect some friends every moment . ” This
Catherine Morland	doubt our being able to do so much , ” said
Catherine Morland	shall be able to do ten times more . Kingsweston ! aye , and Blaize Castle too , and anything else we can hear of ; but here is your sister says she will not go . ” “
Catherine Morland	Castle ! ” cried
Catherine Morland	is that ? ” “
Catherine Morland	finest place in England — worth going fifty miles at any time to see . ” “
Catherine Morland	, is it really a castle , an old castle ? ” “
Catherine Morland	oldest in the kingdom . ” “
Catherine Morland	is it like what one reads of ? ” “
Catherine Morland	— the very same . ” “
Catherine Morland	now really — are there towers and long galleries ? ” “
Catherine Morland	dozens . ” “
Catherine Morland	I should like to see it ; but I cannot — I can not go . ” “
Catherine Morland	go ! my beloved creature , what do you mean ? ” “
Catherine Morland	can not go , because”—looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella ’s smile—“I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk . They promised to come at twelve , only it rained ; but now , as it is so fine , I dare say they will be here soon . ” “
Catherine Morland	they indeed , ” cried
Catherine Morland	, as we turned into Broad Street , I saw them — does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts ? ” “
Catherine Morland	do not know indeed . ” “
Catherine Morland	, I know he does ; I saw him . You are talking of the man you danced with last night , are not you ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road , driving a smart - looking girl . ” “
Catherine Morland	is very odd ! but I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk . ” “
Catherine Morland	well they might , for I never saw so much dirt in my life . Walk ! You could no more walk than you could fly ! it has not been so dirty the whole winter ; it is ankle - deep everywhere . ” Isabella
Catherine Morland	should like to see the castle ; but may we go all over it ? May we go up every staircase , and into every suite of rooms ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, yes , every hole and corner . ” “
Catherine Morland	then , if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer , and call by and by ? ” “
Catherine Morland	yourself easy , there is no danger of that , for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback , that they were going as far as Wick Rocks . ” “
Catherine Morland	I will . Shall I go , Mrs. Allen ? ” “
Catherine Morland	as you please , my dear . ” “
Catherine Morland	, my dear , ” said
Catherine Morland	is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by ? ” “
Catherine Morland	? Where ? ” “
Catherine Morland	the right - hand pavement — she must be almost out of sight now . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	, stop , Mr. Thorpe , ” she
Catherine Morland	is Miss Tilney ; it is indeed . How could you tell me they were gone ? Stop , stop , I will get out this moment and go to them . ” But
Catherine Morland	, pray stop , Mr. Thorpe . I can not go on . I will not go on . I must go back to Miss Tilney . ” But
Catherine Morland	could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road ? I would not have had it happen so for the world . They must think it so strange , so rude of me ! to go by them , too , without saying a word ! you do not know how vexed I am ; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton , nor in anything else . I had rather , ten thousand times rather , get out now , and walk back to them . How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton ? ” Thorpe
Catherine Morland	your brother had not got such a d — — beast to drive , ” said
Catherine Morland	might have done it very well . My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour , if left to himself , and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken - winded jade ’s pace . Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own . ” “
Catherine Morland	, he is not , ” said
Catherine Morland	I pity the poor creatures that are going there ! how glad I am that I am not amongst them ! i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not ! they have not begun dancing yet . I would not be there for all the world . It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself . I dare say it will not be a very good ball . I know the Mitchells will not be there . I am sure I pity everybody that is . But I dare say , Mr. Morland , you long to be at it , do not you ? I am sure you do . Well , pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you . I dare say we could do very well without you ; but you men think yourselves of such consequence . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	not be so dull , my dearest creature , ” she
Catherine Morland	will quite break my heart . It was amazingly shocking , to be sure ; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame . Why were not they more punctual ? It was dirty , indeed , but what did that signify ? I am sure John and I should not have minded it . I never mind going through anything , where a friend is concerned ; that is my disposition , and John is just the same ; he has amazing strong feelings . Good heavens ! what a delightful hand you have got ! kings , I vow ! i never was so happy in my life ! i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself . ” And
Catherine Morland	But it was not so bad as that , Isabella ; there was no superciliousness ; she was very civil . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , do n’t defend her ! and then the brother , he , who had appeared so attached to you ! good heavens ! well , some people ’s feelings are incomprehensible . And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day ? ”
Catherine Morland	I do not say so ; but he did not seem in good spirits . ”
Catherine Morland	How contemptible ! of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion . Let me entreat you never to think of him again , my dear Catherine ; indeed he is unworthy of you . ”
Catherine Morland	Unworthy ! i do not suppose he ever thinks of me . ”
Catherine Morland	That is exactly what I say ; he never thinks of you . Such fickleness ! Oh ! how different to your brother and to mine ! i really believe John has the most constant heart . ”
Catherine Morland	But as for General Tilney , I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention ; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! i know no harm of him ; I do not suspect him of pride . I believe he is a very gentleman - like man . John thinks very well of him , and John ’s judgment — ”
Catherine Morland	Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . ”
Catherine Morland	And must I go ? ”
Catherine Morland	Do not you intend it ? I thought it was all settled . ”
Catherine Morland	Nay , since you make such a point of it , I can refuse you nothing . But do not insist upon my being very agreeable , for my heart , you know , will be some forty miles off . And as for dancing , do not mention it , I beg ; _ that _ is quite out of the question . Charles Hodges will plague me to death , I dare say ; but I shall cut him very short . Ten to one but he guesses the reason , and that is exactly what I want to avoid , so I shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself . ”
Catherine Morland	How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people ’s actions . ”
Catherine Morland	Why ? What do you mean ? ”
Catherine Morland	With you , it is not , How is such a one likely to be influenced , What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person ’s feelings , age , situation , and probable habits of life considered — but , How should _ I _ be influenced , What would be _ my _ inducement in acting so and so ? ”
Catherine Morland	I do not understand you . ”
Catherine Morland	Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . ”
Catherine Morland	Me ? Yes ; I can not speak well enough to be unintelligible . ”
Catherine Morland	Bravo ! an excellent satire on modern language . ”
Catherine Morland	But pray tell me what you mean . ”
Catherine Morland	Shall I indeed ? Do you really desire it ? But you are not aware of the consequences ; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment , and certainly bring on a disagreement between us . ”
Catherine Morland	No , no ; it shall not do either ; I am not afraid . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
Catherine Morland	I can not think how it could happen ! isabella was so determined not to dance . ”
Catherine Morland	And did Isabella never change her mind before ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! but , because — And your brother ! after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ”
Catherine Morland	I can not take surprise to myself on that head . You bid me be surprised on your friend ’s account , and therefore I am ; but as for my brother , his conduct in the business , I must own , has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to . The fairness of your friend was an open attraction ; her firmness , you know , could only be understood by yourself . ”
Catherine Morland	You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . ”
Catherine Morland	It is as much as should be said of anyone . To be always firm must be to be often obstinate . When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! my dear ! it would have looked so particular ; and you know how I abhor doing that . I refused him as long as I possibly could , but he would take no denial . You have no idea how he pressed me . I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner — but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me . Oh ! such nonsense ! i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so — and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up . Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening . I am so glad it is over ! my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense : and then , being such a smart young fellow , I saw every eye was upon us . ”
Catherine Morland	He is very handsome indeed . ”
Catherine Morland	Handsome ! yes , I suppose he may . I dare say people would admire him in general ; but he is not at all in my style of beauty . I hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man . However , he is very well . Amazingly conceited , I am sure . I took him down several times , you know , in my way . ”
Catherine Morland	It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life . For myself , it is nothing ; I never think of myself . ”
Catherine Morland	I know you never do , my dear ; and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you . There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child — but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things . Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome , you know . I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
Catherine Morland	Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure . But everybody has their failing , you know , and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money . ”
Catherine Morland	I am very sure , ”
Catherine Morland	that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford . ”
Catherine Morland	As to that , my sweet Catherine , there can not be a doubt , and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me . It is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits ; I hate money ; and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year , I should not have a wish unsatisfied . Ah ! my Catherine , you have found me out . There ’s the sting . The long , long , endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living . ”
Catherine Morland	This is strange indeed ! i did not expect such a sight as this ! an immense heavy chest ! what can it hold ? Why should it be placed here ? Pushed back too , as if meant to be out of sight ! i will look into it — cost me what it may , I will look into it — and directly too — by daylight . If I stay till evening my candle may go out . ”
Catherine Morland	That is a curious old chest , is not it ? ”
Catherine Morland	It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here . How it came to be first put in this room I know not , but I have not had it moved , because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets . The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open . In that corner , however , it is at least out of the way . ”
Catherine Morland	No , indeed , ”
Catherine Morland	Mr. Allen ’s dining - parlour was not more than half as large , ”
Catherine Morland	How much better is this , ”
Catherine Morland	She should take her time ; she should not hurry herself ; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house . But she would not make up her fire ; _ that _ would seem cowardly , as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed . ”
Catherine Morland	To poultice chestnut mare”—a farrier ’s bill ! such was the collection of papers ( left perhaps , as she could then suppose , by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them ) which had filled her with expectation and alarm , and robbed her of half her night ’s rest ! she felt humbled to the dust . Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom ? A corner of it , catching her eye as she lay , seemed to rise up in judgment against her . Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies . To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that , so modern , so habitable!—Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet , the key of which was open to all ! How could she have so imposed on herself ? Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly ! and it was in a great measure his own doing , for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures , she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it . This was the only comfort that occurred . Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly , those detestable papers then scattered over the bed , she rose directly , and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before , returned them to the same spot within the cabinet , with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again , to disgrace her even with herself . Why the locks should have been so difficult to open , however , was still something remarkable , for she could now manage them with perfect ease . In this there was surely something mysterious , and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute , till the possibility of the door ’s having been at first unlocked , and of being herself its fastener , darted into her head , and cost her another blush . She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections , and found her way with all speed to the breakfast - parlour , as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before . Henry was alone in it ; and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest , with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited , was rather distressing . For the world would she not have her weakness suspected , and yet , unequal to an absolute falsehood , was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little . “ But we have a charming morning after it , ”
Catherine Morland	and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over . What beautiful hyacinths ! i have just learnt to love a hyacinth . ”
Catherine Morland	And how might you learn ? By accident or argument ? ”
Catherine Morland	Your sister taught me ; I can not tell how . Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . ”
Catherine Morland	But now you love a hyacinth . So much the better . You have gained a new source of enjoyment , and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible . Besides , a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex , as a means of getting you out of doors , and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take . And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic , who can tell , the sentiment once raised , but you may in time come to love a rose ? ”
Catherine Morland	But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors . The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me , and in fine weather I am out more than half my time . Mamma says I am never within . ”
Catherine Morland	At any rate , however , I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth . The mere habit of learning to love is the thing ; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing . Has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction ? ”
Catherine Morland	Woodston will make but a sombre appearance to - day . ”
Catherine Morland	Is it a pretty place ? ”
Catherine Morland	What say you , Eleanor ? Speak your opinion , for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men . I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations . The house stands among fine meadows facing the south - east , with an excellent kitchen - garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son . It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one . Did Henry ’s income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill - provided for . Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business . But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment . The money is nothing , it is not an object , but employment is the thing . Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession . ”
Catherine Morland	And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . ”
Catherine Morland	But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object . The weather was at present favourable , and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so . Which would she prefer ? He was equally at her service . Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend ’s wishes ? But he thought he could discern . Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland ’s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather . But when did she judge amiss ? The abbey would be always safe and dry . He yielded implicitly , and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment . ”
Catherine Morland	I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father ’s account ; he always walks out at this time of day . ”
Catherine Morland	No , not at all . Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . ”
Catherine Morland	Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then . ”
Catherine Morland	This is so favourite a walk of mine , ”
Catherine Morland	that I always think it the best and nearest way . But perhaps it may be damp . ”
Catherine Morland	I am particularly fond of this spot , ”
Catherine Morland	I used to walk here so often with her ! ”
Catherine Morland	though I never loved it then , as I have loved it since . At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice . But her memory endears it now . ”
Catherine Morland	And ought it not , ”
Catherine Morland	to endear it to her husband ? Yet the General would not enter it . ”
Catherine Morland	Her death must have been a great affliction ! ”
Catherine Morland	A great and increasing one , ”
Catherine Morland	I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . ”
Catherine Morland	I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ”
Catherine Morland	To be sure you must miss him very much . ”
Catherine Morland	A mother would have been always present . A mother would have been a constant friend ; her influence would have been beyond all other . ”
Catherine Morland	Was she a very charming woman ? Was she handsome ? Was there any picture of her in the abbey ? And why had she been so partial to that grove ? Was it from dejection of spirits?”—were questions now eagerly poured forth ; the first three received a ready affirmative , the two others were passed by ; and Catherine ’s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question , whether answered or not . Of her unhappiness in marriage , she felt persuaded . The General certainly had been an unkind husband . He did not love her walk : could he therefore have loved her ? And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . “ Her picture , I suppose , ”
Catherine Morland	hangs in your father ’s room ? ”
Catherine Morland	No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place . Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ”
Catherine Morland	lengthened absence , these solitary rambles , did not speak a mind at ease , or a conscience void of reproach . ” At
Catherine Morland	was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ” were
Catherine Morland	, entirely . ” “
Catherine Morland	how long ago may it be that your mother died ? ” “
Catherine Morland	has been dead these nine years . ” And
Catherine Morland	were with her , I suppose , to the last ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, ” said
Catherine Morland	was unfortunately from home . Her illness was sudden and short ; and , before I arrived it was all over . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	have many pamphlets to finish , ” said
Catherine Morland	But he will tell only half of it . ”
Catherine Morland	A quarter would be enough . ”
Catherine Morland	And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting , and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , well , we will take our chance some one of those days . There is no need to fix . You are not to put yourself at all out of your way . Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough . I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor ’s table . Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come on Monday ; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me . I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning ; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club . I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it . They are a set of very worthy men . They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year ; and I dine with them whenever I can . Tuesday , therefore , we may say is out of the question . But on Wednesday , I think , Henry , you may expect us ; and we shall be with you early , that we may have time to look about us . Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston , I suppose ; we shall be in the carriage by ten ; so , about a quarter before one on Wednesday , you may look for us . ”
Catherine Morland	I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour . Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday , which bad weather , or twenty other causes , may prevent , I must go away directly , two days before I intended it . ”
Catherine Morland	Go away ! ”
Catherine Morland	And why ? ”
Catherine Morland	Why ! how can you ask the question ? Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits , because I must go and prepare a dinner for you , to be sure . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! not seriously ! ”
Catherine Morland	Aye , and sadly too — for I had much rather stay . ”
Catherine Morland	But how can you think of such a thing , after what the General said ? When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble , because _ anything _ would do . ”
Catherine Morland	I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister ’s account and mine . You must know it to be so ; and the General made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . ”
Catherine Morland	I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own . Good - bye . As to - morrow is Sunday , Eleanor , I shall not return . ”
Catherine Morland	We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger — we are considering it as a mere parsonage , small and confined , we allow , but decent , perhaps , and habitable ; and altogether not inferior to the generality ; or , in other words , I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good . It may admit of improvement , however . Far be it from me to say otherwise ; and anything in reason — a bow thrown out , perhaps — though , between ourselves , if there is one thing more than another my aversion , it is a patched - on bow . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! why do not you fit up this room , Mr. Tilney ? What a pity not to have it fitted up ! it is the prettiest room I ever saw ; it is the prettiest room in the world ! ”
Catherine Morland	Well , if it was my house , I should never sit anywhere else . Oh ! what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees — apple trees , too ! it is the prettiest cottage ! ”
Catherine Morland	You like it — you approve it as an object — it is enough . Henry , remember that Robinson is spoken to about it . The cottage remains . ”
Catherine Morland	she must confess herself very partial to the profession ” ;
Catherine Morland	Does he ? Then why does he stay here ? ”
Catherine Morland	Why do not you persuade him to go away ? The longer he stays , the worse it will be for him at last . Pray advise him for his own sake , and for everybody ’s sake , to leave Bath directly . Absence will in time make him comfortable again ; but he can have no hope here , and it is only staying to be miserable . ”
Catherine Morland	I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . ”
Catherine Morland	Then you will persuade him to go away ? ”
Catherine Morland	Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him . I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged . He knows what he is about , and must be his own master . ”
Catherine Morland	No , he does not know what he is about , ”
Catherine Morland	he does not know the pain he is giving my brother . Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . ”
Catherine Morland	And are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , very sure . ”
Catherine Morland	Is it my brother ’s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe ’s admission of them , that gives the pain ? ”
Catherine Morland	Is not it the same thing ? ”
Catherine Morland	I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference . No man is offended by another man ’s admiration of the woman he loves ; it is the woman only who can make it a torment . ”
Catherine Morland	Isabella is wrong . But I am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother . She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever . You know she must be attached to him . ”
Catherine Morland	I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh no , not flirts . A woman in love with one man can not flirt with another . ”
Catherine Morland	It is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly . The gentlemen must each give up a little . ”
Catherine Morland	Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ”
Catherine Morland	I can have no opinion on that subject . ”
Catherine Morland	But what can your brother mean ? If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? ”
Catherine Morland	You are a very close questioner . ”
Catherine Morland	Am I ? I only ask what I want to be told . ”
Catherine Morland	But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ”
Catherine Morland	My brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ”
Catherine Morland	Well ? ”
Catherine Morland	Well ! nay , if it is to be guesswork , let us all guess for ourselves . To be guided by second - hand conjecture is pitiful . The premises are before you . My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week ’s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , ”
Catherine Morland	_ you _ may be able to guess at your brother ’s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not . But is not your father uncomfortable about it ? Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ? Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go . ”
Catherine Morland	Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us . His leave of absence will soon expire , and he must return to his regiment . And what will then be their acquaintance ? The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ”
Catherine Morland	This lengthened absence , these solitary rambles , did not speak a mind at ease , or a conscience void of reproach . ”
Catherine Morland	I was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ”
Catherine Morland	It remains as it was , I suppose ? ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , entirely . ”
Catherine Morland	And how long ago may it be that your mother died ? ”
Catherine Morland	She has been dead these nine years . ”
Catherine Morland	You were with her , I suppose , to the last ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , ”
Catherine Morland	I was unfortunately from home . Her illness was sudden and short ; and , before I arrived it was all over . ”
Catherine Morland	My father , ”
Catherine Morland	often walks about the room in this way ; it is nothing unusual . ”
Catherine Morland	So much the worse ! ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! as to _ that _ , Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all . As long as she was happy , they would always be satisfied . ”
Catherine Morland	Then why , might she ask , in such a hurry herself to leave them ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! because she had been there so long . ”
Catherine Morland	Nay , if you can use such a word , I can urge you no farther . If you think it long — ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! no , I do not indeed . For my own pleasure , I could stay with you as long again . ”
Catherine Morland	I am quite well . This kindness distracts me — I can not bear it — I come to you on such an errand ! ”
Catherine Morland	Errand ! to me ! ”
Catherine Morland	How shall I tell you ! oh ! how shall I tell you ! ”
Catherine Morland	You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform . I am indeed a most unwilling messenger . After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words . My dear Catherine , we are to part . My father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on Monday . We are going to Lord Longtown ’s , near Hereford , for a fortnight . Explanation and apology are equally impossible . I can not attempt either . ”
Catherine Morland	My dear Eleanor , ”
Catherine Morland	do not be so distressed . A second engagement must give way to a first . I am very , very sorry we are to part — so soon , and so suddenly too ; but I am not offended , indeed I am not . I can finish my visit here , you know , at any time ; or I hope you will come to me . Can you , when you return from this lord ’s , come to Fullerton ? ”
Catherine Morland	It will not be in my power , Catherine . ”
Catherine Morland	Come when you can , then . ”
Catherine Morland	Monday — so soon as Monday ; and you _ all _ go . Well , I am certain of — I shall be able to take leave , however . I need not go till just before you do , you know . Do not be distressed , Eleanor , I can go on Monday very well . My father and mother ’s having no notice of it is of very little consequence . The General will send a servant with me , I dare say , half the way — and then I shall soon be at Salisbury , and then I am only nine miles from home . ”
Catherine Morland	Ah , Catherine ! were it settled so , it would be somewhat less intolerable , though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought . But — how can I tell you?—to - morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o’clock , and no servant will be offered you . ”
Catherine Morland	I could hardly believe my senses , when I heard it ; and no displeasure , no resentment that you can feel at this moment , however justly great , can be more than I myself — but I must not talk of what I felt . Oh ! that I could suggest anything in extenuation ! good God ! what will your father and mother say ! after courting you from the protection of real friends to this — almost double distance from your home , to have you driven out of the house , without the considerations even of decent civility ! dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . ”
Catherine Morland	Have I offended the General ? ”
Catherine Morland	Alas ! for my feelings as a daughter , all that I know , all that I answer for , is that you can have given him no just cause of offence . He certainly is greatly , very greatly discomposed ; I have seldom seen him more so . His temper is not happy , and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree ; some disappointment , some vexation , which just at this moment seems important , but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in , for how is it possible ? ”
Catherine Morland	I am sure , ”
Catherine Morland	I am very sorry if I have offended him . It was the last thing I would willingly have done . But do not be unhappy , Eleanor . An engagement , you know , must be kept . I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner , that I might have written home . But it is of very little consequence . ”
Catherine Morland	I hope , I earnestly hope , that to your real safety it will be of none ; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence : to comfort , appearance , propriety , to your family , to the world . Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , the journey is nothing . Do not think about that . And if we are to part , a few hours sooner or later , you know , makes no difference . I can be ready by seven . Let me be called in time . ”
Catherine Morland	You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , ”
Catherine Morland	you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible . Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour ’s comfort . For _ one _ letter , at all risks , all hazards , I must entreat . Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more . Direct to me at Lord Longtown ’s , and , I must ask it , under cover to Alice . ”
Catherine Morland	No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write . There can be no doubt of my getting home safe . ”
Catherine Morland	I can not wonder at your feelings . I will not importune you . I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , Eleanor , I _ will _ write to you indeed . ”
Catherine Morland	her kind remembrance for her absent friend . ”
Catherine Morland	was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , ” grew
Catherine Morland	dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , ” said
Catherine Morland	upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . ” “
Catherine Morland	can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , ” said
Catherine Morland	why not do it civilly ? ” “
Catherine Morland	am sorry for the young people , ” returned
Catherine Morland	must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General Tilney . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	has been a strange acquaintance , ” observed
Catherine Morland	made and soon ended . I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella . Ah ! poor James ! well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . ” “
Catherine Morland	so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy . It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years ; and then what a pleasure it will be ! ” Mrs.
Catherine Morland	otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ; for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with , and who was so entirely without fortune ; and now , after such behaviour , we can not think at all well of her . Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice . ” This
Catherine Morland	took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , ” said
Catherine Morland	travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house . Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again ! and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ” Mr.
Catherine Morland	, but _ that _ did not last long , ” said
Catherine Morland	true : we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe , and then we wanted for nothing . My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ? I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since . Do you remember that evening ? ” “
Catherine Morland	I ! oh ! perfectly . ” “
Catherine Morland	was very agreeable , was not it ? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable . I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure . I remember I had my favourite gown on . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	I never look at it , ”
Catherine Morland	without thinking of the south of France . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! no , I only mean what I have read about . It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her father travelled through , in The Mysteries of Udolpho . But you never read novels , I dare say ? ”
Catherine Morland	Why not ? ”
Catherine Morland	Because they are not clever enough for you — gentlemen read better books . ”
Catherine Morland	The person , be it gentleman or lady , who has not pleasure in a good novel , must be intolerably stupid . I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe ’s works , and most of them with great pleasure . The Mysteries of Udolpho , when I had once begun it , I could not lay down again ; I remember finishing it in two days — my hair standing on end the whole time . ”
Catherine Morland	I am very glad to hear it indeed , and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself . But I really thought before , young men despised novels amazingly . ”
Catherine Morland	It is _ amazingly ; _ it may well suggest _ amazement _ if they do — for they read nearly as many as women . I myself have read hundreds and hundreds . Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and Louisas . If we proceed to particulars , and engage in the never - ceasing inquiry of ‘ Have you read this ? ’ and ‘ Have you read that ? ’ I shall soon leave you as far behind me as — what shall I say?—I want an appropriate simile.—as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into Italy . Consider how many years I have had the start of you . I had entered on my studies at Oxford , while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home ! ”
Catherine Morland	Not very good , I am afraid . But now really , do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world ? ”
Catherine Morland	The nicest — by which I suppose you mean the neatest . That must depend upon the binding . ”
Catherine Morland	I am sure , ”
Catherine Morland	I did not mean to say anything wrong ; but it _ is _ a nice book , and why should not I call it so ? ”
Catherine Morland	That is , I can read poetry and plays , and things of that sort , and do not dislike travels . But history , real solemn history , I can not be interested in . Can you ? ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , I am fond of history . ”
Catherine Morland	I wish I were too . I read it a little as a duty , but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me . The quarrels of popes and kings , with wars or pestilences , in every page ; the men all so good for nothing , and hardly any women at all — it is very tiresome : and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull , for a great deal of it must be invention . The speeches that are put into the heroes ’ mouths , their thoughts and designs — the chief of all this must be invention , and invention is what delights me in other books . ”
Catherine Morland	You are fond of history ! and so are Mr. Allen and my father ; and I have two brothers who do not dislike it . So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable ! at this rate , I shall not pity the writers of history any longer . If people like to read their books , it is all very well , but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes , which , as I used to think , nobody would willingly ever look into , to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate ; and though I know it is all very right and necessary , I have often wondered at the person ’s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . ”
Catherine Morland	Indeed ! and of what nature ? ”
Catherine Morland	That I do not know , nor who is the author . I have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet . ”
Catherine Morland	Good heaven ! where could you hear of such a thing ? ”
Catherine Morland	A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from London yesterday . It is to be uncommonly dreadful . I shall expect murder and everything of the kind . ”
Catherine Morland	You speak with astonishing composure ! but I hope your friend ’s accounts have been exaggerated ; and if such a design is known beforehand , proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect . ”
Catherine Morland	Miss Morland , do not mind what he says ; but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot . ”
Catherine Morland	Riot ! what riot ? ”
Catherine Morland	My dear Eleanor , the riot is only in your own brain . The confusion there is scandalous . Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out , in three duodecimo volumes , two hundred and seventy - six pages in each , with a frontispiece to the first , of two tombstones and a lantern — do you understand ? And you , Miss Morland — my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions . You talked of expected horrors in London — and instead of instantly conceiving , as any rational creature would have done , that such words could relate only to a circulating library , she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George ’s Fields , the Bank attacked , the Tower threatened , the streets of London flowing with blood , a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons ( the hopes of the nation ) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents , and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney , in the moment of charging at the head of his troop , knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window . Forgive her stupidity . The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman ; but she is by no means a simpleton in general . ”
Catherine Morland	No doubt ; but that is no explanation of the present . ”
Catherine Morland	What am I to do ? ”
Catherine Morland	You know what you ought to do . Clear your character handsomely before her . Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women . ”
Catherine Morland	Miss Morland , I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world — especially of those — whoever they may be — with whom I happen to be in company . ”
Catherine Morland	That is not enough . Be more serious . ”
Catherine Morland	Miss Morland , no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do . In my opinion , nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half . ”
Catherine Morland	We shall get nothing more serious from him now , Miss Morland . He is not in a sober mood . But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood , if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all , or an unkind one of me . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! yes , ”
Catherine Morland	I wish you could have gone too . It is a pity you could not all go . ”
Catherine Morland	Thank you ; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me . Indeed , I would not have gone on any account . I was saying so to Emily and Sophia when you overtook us . ”
Catherine Morland	heaven ! my dear Isabella , what do you mean ? Can you — can you really be in love with James ? ” This
Catherine Morland	will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland ’s family than to my own . ” This
Catherine Morland	are so like your dear brother , ” continued
Catherine Morland	I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you . But so it always is with me ; the first moment settles everything . The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas — the very first moment I beheld him — my heart was irrecoverably gone . I remember I wore my yellow gown , with my hair done up in braids ; and when I came into the drawing - room , and John introduced him , I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before . ” Here
Catherine Morland	is impossible , ” said
Catherine Morland	parents to be more kind , or more desirous of their children ’s happiness ; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately . ” “
Catherine Morland	says exactly the same , ” replied
Catherine Morland	yet I dare not expect it ; my fortune will be so small ; they never can consent to it . Your brother , who might marry anybody ! ” Here
Catherine Morland	, Isabella , you are too humble . The difference of fortune can be nothing to signify . ” “
Catherine Morland	, Morland , I must drive you away . Consider how far you have to ride . I can not bear to see you linger so . For heaven ’s sake , waste no more time . There , go , go — I insist on it . ” The
Catherine Morland	know what ” ;
Catherine Morland	, Miss Morland , ” said
Catherine Morland	am come to bid you good - bye . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	famous good thing this marrying scheme , upon my soul ! a clever fancy of Morland ’s and Belle ’s . What do you think of it , Miss Morland ? _ I _ say it is no bad notion . ” “
Catherine Morland	am sure I think it a very good one . ” “
Catherine Morland	you ? That ’s honest , by heavens ! i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however . Did you ever hear the old song , ‘ Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? ’ I say , you will come to Belle ’s wedding , I hope . ” “
Catherine Morland	; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . ” “
Catherine Morland	then you know”—twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh—“I say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . ” “
Catherine Morland	we ? But I never sing . Well , I wish you a good journey . I dine with Miss Tilney to - day , and must now be going home . ” “
Catherine Morland	, but there is no such confounded hurry . Who knows when we may be together again ? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight , and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me . ” “
Catherine Morland	is kind of you , however — kind and good - natured . I shall not forget it in a hurry . But you have more good nature and all that , than anybody living , I believe . A monstrous deal of good nature , and it is not only good nature , but you have so much , so much of everything ; and then you have such — upon my soul , I do not know anybody like you . ” “
Catherine Morland	! dear , there are a great many people like me , I dare say , only a great deal better . Good morning to you . ” “
Catherine Morland	I say , Miss Morland , I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long , if not disagreeable . ” “
Catherine Morland	do . My father and mother will be very glad to see you . ” “
Catherine Morland	I hope — I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . ” “
Catherine Morland	! dear , not at all . There are very few people I am sorry to see . Company is always cheerful . ” “
Catherine Morland	we may ; but it is more than I ever thought of . And as to _ most matters _ , to say the truth , there are not many that I know my own mind about . ” “
Catherine Morland	Jove , no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me . My notion of things is simple enough . Let me only have the girl I like , say I , with a comfortable house over my head , and what care I for all the rest ? Fortune is nothing . I am sure of a good income of my own ; and if she had not a penny , why , so much the better . ” “
Catherine Morland	true . I think like you there . If there is a good fortune on one side , there can be no occasion for any on the other . No matter which has it , so that there is enough . I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another . And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence . Good day . We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton , whenever it is convenient . ” And
Catherine Morland	Yes , ”
Catherine Morland	and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me , and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note , instead of waiting for me , you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk , and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it . ”
Catherine Morland	Thank you , Eleanor — a most honourable testimony . You see , Miss Morland , the injustice of your suspicions . Here was I , in my eagerness to get on , refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister , breaking the promise I had made of reading it aloud , and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part , by running away with the volume , which , you are to observe , was her own , particularly her own . I am proud when I reflect on it , and I think it must establish me in your good opinion . ”
Catherine Morland	Henry , ”
Catherine Morland	you are very impertinent . Miss Morland , he is treating you exactly as he does his sister . He is forever finding fault with me , for some incorrectness of language , and now he is taking the same liberty with you . The word ‘ nicest , ’ as you used it , did not suit him ; and you had better change it as soon as you can , or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way . ”
Catherine Morland	Historians , you think , ”
Catherine Morland	are not happy in their flights of fancy . They display imagination without raising interest . I am fond of history — and am very well contented to take the false with the true . In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records , which may be as much depended on , I conclude , as anything that does not actually pass under one ’s own observation ; and as for the little embellishments you speak of , they are embellishments , and I like them as such . If a speech be well drawn up , I read it with pleasure , by whomsoever it may be made — and probably with much greater , if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson , than if the genuine words of Caractacus , Agricola , or Alfred the Great . ”
Catherine Morland	And now , Henry , ”
Catherine Morland	that you have made us understand each other , you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself — unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister , and a great brute in your opinion of women in general . Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways . ”
Catherine Morland	I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them . ”
Catherine Morland	They set off at eight this morning , ”
Catherine Morland	and I am sure I do not envy them their drive . I think you and I are very well off to be out of the scrape . It must be the dullest thing in the world , for there is not a soul at Clifton at this time of year . Belle went with your brother , and John drove Maria . ”
Catherine Morland	Maria is gone . She was quite wild to go . She thought it would be something very fine . I can not say I admire her taste ; and for my part , I was determined from the first not to go , if they pressed me ever so much . ”
Catherine Morland	yourself . I am amazingly agitated , as you perceive . Let us sit down and talk in comfort . Well , and so you guessed it the moment you had my note ? Sly creature ! oh ! my dear Catherine , you alone , who know my heart , can judge of my present happiness . Your brother is the most charming of men . I only wish I were more worthy of him . But what will your excellent father and mother say ? Oh ! heavens ! when I think of them I am so agitated ! ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	remember too , Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening , and wore her puce - coloured sarsenet ; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her ; I could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it . Oh ! catherine , the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother ’s account ! i would not have you suffer half what I have done ! i am grown wretchedly thin , I know ; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety ; you have seen enough of it . I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually — so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church ! but my secret I was always sure would be safe with _ you _ . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	am sure they will consent , ” was
Catherine Morland	am sure they will be delighted with you . ” “
Catherine Morland	is just my way of thinking . Give me but a little cheerful company , let me only have the company of the people I love , let me only be where I like and with whom I like , and the devil take the rest , say I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same . But I have a notion , Miss Morland , you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters . ” “
Catherine Morland	to be a fool if he liked it ! ”
Catherine Morland	do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow . It would be hideous to be always together ; we should be the jest of the place . And so you are going to Northanger ! i am amazingly glad of it . It is one of the finest old places in England , I understand . I shall depend upon a most particular description of it . ”
Catherine Morland	You shall certainly have the best in my power to give . But who are you looking for ? Are your sisters coming ? ”
Catherine Morland	I am not looking for anybody . One ’s eyes must be somewhere , and you know what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine , when my thoughts are an hundred miles off . I am amazingly absent ; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world . Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp . ”
Catherine Morland	But I thought , Isabella , you had something in particular to tell me ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh yes , and so I have . But here is a proof of what I was saying . My poor head , I had quite forgot it . Well , the thing is this : I have just had a letter from John ; you can guess the contents . ”
Catherine Morland	No , indeed , I can not . ”
Catherine Morland	My sweet love , do not be so abominably affected . What can he write about , but yourself ? You know he is over head and ears in love with you . ”
Catherine Morland	With _ me _ , dear Isabella ! ”
Catherine Morland	Nay , my sweetest Catherine , this is being quite absurd ! modesty , and all that , is very well in its way , but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming . I have no idea of being so overstrained ! it is fishing for compliments . His attentions were such as a child must have noticed . And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement . He says so in this letter , says that he as good as made you an offer , and that you received his advances in the kindest way ; and now he wants me to urge his suit , and say all manner of pretty things to you . So it is in vain to affect ignorance . ”
Catherine Morland	As to any attentions on his side , I do declare , upon my honour , I never was sensible of them for a moment — except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming . And as to making me an offer , or anything like it , there must be some unaccountable mistake . I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind , you know ! and , as I ever wish to be believed , I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us . The last half hour before he went away ! it must be all and completely a mistake — for I did not see him once that whole morning . ”
Catherine Morland	But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar ’s Buildings — it was the day your father ’s consent came — and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . ”
Catherine Morland	Are you ? Well , if you say it , it was so , I dare say — but for the life of me , I can not recollect it . I _ do _ remember now being with you , and seeing him as well as the rest — but that we were ever alone for five minutes — However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him . I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me — but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side ; I never had the smallest idea of it . Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I ought to say — but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way . I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours , Isabella , I am sure ; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another—_he _ is not the person . ”
Catherine Morland	My dear friend , you must not be angry with me . I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me . And , you know , we shall still be sisters . ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , yes ”
Catherine Morland	there are more ways than one of our being sisters . But where am I wandering to ? Well , my dear Catherine , the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John — is not it so ? ”
Catherine Morland	I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . ”
Catherine Morland	Since that is the case , I am sure I shall not tease you any further . John desired me to speak to you on the subject , and therefore I have . But I confess , as soon as I read his letter , I thought it a very foolish , imprudent business , and not likely to promote the good of either ; for what were you to live upon , supposing you came together ? You have both of you something , to be sure , but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays ; and after all that romancers may say , there is no doing without money . I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . ”
Catherine Morland	You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! as to that , ”
Catherine Morland	But my opinion of your brother never did alter ; it was always the same . You are describing what never happened . ”
Catherine Morland	What ! always to be watched , in person or by proxy ! ”
Catherine Morland	I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
Catherine Morland	do not you persuade him to go away ? The longer he stays , the worse it will be for him at last . Pray advise him for his own sake , and for everybody ’s sake , to leave Bath directly . Absence will in time make him comfortable again ; but he can have no hope here , and it is only staying to be miserable . ” Henry
Catherine Morland	is wrong . But I am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother . She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever . You know she must be attached to him . ” “
Catherine Morland	understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ” “
Catherine Morland	is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly . The gentlemen must each give up a little . ” After
Catherine Morland	you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ” “
Catherine Morland	can have no opinion on that subject . ” “
Catherine Morland	you _ may be able to guess at your brother ’s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not . But is not your father uncomfortable about it ? Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ? Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go . ” “
Catherine Morland	dear Miss Morland , ” said
Catherine Morland	this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? Are you not carried a little too far ? Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ? Is he safe only in solitude ? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ? He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it . I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can . You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend ; depend upon it , therefore , that real jealousy never can exist between them ; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration . Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ” Perceiving
Catherine Morland	I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , sir , and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again , for it is just the place for young people — and indeed for everybody else too . I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health . ”
Catherine Morland	And I hope , madam , that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place , from finding it of service to him . ”
Catherine Morland	Thank you , sir . I have no doubt that he will . A neighbour of ours , Dr. Skinner , was here for his health last winter , and came away quite stout . ”
Catherine Morland	At last I have got you . My dearest creature , I have been looking for you this hour . What could induce you to come into this set , when you knew I was in the other ? I have been quite wretched without you . ”
Catherine Morland	My dear Isabella , how was it possible for me to get at you ? I could not even see where you were . ”
Catherine Morland	So I told your brother all the time — but he would not believe me . Do go and see for her , Mr. Morland , said I — but all in vain — he would not stir an inch . Was not it so , Mr. Morland ? But you men are all so immoderately lazy ! i have been scolding him to such a degree , my dear Catherine , you would be quite amazed . You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people . ”
Catherine Morland	It is Mr. Tilney ’s sister . ”
Catherine Morland	But what is all this whispering about ? What is going on ? ”
Catherine Morland	There now , I knew how it would be . You men have such restless curiosity ! talk of the curiosity of women , indeed ! ’ Tis nothing . But be satisfied , for you are not to know anything at all of the matter . ”
Catherine Morland	And is that likely to satisfy me , do you think ? ”
Catherine Morland	Well , I declare I never knew anything like you . What can it signify to you , what we are talking of . Perhaps we are talking about you ; therefore I would advise you not to listen , or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable . ”
Catherine Morland	I tell you , Mr. Morland , ”
Catherine Morland	I would not do such a thing for all the world . How can you be so teasing ; only conceive , my dear Catherine , what your brother wants me to do . He wants me to dance with him again , though I tell him that it is a most improper thing , and entirely against the rules . It would make us the talk of the place , if we were not to change partners . ”
Catherine Morland	No , not at all ; but if you think it wrong , you had much better change . ”
Catherine Morland	Very agreeable , madam . ”
Catherine Morland	No , where is he ? ”
Catherine Morland	Ah ! he has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , ”
Catherine Morland	Do not you ? Then let us walk about and quiz people . Come along with me , and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room ; my two younger sisters and their partners . I have been laughing at them this half hour . ”
Catherine Morland	do you mean ? ” said
Catherine Morland	are you all going to ? ” “
Catherine Morland	to ? Why , you have not forgot our engagement ! did not we agree together to take a drive this morning ? What a head you have ! we are going up Claverton Down . ” “
Catherine Morland	, ma’am , what do you say to it ? Can you spare me for an hour or two ? Shall I go ? ” “
Catherine Morland	just as you please , my dear , ” replied
Catherine Morland	let him go , ” and
Catherine Morland	no children at all ? ” “
Catherine Morland	— not any . ” “
Catherine Morland	famous thing for his next heirs . He is _ your _ godfather , is not he ? ” “
Catherine Morland	godfather ! no . ” “
Catherine Morland	you are always very much with them . ” “
Catherine Morland	, very much . ” “
Catherine Morland	, that is what I meant . He seems a good kind of old fellow enough , and has lived very well in his time , I dare say ; he is not gouty for nothing . Does he drink his bottle a day now ? ” “
Catherine Morland	bottle a day ! no . Why should you think of such a thing ? He is a very temperate man , and you could not fancy him in liquor last night ? ” “
Catherine Morland	help you ! you women are always thinking of men ’s being in liquor . Why , you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle ? I am sure of _ this_—that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day , there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now . It would be a famous good thing for us all . ” “
Catherine Morland	can not believe it . ” “
Catherine Morland	! lord , it would be the saving of thousands . There is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be . Our foggy climate wants help . ” “
Catherine Morland	yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford . ” “
Catherine Morland	! there is no drinking at Oxford now , I assure you . Nobody drinks there . You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost . Now , for instance , it was reckoned a remarkable thing , at the last party in my rooms , that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head . It was looked upon as something out of the common way . _ Mine _ is famous good stuff , to be sure . You would not often meet with anything like it in Oxford — and that may account for it . But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there . ” “
Catherine Morland	, it does give a notion , ” said
Catherine Morland	that is , that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did . However , I am sure James does not drink so much . ” This
Catherine Morland	down ! oh , lord ! did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life ? There is not a sound piece of iron about it . The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least — and as for the body ! upon my soul , you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch . It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld ! thank God ! we have got a better . I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds . ” “
Catherine Morland	heavens ! ” cried
Catherine Morland	pray let us turn back ; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on . Do let us turn back , Mr. Thorpe ; stop and speak to my brother , and tell him how very unsafe it is . ” “
Catherine Morland	! oh , lord ! what is there in that ? They will only get a roll if it does break down ; and there is plenty of dirt ; it will be excellent falling . Oh , curse it ! the carriage is safe enough , if a man knows how to drive it ; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out . Lord bless you ! i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again , without losing a nail . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	Mrs. Thorpe said ; she was vastly pleased at your all going . ” “
Catherine Morland	, I went to the pump - room as soon as you were gone , and there I met her , and we had a great deal of talk together . She says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning , it is so uncommonly scarce . ” “
Catherine Morland	what did she tell you of them ? ” “
Catherine Morland	! a vast deal indeed ; she hardly talked of anything else . ” “
Catherine Morland	she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, she did ; but I can not recollect now . But they are very good kind of people , and very rich . Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond , and she and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows ; and Miss Drummond had a very large fortune ; and , when she married , her father gave her twenty thousand pounds , and five hundred to buy wedding - clothes . Mrs. Hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse . ” “
Catherine Morland	, I fancy they are , but I am not quite certain . Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . ” “
Catherine Morland	perhaps , ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial . He has been disappointed of some friends ’ arrival whom he expected to meet here , and as he is now pretty well , is in a hurry to get home . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ”
Catherine Morland	I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , proceed by all means . I know how much your heart is in it . My daughter , Miss Morland , ”
Catherine Morland	has been forming a very bold wish . We leave Bath , as she has perhaps told you , on Saturday se’nnight . A letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home ; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here , some of my very old friends , there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath . And could we carry our selfish point with you , we should leave it without a single regret . Can you , in short , be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire ? I am almost ashamed to make the request , though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself . Modesty such as yours — but not for the world would I pain it by open praise . If you can be induced to honour us with a visit , you will make us happy beyond expression . ’ Tis true , we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place ; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour , for our mode of living , as you see , is plain and unpretending ; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable . ”
Catherine Morland	I will write home directly , ”
Catherine Morland	and if they do not object , as I dare say they will not — ”
Catherine Morland	the day was fine , and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible . ”
Catherine Morland	But how can that be ? ”
Catherine Morland	Are not you with her ? ”
Catherine Morland	Northanger is not more than half my home ; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston , which is nearly twenty miles from my father ’s , and some of my time is necessarily spent there . ”
Catherine Morland	How sorry you must be for that ! ”
Catherine Morland	I am always sorry to leave Eleanor . ”
Catherine Morland	Yes ; but besides your affection for her , you must be so fond of the abbey ! after being used to such a home as the abbey , an ordinary parsonage - house must be very disagreeable . ”
Catherine Morland	You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey . ”
Catherine Morland	To be sure , I have . Is not it a fine old place , just like what one reads about ? ”
Catherine Morland	And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as ‘ what one reads about ’ may produce ? Have you a stout heart ? Nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! yes — I do not think I should be easily frightened , because there would be so many people in the house — and besides , it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years , and then the family come back to it unawares , without giving any notice , as generally happens . ”
Catherine Morland	No , certainly . We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire — nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows , doors , or furniture . But you must be aware that when a young lady is ( by whatever means ) introduced into a dwelling of this kind , she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family . While they snugly repair to their own end of the house , she is formally conducted by Dorothy , the ancient housekeeper , up a different staircase , and along many gloomy passages , into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before . Can you stand such a ceremony as this ? Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber — too lofty and extensive for you , with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size — its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life , and the bed , of dark green stuff or purple velvet , presenting even a funereal appearance ? Will not your heart sink within you ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! but this will not happen to me , I am sure . ”
Catherine Morland	How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment ! and what will you discern ? Not tables , toilettes , wardrobes , or drawers , but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute , on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open , and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior , whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you , that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it . Dorothy , meanwhile , no less struck by your appearance , gazes on you in great agitation , and drops a few unintelligible hints . To raise your spirits , moreover , she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted , and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call . With this parting cordial she curtsies off — you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you — and when , with fainting spirits , you attempt to fasten your door , you discover , with increased alarm , that it has no lock . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! mr . Tilney , how frightful ! this is just like a book ! but it can not really happen to me . I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy . Well , what then ? ”
Catherine Morland	Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night . After surmounting your _ unconquerable _ horror of the bed , you will retire to rest , and get a few hours ’ unquiet slumber . But on the second , or at farthest the _ third _ night after your arrival , you will probably have a violent storm . Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains — and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it , you will probably think you discern ( for your lamp is not extinguished ) one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest . Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it , you will instantly arise , and throwing your dressing - gown around you , proceed to examine this mystery . After a very short search , you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection , and on opening it , a door will immediately appear — which door , being only secured by massy bars and a padlock , you will , after a few efforts , succeed in opening — and , with your lamp in your hand , will pass through it into a small vaulted room . ”
Catherine Morland	No , indeed ; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing . ”
Catherine Morland	What ! not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony , scarcely two miles off . Could you shrink from so simple an adventure ? No , no , you will proceed into this small vaulted room , and through this into several others , without perceiving anything very remarkable in either . In one perhaps there may be a dagger , in another a few drops of blood , and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture ; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way , and your lamp being nearly exhausted , you will return towards your own apartment . In repassing through the small vaulted room , however , your eyes will be attracted towards a large , old - fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold , which , though narrowly examining the furniture before , you had passed unnoticed . Impelled by an irresistible presentiment , you will eagerly advance to it , unlock its folding doors , and search into every drawer — but for some time without discovering anything of importance — perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds . At last , however , by touching a secret spring , an inner compartment will open — a roll of paper appears — you seize it — it contains many sheets of manuscript — you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber , but scarcely have you been able to decipher ‘ Oh thou , whomsoever thou mayst be , into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall’—when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket , and leaves you in total darkness . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , no , no ; do not say so . Well , go on . ”
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney , she was sure , would never put her into such a chamber as he had described ! she was not at all afraid . ”
Catherine Morland	I beg , Catherine , you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat , when you come from the Rooms at night ; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend ; I will give you this little book on purpose . ”
Catherine Morland	How uncomfortable it is , ”
Catherine Morland	not to have a single acquaintance here ! ”
Catherine Morland	What shall we do ? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here — we seem forcing ourselves into their party . ”
Catherine Morland	Aye , so we do . That is very disagreeable . I wish we had a large acquaintance here . ”
Catherine Morland	I wish we had _ any;_—it would be somebody to go to . ”
Catherine Morland	Very true , my dear ; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly . The Skinners were here last year — I wish they were here now . ”
Catherine Morland	Had not we better go away as it is ? Here are no tea - things for us , you see . ”
Catherine Morland	No more there are , indeed . How very provoking ! but I think we had better sit still , for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd ! how is my head , my dear ? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it , I am afraid . ”
Catherine Morland	No , indeed , it looks very nice . But , dear Mrs. Allen , are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people ? I think you _ must _ know somebody . ”
Catherine Morland	I do n’t , upon my word — I wish I did . I wish I had a large acquaintance here with all my heart , and then I should get you a partner . I should be so glad to have you dance . There goes a strange - looking woman ! what an odd gown she has got on ! how old - fashioned it is ! look at the back . ”
Catherine Morland	Very agreeable indeed , ”
Catherine Morland	I wish she had been able to dance , ”
Catherine Morland	I wish we could have got a partner for her . I have been saying how glad I should be if the Skinners were here this winter instead of last ; or if the Parrys had come , as they talked of once , she might have danced with George Parry . I am so sorry she has not had a partner ! ”
Catherine Morland	need not give yourself that trouble , sir . ” “
Catherine Morland	trouble , I assure you , madam . ” Then
Catherine Morland	a week , sir , ” replied
Catherine Morland	should you be surprised , sir ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, sir . ” “
Catherine Morland	you been to the theatre ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, sir , I was at the play on Tuesday . ” “
Catherine Morland	the concert ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, sir , on Wednesday . ” “
Catherine Morland	are you altogether pleased with Bath ? ” “
Catherine Morland	— I like it very well . ” “
Catherine Morland	see what you think of me , ” said
Catherine Morland	journal ! ” “
Catherine Morland	, I know exactly what you will say : Friday , went to the Lower Rooms ; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings — plain black shoes — appeared to much advantage ; but was strangely harassed by a queer , half - witted man , who would make me dance with him , and distressed me by his nonsense . ” “
Catherine Morland	I shall say no such thing . ” “
Catherine Morland	I tell you what you ought to say ? ” “
Catherine Morland	you please . ” “
Catherine Morland	danced with a very agreeable young man , introduced by Mr. King ; had a great deal of conversation with him — seems a most extraordinary genius — hope I may know more of him . _ That _ , madam , is what I _ wish _ you to say . ” “
Catherine Morland	, perhaps , I keep no journal . ” “
Catherine Morland	you are not sitting in this room , and I am not sitting by you . These are points in which a doubt is equally possible . Not keep a journal ! how are your absent cousins to understand the tenor of your life in Bath without one ? How are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be , unless noted down every evening in a journal ? How are your various dresses to be remembered , and the particular state of your complexion , and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities , without having constant recourse to a journal ? My dear madam , I am not so ignorant of young ladies ’ ways as you wish to believe me ; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated . Everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female . Nature may have done something , but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal . ” “
Catherine Morland	have sometimes thought , ” said
Catherine Morland	ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen ! that is — I should not think the superiority was always on our side . ” “
Catherine Morland	far as I have had opportunity of judging , it appears to me that the usual style of letter - writing among women is faultless , except in three particulars . ” “
Catherine Morland	what are they ? ” “
Catherine Morland	general deficiency of subject , a total inattention to stops , and a very frequent ignorance of grammar . ” “
Catherine Morland	my word ! i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment . You do not think too highly of us in that way . ” “
Catherine Morland	should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men , than that they sing better duets , or draw better landscapes . In every power , of which taste is the foundation , excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes . ” They
Catherine Morland	dear Catherine , ” said
Catherine Morland	take this pin out of my sleeve ; I am afraid it has torn a hole already ; I shall be quite sorry if it has , for this is a favourite gown , though it cost but nine shillings a yard . ” “
Catherine Morland	is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , ” said
Catherine Morland	you understand muslins , sir ? ” “
Catherine Morland	well ; I always buy my own cravats , and am allowed to be an excellent judge ; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown . I bought one for her the other day , and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it . I gave but five shillings a yard for it , and a true Indian muslin . ” Mrs.
Catherine Morland	pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland ’s gown ? ” “
Catherine Morland	is very pretty , madam , ” said
Catherine Morland	I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . ” “
Catherine Morland	. ” “
Catherine Morland	then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak . Muslin can never be said to be wasted . I have heard my sister say so forty times , when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted , or careless in cutting it to pieces . ” “
Catherine Morland	is a charming place , sir ; there are so many good shops here . We are sadly off in the country ; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury , but it is so far to go — eight miles is a long way ; Mr. Allen says it is nine , measured nine ; but I am sure it can not be more than eight ; and it is such a fag — I come back tired to death . Now , here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes . ” Mr.
Catherine Morland	was not thinking of anything . ” “
Catherine Morland	then , I will not . ” “
Catherine Morland	’ Tis only from James , however , ”
Catherine Morland	Dear Catherine , “ Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me . I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again . I shall not enter into particulars — they would only pain you more . You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God ! i am undeceived in time ! but it is a heavy blow ! after my father ’s consent had been so kindly given — but no more of this . She has made me miserable forever ! let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; _ your _ love I do build upon . I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced . Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much . I have written to him and my father . Her duplicity hurts me more than all ; till the very last , if I reasoned with her , she declared herself as much attached to me as ever , and laughed at my fears . I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it ; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved , I was that man . I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney . We parted at last by mutual consent — happy for me had we never met ! i can never expect to know such another woman ! Dearest Catherine , beware how you give your heart . “ Believe me , ”
Catherine Morland	No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? Mr. and Mrs. Morland — your brothers and sisters — I hope they are none of them ill ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , I thank you ”
Catherine Morland	they are all very well . My letter was from my brother at Oxford . ”
Catherine Morland	I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again ! ”
Catherine Morland	It contained something worse than anybody could suppose ! poor James is so unhappy ! you will soon know why . ”
Catherine Morland	I have one favour to beg , ”
Catherine Morland	that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . ”
Catherine Morland	How quick you are ! ”
Catherine Morland	you have guessed it , I declare ! And yet , when we talked about it in Bath , you little thought of its ending so . Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours ! could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ”
Catherine Morland	I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed . I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland ’s disappointment . His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable . I think you must be deceived so far . I am very sorry for Mr. Morland — sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy ; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ”
Catherine Morland	It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ”
Catherine Morland	Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , read it yourself , ”
Catherine Morland	I do not know what I was thinking of ”
Catherine Morland	James only means to give me good advice . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , if it is to be so , I can only say that I am sorry for it . Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected . I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . ”
Catherine Morland	Her mother is a very good sort of woman , ”
Catherine Morland	What was her father ? ”
Catherine Morland	A lawyer , I believe . They live at Putney . ”
Catherine Morland	Are they a wealthy family ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , not very . I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family . Your father is so very liberal ! He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children . ”
Catherine Morland	That is the most unpromising circumstance , the strongest presumption against him . When I think of his past declarations , I give him up . Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe ’s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured . It is all over with Frederick indeed ! he is a deceased man — defunct in understanding . Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . ”
Catherine Morland	But perhaps , ”
Catherine Morland	though she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours . Now she has really got the man she likes , she may be constant . ”
Catherine Morland	You think it is all for ambition , then ? And , upon my word , there are some things that seem very like it . I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more . I never was so deceived in anyone ’s character in my life before . ”
Catherine Morland	Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . ”
Catherine Morland	My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it . ”
Catherine Morland	Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours . You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy . Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent . You would not , for instance , now go to a ball for the world . You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve , on whose regard you can place dependence , or whose counsel , in any difficulty , you could rely on . You feel all this ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , ”
Catherine Morland	I do not — ought I ? To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought . ”
Catherine Morland	You feel , as you always do , what is most to the credit of human nature . Such feelings ought to be investigated , that they may know themselves . ”
Catherine Morland	How came you here ? How came you up that staircase ? ”
Catherine Morland	How came I up that staircase ! ”
Catherine Morland	Because it is my nearest way from the stable - yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? ”
Catherine Morland	I have been , ”
Catherine Morland	to see your mother ’s room . ”
Catherine Morland	I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me . You look pale . I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs . Perhaps you did not know — you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , I was not . You have had a very fine day for your ride . ”
Catherine Morland	Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh no ! she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday — and we were coming here to these rooms — but only , ”
Catherine Morland	your father was with us . ”
Catherine Morland	And that prevented you , ”
Catherine Morland	Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , I only wanted to see — Is not it very late ? I must go and dress . ”
Catherine Morland	Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you ? ”
Catherine Morland	No , and I am very much surprised . Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly . ”
Catherine Morland	Promised so faithfully ! a faithful promise ! that puzzles me . I have heard of a faithful performance . But a faithful promise — the fidelity of promising ! it is a power little worth knowing , however , since it can deceive and pain you . My mother ’s room is very commodious , is it not ? Large and cheerful - looking , and the dressing - closets so well disposed ! It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house , and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own . She sent you to look at it , I suppose ? ”
Catherine Morland	No . ”
Catherine Morland	It has been your own doing entirely ? ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , a great deal . That is — no , not much , but what she did say was very interesting . Her dying so suddenly ”
Catherine Morland	But your father , ”
Catherine Morland	was _ he _ afflicted ? ”
Catherine Morland	For a time , greatly so . You have erred in supposing him not attached to her . He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to — we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition — and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did . His value of her was sincere ; and , if not permanently , he was truly afflicted by her death . ”
Catherine Morland	I am very glad of it , ”
Catherine Morland	it would have been very shocking ! ”
Catherine Morland	If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to — Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained . What have you been judging from ? Remember the country and the age in which we live . Remember that we are English , that we are Christians . Consult your own understanding , your own sense of the probable , your own observation of what is passing around you . Does our education prepare us for such atrocities ? Do our laws connive at them ? Could they be perpetrated without being known , in a country like this , where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing , where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies , and where roads and newspapers lay everything open ? Dearest Miss Morland , what ideas have you been admitting ? ”
Catherine Morland	Tis only from James , however , ” as
Catherine Morland	bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? Mr. and Mrs. Morland — your brothers and sisters — I hope they are none of them ill ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, I thank you ” (
Catherine Morland	are all very well . My letter was from my brother at Oxford . ” Nothing
Catherine Morland	do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again ! ” “
Catherine Morland	contained something worse than anybody could suppose ! poor James is so unhappy ! you will soon know why . ” “
Catherine Morland	have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , ” replied
Catherine Morland	be a comfort to him under any distress . ” “
Catherine Morland	have one favour to beg , ” said
Catherine Morland	, if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . ” “
Catherine Morland	brother ! frederick ! ” “
Catherine Morland	; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ” Eleanor
Catherine Morland	hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed . I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland ’s disappointment . His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable . I think you must be deceived so far . I am very sorry for Mr. Morland — sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy ; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “
Catherine Morland	is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting
Catherine Morland	you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, read it yourself , ” cried
Catherine Morland	do not know what I was thinking of ” (
Catherine Morland	only means to give me good advice . ” He
Catherine Morland	, if it is to be so , I can only say that I am sorry for it . Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected . I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . ” Miss
Catherine Morland	was her father ? ” “
Catherine Morland	lawyer , I believe . They live at Putney . ” “
Catherine Morland	they a wealthy family ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, not very . I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family . Your father is so very liberal ! He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children . ” The
Catherine Morland	, ” said
Catherine Morland	it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ? She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so . And how strange an infatuation on Frederick ’s side ! a girl who , before his eyes , is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man ! is not it inconceivable , Henry ? Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly ! who found no woman good enough to be loved ! ” “
Catherine Morland	she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours . Now she has really got the man she likes , she may be constant . ” “
Catherine Morland	think it is all for ambition , then ? And , upon my word , there are some things that seem very like it . I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more . I never was so deceived in anyone ’s character in my life before . ” “
Catherine Morland	all the great variety that you have known and studied . ” “
Catherine Morland	own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it . ” “
Catherine Morland	brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours . You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy . Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent . You would not , for instance , now go to a ball for the world . You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve , on whose regard you can place dependence , or whose counsel , in any difficulty , you could rely on . You feel all this ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, ” said
Catherine Morland	do not — ought I ? To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought . ” “
Catherine Morland	feel , as you always do , what is most to the credit of human nature . Such feelings ought to be investigated , that they may know themselves . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	Oh ! as to _ that _ , Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all . As long as she was happy , they would always be satisfied . ”
Catherine Morland	Then why , might she ask , in such a hurry herself to leave them ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! because she had been there so long . ”
Catherine Morland	Nay , if you can use such a word , I can urge you no farther . If you think it long — ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! no , I do not indeed . For my own pleasure , I could stay with you as long again . ”
Catherine Morland	I am quite well . This kindness distracts me — I can not bear it — I come to you on such an errand ! ”
Catherine Morland	Errand ! to me ! ”
Catherine Morland	How shall I tell you ! oh ! how shall I tell you ! ”
Catherine Morland	You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform . I am indeed a most unwilling messenger . After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words . My dear Catherine , we are to part . My father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on Monday . We are going to Lord Longtown ’s , near Hereford , for a fortnight . Explanation and apology are equally impossible . I can not attempt either . ”
Catherine Morland	My dear Eleanor , ”
Catherine Morland	do not be so distressed . A second engagement must give way to a first . I am very , very sorry we are to part — so soon , and so suddenly too ; but I am not offended , indeed I am not . I can finish my visit here , you know , at any time ; or I hope you will come to me . Can you , when you return from this lord ’s , come to Fullerton ? ”
Catherine Morland	It will not be in my power , Catherine . ”
Catherine Morland	Come when you can , then . ”
Catherine Morland	Monday — so soon as Monday ; and you _ all _ go . Well , I am certain of — I shall be able to take leave , however . I need not go till just before you do , you know . Do not be distressed , Eleanor , I can go on Monday very well . My father and mother ’s having no notice of it is of very little consequence . The General will send a servant with me , I dare say , half the way — and then I shall soon be at Salisbury , and then I am only nine miles from home . ”
Catherine Morland	Ah , Catherine ! were it settled so , it would be somewhat less intolerable , though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought . But — how can I tell you?—to - morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o’clock , and no servant will be offered you . ”
Catherine Morland	I could hardly believe my senses , when I heard it ; and no displeasure , no resentment that you can feel at this moment , however justly great , can be more than I myself — but I must not talk of what I felt . Oh ! that I could suggest anything in extenuation ! good God ! what will your father and mother say ! after courting you from the protection of real friends to this — almost double distance from your home , to have you driven out of the house , without the considerations even of decent civility ! dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . ”
Catherine Morland	Have I offended the General ? ”
Catherine Morland	Alas ! for my feelings as a daughter , all that I know , all that I answer for , is that you can have given him no just cause of offence . He certainly is greatly , very greatly discomposed ; I have seldom seen him more so . His temper is not happy , and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree ; some disappointment , some vexation , which just at this moment seems important , but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in , for how is it possible ? ”
Catherine Morland	I am sure , ”
Catherine Morland	I am very sorry if I have offended him . It was the last thing I would willingly have done . But do not be unhappy , Eleanor . An engagement , you know , must be kept . I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner , that I might have written home . But it is of very little consequence . ”
Catherine Morland	I hope , I earnestly hope , that to your real safety it will be of none ; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence : to comfort , appearance , propriety , to your family , to the world . Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , the journey is nothing . Do not think about that . And if we are to part , a few hours sooner or later , you know , makes no difference . I can be ready by seven . Let me be called in time . ”
Catherine Morland	You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , ”
Catherine Morland	you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible . Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour ’s comfort . For _ one _ letter , at all risks , all hazards , I must entreat . Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more . Direct to me at Lord Longtown ’s , and , I must ask it , under cover to Alice . ”
Catherine Morland	No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write . There can be no doubt of my getting home safe . ”
Catherine Morland	I can not wonder at your feelings . I will not importune you . I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , Eleanor , I _ will _ write to you indeed . ”
Catherine Morland	her kind remembrance for her absent friend . ”
Catherine Morland	do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow . It would be hideous to be always together ; we should be the jest of the place . And so you are going to Northanger ! i am amazingly glad of it . It is one of the finest old places in England , I understand . I shall depend upon a most particular description of it . ”
Catherine Morland	You shall certainly have the best in my power to give . But who are you looking for ? Are your sisters coming ? ”
Catherine Morland	I am not looking for anybody . One ’s eyes must be somewhere , and you know what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine , when my thoughts are an hundred miles off . I am amazingly absent ; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world . Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp . ”
Catherine Morland	But I thought , Isabella , you had something in particular to tell me ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh yes , and so I have . But here is a proof of what I was saying . My poor head , I had quite forgot it . Well , the thing is this : I have just had a letter from John ; you can guess the contents . ”
Catherine Morland	No , indeed , I can not . ”
Catherine Morland	My sweet love , do not be so abominably affected . What can he write about , but yourself ? You know he is over head and ears in love with you . ”
Catherine Morland	With _ me _ , dear Isabella ! ”
Catherine Morland	Nay , my sweetest Catherine , this is being quite absurd ! modesty , and all that , is very well in its way , but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming . I have no idea of being so overstrained ! it is fishing for compliments . His attentions were such as a child must have noticed . And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement . He says so in this letter , says that he as good as made you an offer , and that you received his advances in the kindest way ; and now he wants me to urge his suit , and say all manner of pretty things to you . So it is in vain to affect ignorance . ”
Catherine Morland	As to any attentions on his side , I do declare , upon my honour , I never was sensible of them for a moment — except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming . And as to making me an offer , or anything like it , there must be some unaccountable mistake . I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind , you know ! and , as I ever wish to be believed , I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us . The last half hour before he went away ! it must be all and completely a mistake — for I did not see him once that whole morning . ”
Catherine Morland	But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar ’s Buildings — it was the day your father ’s consent came — and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . ”
Catherine Morland	Are you ? Well , if you say it , it was so , I dare say — but for the life of me , I can not recollect it . I _ do _ remember now being with you , and seeing him as well as the rest — but that we were ever alone for five minutes — However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him . I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me — but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side ; I never had the smallest idea of it . Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I ought to say — but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way . I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours , Isabella , I am sure ; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another—_he _ is not the person . ”
Catherine Morland	My dear friend , you must not be angry with me . I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me . And , you know , we shall still be sisters . ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , yes ”
Catherine Morland	there are more ways than one of our being sisters . But where am I wandering to ? Well , my dear Catherine , the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John — is not it so ? ”
Catherine Morland	I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . ”
Catherine Morland	Since that is the case , I am sure I shall not tease you any further . John desired me to speak to you on the subject , and therefore I have . But I confess , as soon as I read his letter , I thought it a very foolish , imprudent business , and not likely to promote the good of either ; for what were you to live upon , supposing you came together ? You have both of you something , to be sure , but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays ; and after all that romancers may say , there is no doing without money . I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . ”
Catherine Morland	You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! as to that , ”
Catherine Morland	But my opinion of your brother never did alter ; it was always the same . You are describing what never happened . ”
Catherine Morland	What ! always to be watched , in person or by proxy ! ”
Catherine Morland	I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
Catherine Morland	To poultice chestnut mare”—a farrier ’s bill ! such was the collection of papers ( left perhaps , as she could then suppose , by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them ) which had filled her with expectation and alarm , and robbed her of half her night ’s rest ! she felt humbled to the dust . Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom ? A corner of it , catching her eye as she lay , seemed to rise up in judgment against her . Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies . To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that , so modern , so habitable!—Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet , the key of which was open to all ! How could she have so imposed on herself ? Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly ! and it was in a great measure his own doing , for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures , she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it . This was the only comfort that occurred . Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly , those detestable papers then scattered over the bed , she rose directly , and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before , returned them to the same spot within the cabinet , with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again , to disgrace her even with herself . Why the locks should have been so difficult to open , however , was still something remarkable , for she could now manage them with perfect ease . In this there was surely something mysterious , and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute , till the possibility of the door ’s having been at first unlocked , and of being herself its fastener , darted into her head , and cost her another blush . She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections , and found her way with all speed to the breakfast - parlour , as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before . Henry was alone in it ; and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest , with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited , was rather distressing . For the world would she not have her weakness suspected , and yet , unequal to an absolute falsehood , was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little . “ But we have a charming morning after it , ”
Catherine Morland	and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over . What beautiful hyacinths ! i have just learnt to love a hyacinth . ”
Catherine Morland	And how might you learn ? By accident or argument ? ”
Catherine Morland	Your sister taught me ; I can not tell how . Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . ”
Catherine Morland	But now you love a hyacinth . So much the better . You have gained a new source of enjoyment , and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible . Besides , a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex , as a means of getting you out of doors , and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take . And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic , who can tell , the sentiment once raised , but you may in time come to love a rose ? ”
Catherine Morland	But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors . The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me , and in fine weather I am out more than half my time . Mamma says I am never within . ”
Catherine Morland	At any rate , however , I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth . The mere habit of learning to love is the thing ; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing . Has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction ? ”
Catherine Morland	Woodston will make but a sombre appearance to - day . ”
Catherine Morland	Is it a pretty place ? ”
Catherine Morland	What say you , Eleanor ? Speak your opinion , for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men . I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations . The house stands among fine meadows facing the south - east , with an excellent kitchen - garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son . It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one . Did Henry ’s income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill - provided for . Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business . But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment . The money is nothing , it is not an object , but employment is the thing . Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession . ”
Catherine Morland	And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . ”
Catherine Morland	But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object . The weather was at present favourable , and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so . Which would she prefer ? He was equally at her service . Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend ’s wishes ? But he thought he could discern . Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland ’s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather . But when did she judge amiss ? The abbey would be always safe and dry . He yielded implicitly , and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment . ”
Catherine Morland	I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father ’s account ; he always walks out at this time of day . ”
Catherine Morland	No , not at all . Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . ”
Catherine Morland	Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then . ”
Catherine Morland	This is so favourite a walk of mine , ”
Catherine Morland	that I always think it the best and nearest way . But perhaps it may be damp . ”
Catherine Morland	I am particularly fond of this spot , ”
Catherine Morland	I used to walk here so often with her ! ”
Catherine Morland	though I never loved it then , as I have loved it since . At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice . But her memory endears it now . ”
Catherine Morland	And ought it not , ”
Catherine Morland	to endear it to her husband ? Yet the General would not enter it . ”
Catherine Morland	Her death must have been a great affliction ! ”
Catherine Morland	A great and increasing one , ”
Catherine Morland	I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . ”
Catherine Morland	I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ”
Catherine Morland	To be sure you must miss him very much . ”
Catherine Morland	A mother would have been always present . A mother would have been a constant friend ; her influence would have been beyond all other . ”
Catherine Morland	Was she a very charming woman ? Was she handsome ? Was there any picture of her in the abbey ? And why had she been so partial to that grove ? Was it from dejection of spirits?”—were questions now eagerly poured forth ; the first three received a ready affirmative , the two others were passed by ; and Catherine ’s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question , whether answered or not . Of her unhappiness in marriage , she felt persuaded . The General certainly had been an unkind husband . He did not love her walk : could he therefore have loved her ? And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . “ Her picture , I suppose , ”
Catherine Morland	hangs in your father ’s room ? ”
Catherine Morland	No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place . Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ”
Catherine Morland	her head did not run upon Bath — much . ”
Catherine Morland	Then you are fretting about General Tilney , and that is very simple of you ; for ten to one whether you ever see him again . You should never fret about trifles . ”
Catherine Morland	I am sure I do not care about the bread . It is all the same to me what I eat . ”
Catherine Morland	There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject , about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance — The Mirror , I think . I will look it out for you some day or other , because I am sure it will do you good . ”
Catherine Morland	would make a sad , heedless young housekeeper to be sure , ” was
Catherine Morland	be a fool if he liked it ! ” The
Catherine Morland	Mrs. Allen , ”
Catherine Morland	will there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney to - day ? I shall not be easy till I have explained everything . ”
Catherine Morland	Go , by all means , my dear ; only put on a white gown ; Miss Tilney always wears white . ”
Catherine Morland	We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in Argyle Street : you were so kind as to look back on purpose . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , do not say Miss Tilney was not angry , ”
Catherine Morland	because I know she was ; for she would not see me this morning when I called ; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it ; I was hurt , but I was not affronted . Perhaps you did not know I had been there . ”
Catherine Morland	I was not within at the time ; but I heard of it from Eleanor , and she has been wishing ever since to see you , to explain the reason of such incivility ; but perhaps I can do it as well . It was nothing more than that my father — they were just preparing to walk out , and he being hurried for time , and not caring to have it put off — made a point of her being denied . That was all , I do assure you . She was very much vexed , and meant to make her apology as soon as possible . ”
Catherine Morland	I angry ! i could have no right . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face . ”
Catherine Morland	How came Mr. Thorpe to know your father ? ”
Catherine Morland	But how came you to know him ? ”
Catherine Morland	Know him ! there are few people much about town that I do not know . I have met him forever at the Bedford ; and I knew his face again to - day the moment he came into the billiard - room . One of the best players we have , by the by ; and we had a little touch together , though I was almost afraid of him at first : the odds were five to four against me ; and , if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world — I took his ball exactly — but I could not make you understand it without a table ; however , I _ did _ beat him . A very fine fellow ; as rich as a Jew . I should like to dine with him ; I dare say he gives famous dinners . But what do you think we have been talking of ? You . Yes , by heavens ! and the General thinks you the finest girl in Bath . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! nonsense ! how can you say so ? ”
Catherine Morland	And what do you think I said?”—lowering his voice—“well done , General , said I ; I am quite of your mind . ”
Catherine Morland	not urge me , Isabella . I am engaged to Miss Tilney . I can not go . ” This
Catherine Morland	would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement , and must only beg to put off the walk till Tuesday . ” “
Catherine Morland	, it would not be easy . I could not do it . There has been no prior engagement . ” But
Catherine Morland	, no , no ! ” was
Catherine Morland	could not be , for Thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on Tuesday . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	, you must go , ” said
Catherine Morland	why can not Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters ? I dare say either of them would like to go . ” “
Catherine Morland	ye , ” cried
Catherine Morland	I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about , and look like a fool . No , if you do not go , d — — me if I do . I only go for the sake of driving you . ” “
Catherine Morland	is a compliment which gives me no pleasure . ” But
Catherine Morland	did not think you had been so obstinate , Catherine , ” said
Catherine Morland	were not used to be so hard to persuade ; you once were the kindest , best - tempered of my sisters . ” “
Catherine Morland	hope I am not less so now , ” she
Catherine Morland	indeed I can not go . If I am wrong , I am doing what I believe to be right . ” “
Catherine Morland	suspect , ” said
Catherine Morland	is no great struggle . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	most heavenly thought indeed ! now , my sweet Catherine , all our distresses are over ; you are honourably acquitted , and we shall have a most delightful party . ” “
Catherine Morland	will not do , ” said
Catherine Morland	can not submit to this . I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right . ” Isabella
Catherine Morland	do not care . Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message . If I had thought it right to put it off , I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself . This is only doing it in a ruder way ; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has — He may be mistaken again perhaps ; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday . Let me go , Mr. Thorpe ; Isabella , do not hold me . ” Thorpe
Catherine Morland	I will go after them , ” said
Catherine Morland	they are I will go after them . It does not signify talking . If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong , I never will be tricked into it . ” And
Catherine Morland	her go , let her go , if she will go . ” “
Catherine Morland	is as obstinate as — ” Thorpe
Catherine Morland	am come in a great hurry — It was all a mistake — I never promised to go — I told them from the first I could not go.—I ran away in a great hurry to explain it.—I did not care what you thought of me.—I would not stay for the servant . ” The
Catherine Morland	did William mean by it ? He should make a point of inquiring into the matter . ” And
Catherine Morland	, no ; Catherine was sure they would not have the least objection , and she should have great pleasure in coming . ” The
Catherine Morland	, ” said
Catherine Morland	do you think of going too ? ” “
Catherine Morland	; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it ; and therefore you know I could not go with them , could I ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, certainly not ; and I am glad you do not think of it . These schemes are not at all the thing . Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages ! now and then it is very well ; but going to inns and public places together ! it is not right ; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it . I am glad you do not think of going ; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased . Mrs. Allen , are not you of my way of thinking ? Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, very much so indeed . Open carriages are nasty things . A clean gown is not five minutes ’ wear in them . You are splashed getting in and getting out ; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction . I hate an open carriage myself . ” “
Catherine Morland	know you do ; but that is not the question . Do not you think it has an odd appearance , if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men , to whom they are not even related ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, my dear , a very odd appearance indeed . I can not bear to see it . ” “
Catherine Morland	why did not you tell me so before ? I am sure if I had known it to be improper , I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all ; but I always hoped you would tell me , if you thought I was doing wrong . ” “
Catherine Morland	this was something of real consequence ; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade . ” “
Catherine Morland	far as it has gone hitherto , there is no harm done , ” said
Catherine Morland	I would only advise you , my dear , not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any more . ” “
Catherine Morland	is just what I was going to say , ” added
Catherine Morland	had better leave her alone , my dear ; she is old enough to know what she is about , and if not , has a mother to advise her . Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt ; but , however , you had better not interfere . She and your brother choose to go , and you will be only getting ill will . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	the day was fine , and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible . ”
Catherine Morland	But how can that be ? ”
Catherine Morland	Are not you with her ? ”
Catherine Morland	Northanger is not more than half my home ; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston , which is nearly twenty miles from my father ’s , and some of my time is necessarily spent there . ”
Catherine Morland	How sorry you must be for that ! ”
Catherine Morland	I am always sorry to leave Eleanor . ”
Catherine Morland	Yes ; but besides your affection for her , you must be so fond of the abbey ! after being used to such a home as the abbey , an ordinary parsonage - house must be very disagreeable . ”
Catherine Morland	You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey . ”
Catherine Morland	To be sure , I have . Is not it a fine old place , just like what one reads about ? ”
Catherine Morland	And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as ‘ what one reads about ’ may produce ? Have you a stout heart ? Nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! yes — I do not think I should be easily frightened , because there would be so many people in the house — and besides , it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years , and then the family come back to it unawares , without giving any notice , as generally happens . ”
Catherine Morland	No , certainly . We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire — nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows , doors , or furniture . But you must be aware that when a young lady is ( by whatever means ) introduced into a dwelling of this kind , she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family . While they snugly repair to their own end of the house , she is formally conducted by Dorothy , the ancient housekeeper , up a different staircase , and along many gloomy passages , into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before . Can you stand such a ceremony as this ? Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber — too lofty and extensive for you , with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size — its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life , and the bed , of dark green stuff or purple velvet , presenting even a funereal appearance ? Will not your heart sink within you ? ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! but this will not happen to me , I am sure . ”
Catherine Morland	How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment ! and what will you discern ? Not tables , toilettes , wardrobes , or drawers , but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute , on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open , and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior , whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you , that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it . Dorothy , meanwhile , no less struck by your appearance , gazes on you in great agitation , and drops a few unintelligible hints . To raise your spirits , moreover , she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted , and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call . With this parting cordial she curtsies off — you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you — and when , with fainting spirits , you attempt to fasten your door , you discover , with increased alarm , that it has no lock . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh ! mr . Tilney , how frightful ! this is just like a book ! but it can not really happen to me . I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy . Well , what then ? ”
Catherine Morland	Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night . After surmounting your _ unconquerable _ horror of the bed , you will retire to rest , and get a few hours ’ unquiet slumber . But on the second , or at farthest the _ third _ night after your arrival , you will probably have a violent storm . Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains — and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it , you will probably think you discern ( for your lamp is not extinguished ) one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest . Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it , you will instantly arise , and throwing your dressing - gown around you , proceed to examine this mystery . After a very short search , you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection , and on opening it , a door will immediately appear — which door , being only secured by massy bars and a padlock , you will , after a few efforts , succeed in opening — and , with your lamp in your hand , will pass through it into a small vaulted room . ”
Catherine Morland	No , indeed ; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing . ”
Catherine Morland	What ! not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony , scarcely two miles off . Could you shrink from so simple an adventure ? No , no , you will proceed into this small vaulted room , and through this into several others , without perceiving anything very remarkable in either . In one perhaps there may be a dagger , in another a few drops of blood , and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture ; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way , and your lamp being nearly exhausted , you will return towards your own apartment . In repassing through the small vaulted room , however , your eyes will be attracted towards a large , old - fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold , which , though narrowly examining the furniture before , you had passed unnoticed . Impelled by an irresistible presentiment , you will eagerly advance to it , unlock its folding doors , and search into every drawer — but for some time without discovering anything of importance — perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds . At last , however , by touching a secret spring , an inner compartment will open — a roll of paper appears — you seize it — it contains many sheets of manuscript — you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber , but scarcely have you been able to decipher ‘ Oh thou , whomsoever thou mayst be , into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall’—when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket , and leaves you in total darkness . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , no , no ; do not say so . Well , go on . ”
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney , she was sure , would never put her into such a chamber as he had described ! she was not at all afraid . ”
Catherine Morland	is strange indeed ! i did not expect such a sight as this ! an immense heavy chest ! what can it hold ? Why should it be placed here ? Pushed back too , as if meant to be out of sight ! i will look into it — cost me what it may , I will look into it — and directly too — by daylight . If I stay till evening my candle may go out . ” She
Catherine Morland	is a curious old chest , is not it ? ” said
Catherine Morland	is impossible to say how many generations it has been here . How it came to be first put in this room I know not , but I have not had it moved , because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets . The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open . In that corner , however , it is at least out of the way . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	much better is this , ” said
Catherine Morland	should take her time ; she should not hurry herself ; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house . But she would not make up her fire ; _ that _ would seem cowardly , as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed . ” The
Catherine Morland	from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet , and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far , it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it . ” It
Catherine Morland	and for all our intimacy ! she must think me an idiot , or she could not have written so ; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her . I see what she has been about . She is a vain coquette , and her tricks have not answered . I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her . ”
Catherine Morland	Oh , dear ! ”
Catherine Morland	I know you very well ; you have so much animation , which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants , for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her . Oh ! i must tell you , that just after we parted yesterday , I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly — I am sure he is in love with you . ”
Catherine Morland	Do you indeed ! you surprise me ; I thought it had not been readable . But , my dearest Catherine , have you settled what to wear on your head to - night ? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you . The men take notice of _ that _ sometimes , you know . ”
Catherine Morland	But it does not signify if they do , ”
Catherine Morland	I detest them . ” But
Catherine Morland	! mr . Morland and my brother ! ” “
Catherine Morland	heaven ! ’ Tis James ! ” was
Catherine Morland	do not know the distance . ” Her
Catherine Morland	Three_-and - twenty ! ” cried
Catherine Morland	- and - twenty if it is an inch . ” Morland
Catherine Morland	o’clock ! it was eleven , upon my soul ! i counted every stroke . This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses , Miss Morland ; do but look at my horse ; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life ? ” (
Catherine Morland	true blood ! three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles ! look at that creature , and suppose it possible if you can . ” “
Catherine Morland	_ does _ look very hot , to be sure . ” “
Catherine Morland	! he had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church ; but look at his forehand ; look at his loins ; only see how he moves ; that horse _ can not _ go less than ten miles an hour : tie his legs and he will get on . What do you think of my gig , Miss Morland ? A neat one , is not it ? Well hung ; town - built ; I have not had it a month . It was built for a Christchurch man , a friend of mine , a very good sort of fellow ; he ran it a few weeks , till , I believe , it was convenient to have done with it . I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind , though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too ; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge , as he was driving into Oxford , last term : ‘ Ah ! thorpe , ’ said he , ‘ do you happen to want such a little thing as this ? It is a capital one of the kind , but I am cursed tired of it . ’ ‘ Oh ! d — , ’ said I ; ‘ I am your man ; what do you ask ? ’ And how much do you think he did , Miss Morland ? ” “
Catherine Morland	- hung , you see ; seat , trunk , sword - case , splashing - board , lamps , silver moulding , all you see complete ; the iron - work as good as new , or better . He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . ” “
Catherine Morland	I am sure , ” said
Catherine Morland	know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . ” “
Catherine Morland	one nor t’other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . ” “
Catherine Morland	was very good - natured of you , ” said
Catherine Morland	will find , however , Miss Morland , it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people , for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day ; Jackson , of Oriel , bid me sixty at once ; Morland was with me at the time . ” “
Catherine Morland	, ” said
Catherine Morland	you forget that your horse was included . ” “
Catherine Morland	horse ! oh , d — — it ! i would not sell my horse for a hundred . Are you fond of an open carriage , Miss Morland ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, very ; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one ; but I am particularly fond of it . ” “
Catherine Morland	am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . ” “
Catherine Morland	you indeed ! ” said
Catherine Morland	will be forty miles a day . ” “
Catherine Morland	! aye , fifty , for what I care . Well , I will drive you up Lansdown to - morrow ; mind , I am engaged . ” “
Catherine Morland	dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother , you will not have room for a third . ” “
Catherine Morland	you ever read Udolpho , Mr. Thorpe ? ” “
Catherine Morland	! oh , Lord ! not I ; I never read novels ; I have something else to do . ” Catherine
Catherine Morland	are all so full of nonsense and stuff ; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones , except The Monk ; I read that t’other day ; but as for all the others , they are the stupidest things in creation . ” “
Catherine Morland	think you must like Udolpho , if you were to read it ; it is so very interesting . ” “
Catherine Morland	I , faith ! no , if I read any , it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe ’s ; her novels are amusing enough ; they are worth reading ; some fun and nature in _ them _ . ” “
Catherine Morland	, sure ; was it ? Aye , I remember , so it was ; I was thinking of that other stupid book , written by that woman they make such a fuss about , she who married the French emigrant . ” “
Catherine Morland	suppose you mean Camilla ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, that ’s the book ; such unnatural stuff ! an old man playing at see - saw , I took up the first volume once and looked it over , but I soon found it would not do ; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it : as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant , I was sure I should never be able to get through it . ” “
Catherine Morland	have never read it . ” “
Catherine Morland	had no loss , I assure you ; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine ; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man ’s playing at see - saw and learning Latin ; upon my soul there is not . ” This
Catherine Morland	, Catherine , how do you like my friend Thorpe ? ” instead
Catherine Morland	do not like him at all , ” she
Catherine Morland	like him very much ; he seems very agreeable . ” “
Catherine Morland	is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, very much indeed : Isabella particularly . ” “
Catherine Morland	am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you . She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be ; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you , Catherine , ” taking
Catherine Morland	be proud of . ” “
Catherine Morland	I am , ” she
Catherine Morland	love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too . You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . ” “
Catherine Morland	I thought I should soon see you myself . I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath . She is a most amiable girl ; such a superior understanding ! how fond all the family are of her ; she is evidently the general favourite ; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this — is not she ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, very much indeed , I fancy ; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath . ” “
Catherine Morland	dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? ” “
Catherine Morland	, very kind ; I never was so happy before ; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever ; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _ me _ . ” James
General Tilney	Eleanor ”
General Tilney	My father only wanted me to answer a note , ”
General Tilney	We are not calling it a good house , ”
General Tilney	I trust , ”
General Tilney	that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady ’s taste ! ”
General Tilney	I really have not patience with the General , ”
General Tilney	am very sorry for it , ” said
General Tilney	I had known this before — ” “
General Tilney	, ” said
General Tilney	would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ” The
General Tilney	How handsome a family they are ! ”
General Tilney	that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ”
General Tilney	This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother ’s fortitude , ”
General Tilney	without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom . If he had a hobby - horse , it was _ that _ . He loved a garden . Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit — or if he did not , his friends and children did . There were great vexations , however , attending such a garden as his . The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits . The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year . Mr. Allen , he supposed , must feel these inconveniences as well as himself . ”
General Tilney	How were Mr. Allen ’s succession - houses worked ? ”
General Tilney	He is a happy man ! ”
General Tilney	But where are you going , Eleanor ? Why do you choose that cold , damp path to it ? Miss Morland will get wet . Our best way is across the park . ”
General Tilney	The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . ”
General Tilney	It was my mother ’s favourite walk . ”
General Tilney	friends from Fullerton . ” She
General Tilney	I can close my eyes , and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep . Can either of us be more meetly employed ? _ My _ eyes will be blinding for the good of others , and _ yours _ preparing by rest for future mischief . ” But
General Tilney	We are not calling it a good house , ”
General Tilney	I trust , ”
General Tilney	that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady ’s taste ! ”
General Tilney	our friends from Fullerton . ”
General Tilney	Your Ladyship ! ”
General Tilney	How glad I shall be when you are all off . ”
General Tilney	Eleanor ”
General Tilney	My father only wanted me to answer a note , ”
General Tilney	This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother ’s fortitude , ”
General Tilney	without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom . If he had a hobby - horse , it was _ that _ . He loved a garden . Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit — or if he did not , his friends and children did .

General Tilney	He is a happy man ! ”
General Tilney	But where are you going , Eleanor ? Why do you choose that cold , damp path to it ? Miss Morland will get wet . Our best way is across the park . ”

General Tilney	Ladyship ! ” Her
General Tilney	How glad I shall be when you are all off . ”
General Tilney	she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ” “
Eleanor Tilney	Mr. Tilney ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	Good God ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	And may I not , in my turn , ”
Eleanor Tilney	ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . ”
Eleanor Tilney	My mother ’s room ! is there anything extraordinary to be seen there ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	No , nothing at all . I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . ”
Eleanor Tilney	As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity , this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother ’s character , as described by Eleanor , which does honour to her memory . The world , I believe , never saw a better woman . But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this . The domestic , unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent , venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours . Eleanor , I suppose , has talked of her a great deal ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	and you — none of you being at home — and your father , I thought — perhaps had not been very fond of her . ”
Eleanor Tilney	And from these circumstances , ”
Eleanor Tilney	you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence — some”—(involuntarily she shook her head)—“or it may be — of something still less pardonable . ”
Eleanor Tilney	My mother ’s illness , ”
Eleanor Tilney	the seizure which ended in her death , _ was _ sudden . The malady itself , one from which she had often suffered , a bilious fever — its cause therefore constitutional . On the third day , in short , as soon as she could be prevailed on , a physician attended her , a very respectable man , and one in whom she had always placed great confidence . Upon his opinion of her danger , two others were called in the next day , and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours . On the fifth day she died . During the progress of her disorder , Frederick and I ( _ we _ were both at home ) saw her repeatedly ; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her , or which her situation in life could command . Poor Eleanor was absent , and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin . ”
Eleanor Tilney	the end of another week ! ” “
Eleanor Tilney	Yes , sometimes ; but he has rid out this morning with my father . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Shall you be at the cotillion ball to - morrow ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	I am glad of it , for we shall all be there . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ”
Eleanor Tilney	hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time — had been misled ( perhaps by her wishes ) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised — and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there , they would be too generous to hasten her return . ”
Eleanor Tilney	My dear Catherine , you must not — you must not indeed — ”
Eleanor Tilney	’ Tis a messenger from Woodston ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	You are mistaken , indeed , ”
Eleanor Tilney	it is no one from Woodston . It is my father himself . ”
Eleanor Tilney	I shall see you in the morning . ”
Eleanor Tilney	think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was . I must show it you some day or other . Bath is a nice place , Catherine , after all . I assure you I did not above half like coming away . Mrs. Thorpe ’s being there was such a comfort to us , was not it ? You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . ” “
Eleanor Tilney	He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Where can he be ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	By the end of another week ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	I am very sorry for it , ”
Eleanor Tilney	if I had known this before — ”
Eleanor Tilney	Perhaps , ”
Eleanor Tilney	you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ”
Eleanor Tilney	Since they can consent to part with you , ”
Eleanor Tilney	we may expect philosophy from all the world . ”
Eleanor Tilney	But , ”
Eleanor Tilney	would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ? She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so . And how strange an infatuation on Frederick ’s side ! a girl who , before his eyes , is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man ! is not it inconceivable , Henry ? Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly ! who found no woman good enough to be loved ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , ”
Eleanor Tilney	Mr. Tilney ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	Good God ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	And may I not , in my turn , ”
Eleanor Tilney	ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . ”
Eleanor Tilney	My mother ’s room ! is there anything extraordinary to be seen there ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	No , nothing at all . I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . ”
Eleanor Tilney	As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity , this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother ’s character , as described by Eleanor , which does honour to her memory . The world , I believe , never saw a better woman . But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this . The domestic , unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent , venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours . Eleanor , I suppose , has talked of her a great deal ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	and you — none of you being at home — and your father , I thought — perhaps had not been very fond of her . ”
Eleanor Tilney	And from these circumstances , ”
Eleanor Tilney	you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence — some”—(involuntarily she shook her head)—“or it may be — of something still less pardonable . ”
Eleanor Tilney	My mother ’s illness , ”
Eleanor Tilney	the seizure which ended in her death , _ was _ sudden . The malady itself , one from which she had often suffered , a bilious fever — its cause therefore constitutional . On the third day , in short , as soon as she could be prevailed on , a physician attended her , a very respectable man , and one in whom she had always placed great confidence . Upon his opinion of her danger , two others were called in the next day , and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours . On the fifth day she died . During the progress of her disorder , Frederick and I ( _ we _ were both at home ) saw her repeatedly ; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her , or which her situation in life could command . Poor Eleanor was absent , and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin . ”
Eleanor Tilney	perhaps , ” observed
Eleanor Tilney	hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time — had been misled ( perhaps by her wishes ) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised — and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there , they would be too generous to hasten her return . ”
Eleanor Tilney	My dear Catherine , you must not — you must not indeed — ”
Eleanor Tilney	’ Tis a messenger from Woodston ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	You are mistaken , indeed , ”
Eleanor Tilney	it is no one from Woodston . It is my father himself . ”
Eleanor Tilney	I shall see you in the morning . ”
Eleanor Tilney	He is a fine old fellow , upon my soul ! stout , active — looks as young as his son . I have a great regard for him , I assure you : a gentleman - like , good sort of fellow as ever lived . ”
Henry Tilney	It is only a quarter past four , ”
Henry Tilney	and you are not now in Bath . No theatre , no rooms to prepare for . Half an hour at Northanger must be enough . ”
Henry Tilney	to James on her behalf ! no , James should never hear Isabella ’s name mentioned by her again . ” On
Henry Tilney	will soon be as if you never had , ” said
Henry Tilney	is but one thing that I can not understand . I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time . Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ? ” “
Henry Tilney	have very little to say for Frederick ’s motives , such as I believe them to have been . He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself . If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . ” “
Henry Tilney	you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ? ” “
Henry Tilney	am persuaded that he never did . ” “
Henry Tilney	only made believe to do so for mischief ’s sake ? ” Henry
Henry Tilney	, then , I must say that I do not like him at all . Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all . As it happens , there is no great harm done , because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose . But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? ” “
Henry Tilney	if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe . But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . ” Catherine
Henry Tilney	You may see the house from this window , sir , ”
Henry Tilney	, ” but
Henry Tilney	much the worse ! ” thought
Henry Tilney	You have been abroad then ? ”
Henry Tilney	Very true , ”
Henry Tilney	and this is a very nice day , and we are taking a very nice walk , and you are two very nice young ladies . Oh ! it is a very nice word indeed ! it does for everything . Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness , propriety , delicacy , or refinement — people were nice in their dress , in their sentiments , or their choice . But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word . ”
Henry Tilney	That little boys and girls should be tormented , ”
Henry Tilney	is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny ; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians , I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim , and that by their method and style , they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life . I use the verb ‘ to torment , ’ as I observed to be your own method , instead of ‘ to instruct , ’ supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous . ”
Henry Tilney	You think me foolish to call instruction a torment , but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell , if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together , and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it , as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home , you would allow that to _ torment _ and to _ instruct _ might sometimes be used as synonymous words . ”
Henry Tilney	Very probably . But historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read ; and even you yourself , who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe , very intense application , may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth - while to be tormented for two or three years of one ’s life , for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it . Consider — if reading had not been taught , Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain — or perhaps might not have written at all . ”
Henry Tilney	I have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London . ”
Henry Tilney	Government , ”
Henry Tilney	neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters . There must be murder ; and government cares not how much . ”
Henry Tilney	Come , shall I make you understand each other , or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can ? No — I will be noble . I will prove myself a man , no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head . I have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours . Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute — neither vigorous nor keen . Perhaps they may want observation , discernment , judgment , fire , genius , and wit . ”
Henry Tilney	am sure my brother would not wish to do that . ” “
Henry Tilney	is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him . I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged . He knows what he is about , and must be his own master . ” “
Henry Tilney	Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us . His leave of absence will soon expire , and he must return to his regiment . And what will then be their acquaintance ? The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ” Catherine
Henry Tilney	dearest Catherine . ”
Henry Tilney	you been long in Bath , madam ? ” “
Henry Tilney	! ” with
Henry Tilney	, indeed ! ” said
Henry Tilney	some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply , and surprise is more easily assumed , and not less reasonable than any other . Now let us go on . Were you never here before , madam ? ” “
Henry Tilney	! have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms ? ” “
Henry Tilney	, sir , I was there last Monday . ” “
Henry Tilney	I must give one smirk , and then we may be rational again . ” Catherine
Henry Tilney	I am sorry , ”
Henry Tilney	if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . ”
Henry Tilney	To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , ”
Henry Tilney	must be a comfort to him under any distress . ”
Henry Tilney	Our brother ! frederick ! ”
Henry Tilney	Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ”
Henry Tilney	Indeed I am afraid she will , ”
Henry Tilney	I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance . I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . ”
Henry Tilney	It is only a quarter past four , ”
Henry Tilney	and you are not now in Bath . No theatre , no rooms to prepare for . Half an hour at Northanger must be enough . ”
Henry Tilney	am sorry , ” said
Henry Tilney	I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . ” “
Henry Tilney	quick you are ! ” cried
Henry Tilney	have guessed it , I declare ! And yet , when we talked about it in Bath , you little thought of its ending so . Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours ! could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ” “
Henry Tilney	I am afraid she will , ” replied
Henry Tilney	am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance . I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . ” “
Henry Tilney	Oh ! mr . Tilney , I have been quite wild to speak to you , and make my apologies . You must have thought me so rude ; but indeed it was not my own fault , was it , Mrs. Allen ? Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together ? And then what could I do ? But I had ten thousand times rather have been with you ; now had not I , Mrs. Allen ? ”
Henry Tilney	But , Mr. Tilney , why were _ you _ less generous than your sister ? If she felt such confidence in my good intentions , and could suppose it to be only a mistake , why should _ you _ be so ready to take offence ? ”
Henry Tilney	Me ! i take offence ! ”
Henry Tilney	Nay , I am sure by your look , when you came into the box , you were angry . ”
Henry Tilney	It will soon be as if you never had , ”
Henry Tilney	I am persuaded that he never did . ”
Henry Tilney	And only made believe to do so for mischief ’s sake ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	It was all pride , pride , insufferable haughtiness and pride ! she had long suspected the family to be very high , and this made it certain . Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney ’s she had never heard of in her life ! not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding ! to behave to her guest with such superciliousness ! hardly even to speak to her ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	Your brother will not mind it , I know , ”
Isabella Thorpe	because I heard him say before that he hated dancing ; but it was very good - natured in him to think of it . I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down , and fancied she might wish for a partner ; but he is quite mistaken , for she would not dance upon any account in the world . ”
Isabella Thorpe	I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle ! amusing enough , if my mind had been disengaged ; but I would have given the world to sit still . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Then why did not you ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	It is very charming indeed , ”
Isabella Thorpe	I only wish I could do as much . One could not expect more from him , you know . If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man . Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed , but your wishes , my dear Isabella , are so moderate , you do not consider how little you ever want , my dear . ”
Isabella Thorpe	been forming a very bold wish . We leave Bath , as she has perhaps told you , on Saturday se’nnight . A letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home ; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here , some of my very old friends , there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath . And could we carry our selfish point with you , we should leave it without a single regret . Can you , in short , be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire ? I am almost ashamed to make the request , though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself . Modesty such as yours — but not for the world would I pain it by open praise . If you can be induced to honour us with a visit , you will make us happy beyond expression . ’ Tis true , we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place ; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour , for our mode of living , as you see , is plain and unpretending ; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable . ” Northanger
Isabella Thorpe	Do not be frightened , my dear Catherine , ”
Isabella Thorpe	but I am really going to dance with your brother again . I declare positively it is quite shocking . I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself , but you and John must keep us in countenance . Make haste , my dear creature , and come to us . John is just walked off , but he will be back in a moment . ”
Isabella Thorpe	, my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare ! they are coming for me perhaps — but I shall not go — I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . ” Mrs.
Isabella Thorpe	dearest Catherine , you can not form an idea of the dirt ; come , you must go ; you can not refuse going now . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	It was all pride , pride , insufferable haughtiness and pride ! she had long suspected the family to be very high , and this made it certain . Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney ’s she had never heard of in her life ! not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding ! to behave to her guest with such superciliousness ! hardly even to speak to her ! ”

If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man . Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed , but your wishes , my dear Isabella , are so moderate , you do not consider how little you ever want , my dear . ”
Isabella Thorpe	, my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you . Oh , that arch eye of yours ! it sees through everything . ” Catherine
Isabella Thorpe	, my beloved , sweetest friend , ” continued
Isabella Thorpe	! my sweet Catherine , in _ your _ generous heart I know it would signify nothing ; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many . As for myself , I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed . Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . ” This
Isabella Thorpe	my own part , ” said
Isabella Thorpe	wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me . Where people are really attached , poverty itself is wealth ; grandeur I detest : I would not settle in London for the universe . A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy . There are some charming little villas about Richmond . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	! ” cried
Isabella Thorpe	must settle near Fullerton . You must be near us . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	am sure I shall be miserable if we do not . If I can but be near _ you _ , I shall be satisfied . But this is idle talking ! i will not allow myself to think of such things , till we have your father ’s answer . Morland says that by sending it to - night to Salisbury , we may have it to - morrow . To - morrow ? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter . I know it will be the death of me . ” A
Isabella Thorpe	have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents , and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness , ” were
Isabella Thorpe	John ” and
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine ” at
Isabella Thorpe	Anne and dear Maria ” must
Isabella Thorpe	” at
Isabella Thorpe	Do not be uneasy , Isabella , James will soon be here . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Psha ! my dear creature , ”
Isabella Thorpe	I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been . All that is best known to yourself . A little harmless flirtation or so will occur , and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by . But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely . All those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits . What one means one day , you know , one may not mean the next . Circumstances change , opinions alter . ”
Isabella Thorpe	My dearest Catherine , ”
Isabella Thorpe	I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about . I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother , because he is my brother , and who perhaps after all , you know , might be just as happy without you , for people seldom know what they would be at , young men especially , they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant . What I say is , why should a brother ’s happiness be dearer to me than a friend ’s ? You know I carry my notions of friendship pretty high . But , above all things , my dear Catherine , do not be in a hurry . Take my word for it , that if you are in too great a hurry , you will certainly live to repent it . Tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections , and I believe he is very right . Ah ! here he comes ; never mind , he will not see us , I am sure . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Psha , nonsense ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	Why do you put such things into my head ? If I could believe it — my spirit , you know , is pretty independent . ”
Isabella Thorpe	I wish your heart were independent . That would be enough for me . ”
Isabella Thorpe	My heart , indeed ! what can you have to do with hearts ? You men have none of you any hearts . ”
Isabella Thorpe	If we have not hearts , we have eyes ; and they give us torment enough . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Do they ? I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me . I will look another way . I hope this pleases you ”
Isabella Thorpe	Never more so ; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view — at once too much and too little . ”
Isabella Thorpe	he ? Then why does he stay here ? ” He
Isabella Thorpe	you will persuade him to go away ? ” “
Isabella Thorpe	are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ” “
Isabella Thorpe	, very sure . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	it my brother ’s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe ’s admission of them , that gives the pain ? ” “
Isabella Thorpe	not it the same thing ? ” “
Isabella Thorpe	think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference . No man is offended by another man ’s admiration of the woman he loves ; it is the woman only who can make it a torment . ” Catherine
Isabella Thorpe	no , not flirts . A woman in love with one man can not flirt with another . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	what can your brother mean ? If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? ” “
Isabella Thorpe	are a very close questioner . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	I ? I only ask what I want to be told . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? ” “
Isabella Thorpe	, I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	? ” “
Isabella Thorpe	! nay , if it is to be guesswork , let us all guess for ourselves . To be guided by second - hand conjecture is pitiful . The premises are before you . My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week ’s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	, ” said
Isabella Thorpe	I assure you , ”
Isabella Thorpe	I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world ; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head , ”
Isabella Thorpe	Oh ! heavens ! you do n’t say so ! let me look at her this moment . What a delightful girl ! i never saw anything half so beautiful ! but where is her all - conquering brother ? Is he in the room ? Point him out to me this instant , if he is . I die to see him . Mr. Morland , you are not to listen . We are not talking about you . ”
Isabella Thorpe	There , ”
Isabella Thorpe	you hear what your sister says , and yet you will not mind her . Well , remember that it is not my fault , if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle . Come along , my dearest Catherine , for heaven ’s sake , and stand by me . ”
Isabella Thorpe	dearest creature , ” cried
Isabella Thorpe	have been at least three hours getting ready . I was afraid you were ill . What a delightful ball we had last night . I have a thousand things to say to you ; but make haste and get in , for I long to be off . ” Catherine
Isabella Thorpe	Do not be uneasy , Isabella , James will soon be here . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Psha ! my dear creature , ”
Isabella Thorpe	I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been . All that is best known to yourself . A little harmless flirtation or so will occur , and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by . But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely . All those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits .

Isabella Thorpe	My dearest Catherine , ”
Isabella Thorpe	I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about . I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother , because he is my brother , and who perhaps after all , you know , might be just as happy without you , for people seldom know what they would be at , young men especially , they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant .

Isabella Thorpe	Never more so ; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view — at once too much and too little . ”
Isabella Thorpe	can not help being jealous , Catherine , when I see myself slighted for strangers , I , who love you so excessively ! when once my affections are placed , it is not in the power of anything to change them . But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody ’s ; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace ; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick , I own . These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else . ” Catherine
Isabella Thorpe	, Catherine . I think you can not stand out any longer now . The sacrifice is not much ; and to oblige such a friend — I shall think you quite unkind , if you still refuse . ” This
Isabella Thorpe	well , then there is an end of the party . If Catherine does not go , I can not . I can not be the only woman . I would not , upon any account in the world , do so improper a thing . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	Write to James on her behalf ! no , James should never hear Isabella ’s name mentioned by her again . ”
Isabella Thorpe	There is but one thing that I can not understand . I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time . Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	I have very little to say for Frederick ’s motives , such as I believe them to have been . He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself . If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	Well , then , I must say that I do not like him at all . Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all . As it happens , there is no great harm done , because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose . But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose — consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . ”
Isabella Thorpe	It is very right that you should stand by your brother . ”
Isabella Thorpe	And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe . But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Have you , indeed ! i am very sorry for it ; but really I thought I was in very good time . It is but just one . I hope you have not been here long ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	Oh ! these ten ages at least . I am sure I have been here this half hour . But now , let us go and sit down at the other end of the room , and enjoy ourselves . I have an hundred things to say to you . In the first place , I was so afraid it would rain this morning , just as I wanted to set off ; it looked very showery , and that would have thrown me into agonies ! do you know , I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine , in a shop window in Milsom Street just now — very like yours , only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green ; I quite longed for it . But , my dearest Catherine , what have you been doing with yourself all this morning ? Have you gone on with Udolpho ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	Yes , I have been reading it ever since I woke ; and I am got to the black veil . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Are you , indeed ? How delightful ! oh ! i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world ! are not you wild to know ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	Oh ! yes , quite ; what can it be ? But do not tell me — I would not be told upon any account . I know it must be a skeleton , I am sure it is Laurentina ’s skeleton . Oh ! i am delighted with the book ! i should like to spend my whole life in reading it . I assure you , if it had not been to meet you , I would not have come away from it for all the world . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Dear creature ! how much I am obliged to you ; and when you have finished Udolpho , we will read the Italian together ; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Have you , indeed ! how glad I am ! what are they all ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	I will read you their names directly ; here they are , in my pocketbook . Castle of Wolfenbach , Clermont , Mysterious Warnings , Necromancer of the Black Forest , Midnight Bell , Orphan of the Rhine , and Horrid Mysteries . Those will last us some time . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Yes , pretty well ; but are they all horrid , are you sure they are all horrid ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	Yes , quite sure ; for a particular friend of mine , a Miss Andrews , a sweet girl , one of the sweetest creatures in the world , has read every one of them . I wish you knew Miss Andrews , you would be delighted with her . She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive . I think her as beautiful as an angel , and I am so vexed with the men for not admiring her ! i scold them all amazingly about it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Scold them ! do you scold them for not admiring her ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	Yes , that I do . There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends . I have no notion of loving people by halves ; it is not my nature . My attachments are always excessively strong . I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night , I would not dance with him , unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel . The men think us incapable of real friendship , you know , and I am determined to show them the difference . Now , if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you , I should fire up in a moment : but that is not at all likely , for _ you _ are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men . ”
Isabella Thorpe	How can you say so ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	It is very true , upon my honour , but I see how it is ; you are indifferent to everybody ’s admiration , except that of one gentleman , who shall be nameless . Nay , I can not blame you”—speaking more seriously—“your feelings are easily understood . Where the heart is really attached , I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else . Everything is so insipid , so uninteresting , that does not relate to the beloved object ! i can perfectly comprehend your feelings . ”
Isabella Thorpe	But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney , for perhaps I may never see him again . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Not see him again ! my dearest creature , do not talk of it . I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	No , indeed , I should not . I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him ; but while I have Udolpho to read , I feel as if nobody could make me miserable . Oh ! the dreadful black veil ! my dear Isabella , I am sure there must be Laurentina ’s skeleton behind it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	It is so odd to me , that you should never have read Udolpho before ; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels . ”
Isabella Thorpe	No , she does not . She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself ; but new books do not fall in our way . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Sir Charles Grandison ! that is an amazing horrid book , is it not ? I remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume . ”
Isabella Thorpe	It is not like Udolpho at all ; but yet I think it is very entertaining . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Signify ! oh , heavens ! i make it a rule never to mind what they say . They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit , and make them keep their distance . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Are they ? Well , I never observed _ that _ . They always behave very well to me . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Oh ! they give themselves such airs . They are the most conceited creatures in the world , and think themselves of so much importance ! by the by , though I have thought of it a hundred times , I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man . Do you like them best dark or fair ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	I hardly know . I never much thought about it . Something between both , I think . Brown — not fair , and — and not very dark . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Very well , Catherine . That is exactly he . I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney—‘a brown skin , with dark eyes , and rather dark hair . ’ Well , my taste is different . I prefer light eyes , and as to complexion — do you know — I like a sallow better than any other . You must not betray me , if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Betray you ! what do you mean ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	Nay , do not distress me . I believe I have said too much . Let us drop the subject . ”
Isabella Thorpe	For heaven ’s sake ! Let us move away from this end of the room . Do you know , there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour . They really put me quite out of countenance . Let us go and look at the arrivals . They will hardly follow us there . ”
Isabella Thorpe	And which way are they gone ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	One was a very good - looking young man . ”
Isabella Thorpe	They went towards the church - yard . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them ! and now , what say you to going to Edgar ’s Buildings with me , and looking at my new hat ? You said you should like to see it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Only , ”
Isabella Thorpe	perhaps we may overtake the two young men . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Oh ! never mind that . If we make haste , we shall pass by them presently , and I am dying to show you my hat . ”
Isabella Thorpe	But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . ”
Isabella Thorpe	I shall not pay them any such compliment , I assure you . I have no notion of treating men with such respect . _ That _ is the way to spoil them . ”
Isabella Thorpe	know it must be five - and - twenty , ” said
Isabella Thorpe	the time we have been doing it . It is now half after one ; we drove out of the inn - yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven ; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness ; that makes it exactly twenty - five . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	have lost an hour , ” said
Isabella Thorpe	was only ten o’clock when we came from Tetbury . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	am sure I can not guess at all . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	! d — — it , when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend , I hate to be pitiful . ” An
Isabella Thorpe	you , ” said
Isabella Thorpe	will drive you up Lansdown Hill to - morrow . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	you ; but will not your horse want rest ? ” “
Isabella Thorpe	! he has only come three and twenty miles to - day ; all nonsense ; nothing ruins horses so much as rest ; nothing knocks them up so soon . No , no ; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here . ” “
Isabella Thorpe	delightful that will be ! ” cried
Isabella Thorpe	, Mother ! How do you do ? ” said
Isabella Thorpe	did you get that quiz of a hat ? It makes you look like an old witch . Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you , so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near . ” And
Isabella Thorpe	, Catherine , I love you dearly . ” Inquiries
John Thorpe	Heyday , Miss Morland ! ”
John Thorpe	you indeed ? ” “
John Thorpe	upon my soul ; knew him again directly , and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too . ” “
John Thorpe	is all one to me , ” replied
John Thorpe	brother does know it , ” was
John Thorpe	, he does not know what he is about , ” cried
John Thorpe	does not know the pain he is giving my brother . Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . ” “
John Thorpe	, I have settled the matter , and now we may all go to - morrow with a safe conscience . I have been to Miss Tilney , and made your excuses . ” “
John Thorpe	have not ! ” cried
John Thorpe	have , upon my soul . Left her this moment . Told her you had sent me to say that , having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us to - morrow , you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday . She said very well , Tuesday was just as convenient to her ; so there is an end of all our difficulties . A pretty good thought of mine — hey ? ” Isabella
John Thorpe	long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury , Miss Morland ? ” “
John Thorpe	was written by Mrs. Radcliffe , ” said
Frederick Tilney	No , ”
Frederick Tilney	my father ’s hands need not be strengthened , and Frederick ’s confession of folly need not be forestalled . He must tell his own story . ”
Frederick Tilney	No , ”
Frederick Tilney	my father ’s hands need not be strengthened , and Frederick ’s confession of folly need not be forestalled . He must tell his own story . ”
Frederick Tilney	My brother does know it , ”
Frederick Tilney	My dear Miss Morland , ”
Frederick Tilney	in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? Are you not carried a little too far ? Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ? Is he safe only in solitude ? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ? He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it . I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can . You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend ; depend upon it , therefore , that real jealousy never can exist between them ; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration . Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ”
Frederick Tilney	is the most unpromising circumstance , the strongest presumption against him . When I think of his past declarations , I give him up . Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe ’s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured . It is all over with Frederick indeed ! he is a deceased man — defunct in understanding . Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . ” “
Frederick Tilney	a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , ” said
Mrs. Allen	Only think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was . I must show it you some day or other . Bath is a nice place , Catherine , after all . I assure you I did not above half like coming away . Mrs. Thorpe ’s being there was such a comfort to us , was not it ? You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . ”
Mrs. Allen	, ” replied
Mrs. Allen	know you never mind dirt . ” After
Mrs. Allen	comes on faster and faster ! ” said
Mrs. Allen	croaking fellow ! ” cried
Mrs. Allen	Allen , you must persuade her to go , ” was
Mrs. Allen	you go . ” And
Mrs. Allen	What a delightful place Bath is , ”
Mrs. Allen	and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here . ”
Mrs. Allen	despair of nothing we would attain , ”
Mrs. Allen	My dear Mrs. Allen , I long to introduce them ; they will be so delighted to see you : the tallest is Isabella , my eldest ; is not she a fine young woman ? The others are very much admired too , but I believe Isabella is the handsomest . ”
Mrs. Allen	wish we had some acquaintance in Bath ! ” They
Mrs. Allen	This is my favourite place , ”
Mrs. Allen	it is so out of the way . ”
Mrs. Allen	Did you meet Mr. Tilney , my dear ? ”
Mrs. Allen	was said about it , I remember , ” said
Mrs. Allen	really I did not expect you . ” “
Mrs. Allen	expect me ! that ’s a good one ! and what a dust you would have made , if I had not come . ” Catherine
Mrs. Allen	three o’clock ! ” It
Mrs. Allen	, my dear , here you are , ” a
Mrs. Allen	I hope you have had a pleasant airing ? ” “
Mrs. Allen	, ma’am , I thank you ; we could not have had a nicer day . ” “
Mrs. Allen	have seen Mrs. Thorpe , then ? ” “
Mrs. Allen	I wish you could dance , my dear — I wish you could get a partner . ”
Mrs. Allen	It would have been very shocking to have it torn , ”
Mrs. Allen	would not it ? It is such a delicate muslin . For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room , I assure you . ”
Mrs. Allen	Yes , my dear , ”
Mrs. Allen	it is very uncomfortable indeed . ”
Mrs. Allen	Well , Miss Morland , ”
Mrs. Allen	I hope you have had an agreeable ball . ”
Mrs. Allen	We shall do better another evening I hope , ”
Mrs. Allen	commonly take so little notice of those things , ” said
Mrs. Allen	can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another . You must be a great comfort to your sister , sir . ” “
Mrs. Allen	hope I am , madam . ” “
Mrs. Allen	can you , ” said
Mrs. Allen	so — ” She
Mrs. Allen	am quite of your opinion , sir , ” replied
Mrs. Allen	so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . ” “
Mrs. Allen	This is my favourite place , ”
Mrs. Allen	it is so out of the way . ”
Mrs. Allen	My dear , you tumble my gown , ”
Mrs. Allen	But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk ; I never thought of such a thing ; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop ; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you ; now , Mrs. Allen , did not — Oh ! you were not there ; but indeed I did ; and , if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped , I would have jumped out and run after you . ”
Mrs. Allen	madam , ” cried
Mrs. Allen	so I should , my dear , you may depend on it ; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting , I would always do the best for you in my power . But one must not be over particular . Young people _ will _ be young people , as your good mother says herself . You know I wanted you , when we first came , not to buy that sprigged muslin , but you would . Young people do not like to be always thwarted . ” “
James Morland	had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on to - day ; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street , very little more than seven miles ; and , I suppose , we have at least eight more to go . It will never do . We set out a great deal too late . We had much better put it off till another day , and turn round . ” “
James Morland	I am sure he could not afford it . ” “
James Morland	why can not he afford it ? ” “
James Morland	he has not money enough . ” “
James Morland	whose fault is that ? ” “
James Morland	’s , that I know of . ” Thorpe
James Morland	Good - bye , my dear love , ”
James Morland	Upon my honour , ”
James Morland	in these public assemblies , it is as often done as not . ”
James Morland	Nonsense , how can you say so ? But when you men have a point to carry , you never stick at anything . My sweet Catherine , do support me ; persuade your brother how impossible it is . Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing ; now would not it ? ”
James Morland	a sweet girl she is ! i quite dote on her . ” “
James Morland	you see anybody else of our acquaintance ? ” “
James Morland	; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent , and there we met Mrs. Hughes , and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her . ” “
James Morland	you indeed ? And did they speak to you ? ” “
James Morland	, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour . They seem very agreeable people . Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin , and I fancy , by what I can learn , that she always dresses very handsomely . Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family . ” “
Mrs. Thorpe	Here come my dear girls , ”
Mrs. Thorpe	The very picture of him indeed ! ”
Mrs. Thorpe	I should have known her anywhere for his sister ! ”
Mrs. Thorpe	glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! ” and
Mr. Allen	am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . It was a strange , wild scheme . ” They
Mr. Allen	Allen is as rich as a Jew — is not he ? ” Catherine
Mr. Allen	Allen , the man you are with . ” “
Mr. Allen	! mr . Allen , you mean . Yes , I believe , he is very rich . ” “
Mr. Allen	, indeed , ” was
Mr. Allen	Allen ’s dining - parlour was not more than half as large , ” and
Mrs. Morland	My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , ”
Mrs. Morland	depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . ”
Mrs. Morland	I am sorry for the young people , ”
Mrs. Morland	they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General Tilney . ”
Mrs. Morland	Well , ”
Mrs. Morland	I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done . It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets . ”
Mrs. Morland	This has been a strange acquaintance , ”
Mrs. Morland	soon made and soon ended . I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella . Ah ! poor James ! well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . ”
Mrs. Morland	but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ; for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with , and who was so entirely without fortune ; and now , after such behaviour , we can not think at all well of her . Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice . ”
Mrs. Morland	Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , ”
Mrs. Morland	My dear Catherine , I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady . I do not know when poor Richard ’s cravats would be done , if he had no friend but you . Your head runs too much upon Bath ; but there is a time for everything — a time for balls and plays , and a time for work . You have had a long run of amusement , and now you must try to be useful . ”
Mrs. Morland	Mr. Henry Tilney , ”
Mrs. Morland	, ” continued
