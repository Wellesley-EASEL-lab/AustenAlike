Emma Woodhouse	"I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed . I know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We are quite well.-- This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , I think every body feels a north - east wind.-- I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by Mr. Perry , that it had not made him ill .

Emma Woodhouse	"The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton . There was intimacy between them , and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton since his going away . Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet 's being obliged to say a word . This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties . She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .

Emma Woodhouse	"replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter.--""Oh ! here it is . I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table . I was reading it to Mrs. Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her-- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;--but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see-- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half . My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well . She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work'-- do n't you , ma'am?--And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her-- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . And , indeed , though my mother 's eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God ! with the help of spectacles . It is such a blessing ! My mother 's are really very good indeed . Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me as well . ' """
Emma Woodhouse	"do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane 's handwriting ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh yes ; next week . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Thank you . You are very kind . Yes , next week . Every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things . I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her . Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she can not say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days . So very good of them to send her the whole way ! But they always do , you know . Oh yes , Friday or Saturday next . That is what she writes about . That is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , so I imagined . I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to - day . """
Emma Woodhouse	"So obliging of you ! No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at least . Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland . Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane 's letter -- wrote in Mr. Dixon 's name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy . Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr. Dixon , I mean-- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter 's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself . He is a most amiable , charming young man , I believe . Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things . """
Emma Woodhouse	Very true , very true , indeed . The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of ; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us , for months together -- not able to come if any thing was to happen . But you see , every thing turns out for the best . They want her ( Mr. and Mrs. Dixon ) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _ joint _ invitation , Jane says , as you will hear presently ; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention . He is a most charming young man . Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit-- ( I can never think of it without trembling!) --But ever since we had the history of that day , I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon !
Emma Woodhouse	""" But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _ wish _ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am concerned to hear of it . I think they judge wisely . But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed . Mrs. Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no . You are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not . There is no comparison between them . Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , that of course ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Jane caught a bad cold , poor thing ! so long ago as the 7th of November , ( as I am going to read to you , ) and has never been well since . A long time , is not it , for a cold to hang upon her ? She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us . Just like her ! so considerate!--But however , she is so far from well , that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home , and try an air that always agrees with her ; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her-- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here , than go to Ireland , if she is unwell . Nobody could nurse her , as we should do ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday , and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following-- as you will find from Jane 's letter . So sudden!--You may guess , dear Miss Woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in ! If it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly . I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that . I always make a point of reading Jane 's letters through to myself first , before I read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her . Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me ! poor Jane is ill!' -- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at . However , when I read on , I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first ; and I make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it . But I can not imagine how I could be so off my guard . If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr. Perry . The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time . Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her"
Emma Woodhouse	". "" And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded . She regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax 's letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself"
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life . "" It was , indeed , a highly prized letter . Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome"
Emma Woodhouse	to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate
Emma Woodhouse	might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at
Emma Woodhouse	she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma 's losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour 's
Emma Woodhouse	, from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to
Emma Woodhouse	situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations
Emma Woodhouse	And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston 's disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father ,
Emma Woodhouse	"sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own . But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse 's giving a gentle sigh , and saying , "" Ah , poor Miss Taylor ! She would be very glad to stay . "" There was no recovering Miss Taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse . The compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up . His own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself ."
Emma Woodhouse	large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit
Emma Woodhouse	on his own terms . Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr. Knightley , comprehended many such . Not unfrequently , through Emma 's
Emma Woodhouse	Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ;
Emma Woodhouse	by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse 's drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away . After these came a second
Emma Woodhouse	no hardship for either James or the horses . Had it taken place
Emma Woodhouse	Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite . Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich

Emma Woodhouse	""" replied Mrs. Weston , smiling ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before--""You must know , my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper . To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth . Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" He ought to come ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes ."
Emma Woodhouse	"This is too bad , """
Emma Woodhouse	"Well , well , I am ready;""--and turning again to Emma , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" I think you will to - day . You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue ."
Emma Woodhouse	"We had better move on , Mr. Weston , """
Emma Woodhouse	"we are detaining the girls . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	""" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ? Oh ! yes , perfectly.-- Why do you make a doubt of it ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Never , never !"

Emma Woodhouse	"_ two _ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard 's drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of Mrs. Martin 's saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _ her _ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea:--a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Well done , Mrs. Martin ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"You know what you are about . """
Emma Woodhouse	"And when she had come away , Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen . Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ? He does not read ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh yes!--that is , no -- I do not know -- but I believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of . He reads the Agricultural Reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _ them _ to himself . But sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts , very entertaining . And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield . He never read the Romance of the Forest , nor The Children of the Abbey . He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can . """
Emma Woodhouse	"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! not handsome -- not at all handsome . I thought him very plain at first , but I do not think him so plain now . One does not , you know , after a time . But did you never see him ? He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston . He has passed you very often . """
Emma Woodhouse	"That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name . A young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity . The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do . A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other . But a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it . """
Emma Woodhouse	"To be sure . Oh yes ! It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man . I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well . What do you imagine his age to be ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day 's difference -- which is very odd . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Only four - and - twenty . That is too young to settle . His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry . They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it . Six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Six years hence ! Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"Well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence . Mr. Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world . Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet . """
Emma Woodhouse	"To be sure , so it is . But they live very comfortably . They have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry;--I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice . The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates . There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman 's daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you . """
Emma Woodhouse	"This is coming as you should do , """
Emma Woodhouse	"like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you . """
Emma Woodhouse	"How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes I should , I am sure I should . There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them . You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances . _ Now _ you have nothing to try for . You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . You are not striving to look taller than any body else . _ Now _ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought-- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Nay , why do you ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell 's being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Very . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I rather wonder that it was never made before . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument-- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body . """
Emma Woodhouse	"That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates 's house . """
Emma Woodhouse	"You may _ say _ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _ thoughts _ on this subject are very much like mine . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I do not know . I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve . I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question . If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mrs. Dixon ! very true indeed . I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon . She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman 's scheme than an elderly man 's . It is Mrs. Dixon , I dare say . I told you that your suspicions would guide mine . """
Emma Woodhouse	"If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _ Mr _ . Dixon in them . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Dixon.--Very well . Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _ her _ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland . Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body 's native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her 's . I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are . """
Emma Woodhouse	"And , upon my word , they have an air of great probability . Mr. Dixon 's preference of her music to her friend 's , I can answer for being very decided . """
Emma Woodhouse	"And then , he saved her life . Did you ever hear of that?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard . He caught her . """
Emma Woodhouse	"He did . I was there -- one of the party . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.--It was the work of a moment . And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again-- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable . I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries . """
Emma Woodhouse	"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells . """
Emma Woodhouse	"No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells . Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first . She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them . I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . """
Emma Woodhouse	"He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut . """
Emma Woodhouse	"What is the matter ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Thank you for rousing me , """
Emma Woodhouse	"I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I can not keep my eyes from her . I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own . I see nobody else looking like her!-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion . Shall I?-- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it;-- whether she colours . """

Emma Woodhouse	""" said Emma--""nothing more likely . I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax 's ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley . I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax !"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him . I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment-- I believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax ."

Emma Woodhouse	"but I do not know ; they _ tell _ me she is well . I dare say my daughter will be here presently , Miss Woodhouse . I hope you find a chair . I wish Hetty had not gone . I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma'am ? Do you sit where you like ? I am sure she will be here presently . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Ah ! Miss Woodhouse , how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard-- and are come to give us joy . This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning:-- such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs. Dixon . ` My dear , ' said I , ` you will blind yourself'-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually . One can not wonder , one can not wonder . It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing her tears)--but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has . When one is in great pain , you know one can not feel any blessing quite as it may deserve . She is as low as possible . To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room-- I want her to lie down upon the bed . ` My dear , ' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed : ' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room . But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well . She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her . You were kept waiting at the door -- I was quite ashamed-- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming . ` It is only Mrs. Cole , ' said I , ` depend upon it . Nobody else would come so early . ' ` Well , ' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now . ' But then Patty came in , and said it was you . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her . '-- ` I can see nobody , ' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were . ` If you must go , my dear , ' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed . ' """
Emma Woodhouse	"It must be a severe trial to them all . She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell 's return . """
Emma Woodhouse	"So very kind ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"But you are always kind . """
Emma Woodhouse	"always ; """
Emma Woodhouse	"Where -- may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"To a Mrs. Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children . Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs. Suckling 's own family , and Mrs. Bragge 's ; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove . Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mrs. Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes-- """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , our good Mrs. Elton . The most indefatigable , true friend . She would not take a denial . She would not let Jane say , ` No ; ' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell , ) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell 's return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did . It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane 's answer ; but she positively declared she would _ not _ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go . Quite a surprize to me ! I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge 's situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it till it was all settled . """
Emma Woodhouse	"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , all of us ; Mrs. Elton would have us come . It was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley . ` You _ must _ _ all _ spend your evening with us , ' said she--`I positively must have you _ all _ come . ' """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Knightley was there too , was he ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"No , not Mr. Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not;--but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had . Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning 's party . Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I can not say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it . However , _ I _ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"I dare say she had . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- I mean , as to the character and manners of the family . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse . Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it . Except the Sucklings and Bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all Mrs. Elton 's acquaintance . Mrs. Smallridge , a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove -- and as to the children , except the little Sucklings and little Bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere . Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!-- It will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure.--And her salary!-- I really can not venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse . Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Ah ! madam , """
Emma Woodhouse	"if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned . """
Emma Woodhouse	"You are so noble in your ideas ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Very soon , very soon , indeed ; that 's the worst of it . Within a fortnight . Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry . My poor mother does not know how to bear it . So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma'am , do not let us think about it any more . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she can not feel herself justified in declining . I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton , and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it ! It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh ! no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that . Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy 's son wanted to speak with him . Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints-- I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , if she gets out at all . And poor John 's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr. Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond . That was what happened before tea . It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton . """
Emma Woodhouse	"There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment , """
Emma Woodhouse	"that I can not have a doubt as to Mr. Elton 's intentions . You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it . I thought it must be so . I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you . Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened . I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural . Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other ! I am very happy . I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart . This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . This is a connexion which offers nothing but good . It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us . """

Emma Woodhouse	"He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors .

They walked together . He was silent . She thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give . And this belief produced another dread . Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject . He must do it all himself . Yet she could not bear this silence . With him it was most unnatural . She considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began--"

Emma Woodhouse	", "" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion .

Many circumstances assisted the temptation . He was the son of Mr. Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions . Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed-- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side . He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me . I have never been attached to him . And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . He never wished to attach me . It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was _ not _ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from"

Emma Woodhouse	"most prominent feeling . "" I can not make"
Emma Woodhouse	"hear your voice . "" While he spoke , Emma 's mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word-- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet 's hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet 's secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two-- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not . She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain . She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading . Her way was clear , though not quite smooth.--She spoke then , on being so entreated.-- What did she say?--Just what she ought , of course . A lady always does.-- She said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself . He _ had _ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation . Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material.-- Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his . He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence . He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it . He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill 's engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings . The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his!--Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name . _ Her _ change was equal.--This one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust.--On his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other . It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away . He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.-- But he had gone to a wrong place . There was too much domestic happiness in his brother 's house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning 's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery . He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him . Frank Churchill 's character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good"

Emma Woodhouse	"Ah ! you will never guess . You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em - ma.--Do you understand ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; """
Emma Woodhouse	"Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off . """
Emma Woodhouse	"said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing:--""How well they suit one another!--Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath ! Peculiarly lucky!-- for as to any real knowledge of a person 's disposition that Bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge . It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . Short of that , it is all guess and luck-- and will generally be ill - luck . How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"Such things do occur , undoubtedly . ""--She was stopped by a cough . Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen . """
Emma Woodhouse	"said he , gravely . She recovered her voice . """

Emma Woodhouse	"Emma was in no danger of forgetting . It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling . Would not Harriet be the very creature described ? Hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it .

Emma Woodhouse	While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in . He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless . They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern . She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late . He had turned away , and the horses were in motion . She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind . She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal . Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life . She was most forcibly struck . The truth of this representation there was no denying . She felt it at her heart . How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates ! How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued ! And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness ! Time did not compose her . As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more . She never had been so depressed . Happily it was not necessary to speak . There was only Harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were .

Emma Woodhouse	"What an excellent device , """
Emma Woodhouse	"the use of a sheepskin for carriages . How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold with such precautions .

One is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted . Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence . It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha ! snows a little I see . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day 's party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence . This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings . At Christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather . I was snowed up at a friend 's house once for a week . Nothing could be pleasanter . I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se'nnight . """

Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! dear , no , never . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr. Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do . Harriet 's features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success . Pray , pray attempt it . As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession . """
Emma Woodhouse	"But I am afraid , Mr. Elton , Harriet will not like to sit . She thinks so little of her own beauty . Did not you observe her manner of answering me ? How completely it meant , ` why should my picture be drawn ? ' """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! yes , I observed it , I assure you . It was not lost on me . But still I can not imagine she would not be persuaded . """
Emma Woodhouse	"No great variety of faces for you , """
Emma Woodhouse	"I had only my own family to study from . There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore . Mrs. Weston again , and again , and again , you see . Dear Mrs. Weston ! always my kindest friend on every occasion . She would sit whenever I asked her . There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike . I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . Then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children;--there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama 's children ever were . Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby . I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see . He had nestled down his head most conveniently . That 's very like . I am rather proud of little George . The corner of the sofa is very good . Then here is my last,""--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length--""my last and my best -- my brother , Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished , when I put it away in a pet , and vowed I would never take another likeness . I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs . Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _ very _ like)--only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella 's cold approbation of--""Yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , """
Emma Woodhouse	"with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once . But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer . She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait . It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr. John Knightley 's , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist . But there was no doing any thing , with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch . She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere . It then occurred to her to employ him in reading . """
Emma Woodhouse	"The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy . Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism . """

Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!-- Jane , Jane , look!--did you ever see any thing ? Oh ! Mr. Weston , you must really have had Aladdin 's lamp . Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again . I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ` Oh ! Mrs. Stokes , ' said I-- but I had not time for more . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Very well , I thank you , ma'am . I hope you are quite well . Very happy to hear it . So afraid you might have a headache!-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . Delighted to hear it indeed .

Most comfortable carriage.-- Oh ! and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs. Weston , on that score . Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been.-- But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours . I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma'am-- . ' Thank you , my mother is remarkably well . Gone to Mr. Woodhouse 's . I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon 's wedding - present.--So kind of her to think of my mother ! Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr. Dixon 's choice . There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time . Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive . My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh ! Mr. Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother 's spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again . My mother often talks of your good - nature . Does not she , Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- Ah ! here 's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do?-- Very well I thank you , quite well . This is meeting quite in fairy - land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane 's hair?--You are a judge.-- She did it all herself . Quite wonderful how she does her hair!-- No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah ! Dr. Hughes I declare-- and Mrs. Hughes . Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How do you do ? How do you do?--Very well , I thank you . This is delightful , is not it?--Where 's dear Mr. Richard?-- Oh ! there he is . Do n't disturb him . Much better employed talking to the young ladies . How do you do , Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs. Otway , I protest!-- and good Mr. Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do ? How do you all do?--Quite well , I am much obliged to you . Never better.-- Do n't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends ! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted . No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee.--A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,--no hurry -- Oh ! here it comes . Every thing so good ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- How has Wright done my hair?"" --with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness . Mrs. Elton then said ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously , that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , and did not want to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while , till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton 's tones again distinctly forward.--Mr . Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" How do you like Mrs. Elton"
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" You are ungrateful"
Emma Woodhouse	"? "" said Mr. Weston"
Emma Woodhouse	". "" Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _ him _ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way , Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . It was almost enough to make her think of marrying . Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change . Mr. Weston might be his son 's superior.-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body 's eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid . There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner . They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable . The ball proceeded pleasantly . The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston , were not thrown away . Every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this . Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . There was one , however , which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma 's wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about . He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room . Escape , however , was not his plan . He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it . He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her.-- Emma saw it . She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all . When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr. Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind - hearted , gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say"
Emma Woodhouse	"? "" to which his prompt reply was"
Emma Woodhouse	.
Emma Woodhouse	". "" Mrs. Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat . This was Mr. Elton ! the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr. Elton.-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife . She would not look again . Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot . In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again . His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced . It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles . Mr. Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish . She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her;--_she _ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner"
Emma Woodhouse	". "" Supper was announced . The move began ; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon"
Emma Woodhouse	". "" Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked . He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton 's conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs. Elton 's looks also received the due share of censure"
Emma Woodhouse	"? "" He looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added"
Emma Woodhouse	", "" replied Emma"
Emma Woodhouse	". "" He shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said"
Emma Woodhouse	.

Emma Woodhouse	.
Emma Woodhouse	"No , no , """
Emma Woodhouse	"you are quite unreasonable . It would be dreadful to be standing so close ! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in a little room ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited-- """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . There is no hurry at all . If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . They will be so near their own stable . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . They will read together . She means it , I know . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old . I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now . But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma . She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not . """

Emma Woodhouse	"Do n't class us together , Harriet . My playing is no more like her 's , than a lamp is like sunshine . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! dear -- I think you play the best of the two . I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax 's is much beyond it . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Ah ! but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Are you sure ? I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste . Nobody talked about it . And I hate Italian singing.-- There is no understanding a word of it . Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . How did you think the Coxes looked ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox . I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer . """
Emma Woodhouse	"She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be . """
Emma Woodhouse	"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . He sat by her at dinner . Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Very likely.--I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I thought you meant to go with me . They would be very much pleased . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Me ! I should be quite in the way . But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here . Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . What am I to do ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"I am here on no business of my own , """
Emma Woodhouse	"I am only waiting for my friend . She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home . But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Well -- if you advise it.--But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall I say ? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston . She might do very well by herself . A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood . """

Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny . This was Colonel Campbell , who had
Emma Woodhouse	indebted
Emma Woodhouse	his power . When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her . He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane 's age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ;
Emma Woodhouse	his daughter 's great
Emma Woodhouse	. It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell 's family , and had lived with
Emma Woodhouse	supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . Such was Jane Fairfax
Emma Woodhouse	history . She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education . Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell 's residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters . Her
Emma Woodhouse	and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ;
Emma Woodhouse	particular
Emma Woodhouse	both
Emma Woodhouse	at
Emma Woodhouse	of
Emma Woodhouse	only
Emma Woodhouse	always
Emma Woodhouse	"to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . "" These were her reasons-- she had no better . It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance . Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very"
Emma Woodhouse	beauty
Emma Woodhouse	she had remembered ;
Emma Woodhouse	.
Emma Woodhouse	had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller
Emma Woodhouse	, of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her
Emma Woodhouse	whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury . There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit . In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with
Emma Woodhouse	and respect ; especially , if
Emma Woodhouse	her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on . Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon 's actions from his wife , or of
Emma Woodhouse	love , it might
Emma Woodhouse	"visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty . Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her . These were charming feelings -- but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , "" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! "" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . Former provocations reappeared . The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again . They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance . She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious ! There was no getting at her real opinion . Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing . She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved . If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing . She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon 's character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match . It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished . It did her no service however . Her caution was thrown away . Emma saw its artifice , and returned"
Emma Woodhouse	conceal than her own preference ;
Emma Woodhouse	"pounds . The like reserve prevailed on other topics . She and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time . It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was . "" Was he handsome?"" --""She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man . "" "" Was he agreeable?"" -- "" He was generally thought so . "" "" Did he appear a sensible young man ; a young man of information?"" --""At a watering"
Emma Woodhouse	nobody half so attentive
Emma Woodhouse	"last night -- if it had been handed round once , I think it would have been enough . "" "" No , "" said Mr. Knightley , nearly at the same time ; "" you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner"
Emma Woodhouse	"Nothing at all . But is not this a sudden scheme ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Well , my dear , and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming . Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates , Mr. Knightley , as I told you before . She is always so attentive to them ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled . Mrs. Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be . I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of . It ought to be a first object , as I am sure poor Miss Taylor 's always was with me . You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us . And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma 's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour . As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can . I treat you without ceremony , Mr. Knightley . We invalids think we are privileged people . """
Emma Woodhouse	"My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter . Emma will be happy to entertain you . And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk . """
Emma Woodhouse	"He is very obliging , """
Emma Woodhouse	"but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Pray , Mr. Knightley , """
Emma Woodhouse	"how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage . A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Nonsense ! a man does not imagine any such thing . But what is the meaning of this ? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ? madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken . """
Emma Woodhouse	"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet . Harriet 's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma laughed and disclaimed . He continued , """
Emma Woodhouse	"Good or bad ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"I do not know which it ought to be called . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance . You are trying not to smile . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Indeed ! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too . """
Emma Woodhouse	"There is one subject , """
Emma Woodhouse	"I hope but one , on which we do not think alike . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Does nothing occur to you?-- Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Have you heard from her yourself this morning ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"You have , I believe , and know the whole . """
Emma Woodhouse	"No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me . """
Emma Woodhouse	"You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin . """
Emma Woodhouse	"No , this is impossible ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"You mistake me , you quite mistake me , """
Emma Woodhouse	"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I can not believe it . It seems an impossibility!--You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin . You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet . You only mean , that he intends it . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I mean that he has done it , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me . How , where , when?--Let me know it all . I never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , I assure you.--How -- how has it been possible ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is a very simple story . He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley 's . They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley 's . The party was to be our brother and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith . My friend Robert could not resist . They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving . He came down by yesterday 's coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own . This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when . Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman 's language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only in the great.--However , I must say , that Robert Martin 's heart seemed for _ him _ , and to _ me _ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley 's , my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?--It was not Harriet 's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of?-- What do you deserve ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer . Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am perfectly satisfied ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" and most sincerely wish them happy ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet 's good qualities . I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin 's sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever , ) to get acquainted with her . I have often talked to her a good deal . You must have seen that I did . Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Me !"

Emma Woodhouse	""" He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness ."

Emma Woodhouse	""" The others had been talking of the child , Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant 's appearing not quite well . She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry . Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again . This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it ."

Emma Woodhouse	"she was energetic . This was one of her expressions . ` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Poor girl ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Wrong ! No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ` The consequence , ' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . Pain is no expiation . I never can be blameless . I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be . ' ` Do not imagine , madam , ' she continued , ` that I was taught wrong . Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell . ' """

Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I am afraid , """
Emma Woodhouse	"that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy . """
Emma Woodhouse	"On your side , my love , it was very innocently done . But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , """
Emma Woodhouse	"was that of making her _ unreasonable _ . The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been-- that had been -- hard for him to bear . ` I did not make the allowances , ' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits-- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ' She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . """
Emma Woodhouse	"If I did not know her to be happy now , """
Emma Woodhouse	"which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks;--for , oh ! Mrs. Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten . You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . They shew her to the greatest advantage . I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . """

And I think she feels it . I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent . One can see that she feels the want of encouragement . I like her the better for it . I must confess it is a recommendation to me . I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . Oh ! I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . """

Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a"
Emma Woodhouse	""" The change on Mrs. Elton 's side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton , nor , under Mrs. Elton 's guidance , the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done . She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates 's gratitude for Mrs. Elton 's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth . She was quite one of her worthies-- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered . Emma 's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do . She heard of her walking with the Eltons , sitting with the Eltons , spending a day with the Eltons ! This was astonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself . There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere.-- She is _ not _ to be with the _ Dixons _ . The decree is issued by somebody . But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" We can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home .

Emma Woodhouse	""" Such attentions as Mrs. Elton 's , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax . Mrs. Elton 's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I should not wonder ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt 's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton 's civilities for her .

Emma Woodhouse	""" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . Do not beat me . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I do not know why you should say so . He wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I can not believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it . It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof . """
Emma Woodhouse	"How odd you are ! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too . If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January . A man at his age -- what is he?--three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that . It is impossible . """
Emma Woodhouse	"That 's easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master . You are the worst judge in the world , Mr. Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence . You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage . """
Emma Woodhouse	"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount . He can not want money -- he can not want leisure . We know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom . We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other . A little while ago , he was at Weymouth . This proves that he can leave the Churchills . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , sometimes he can . """
Emma Woodhouse	"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure . """
Emma Woodhouse	"It is very unfair to judge of any body 's conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation . Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be . We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs. Churchill 's temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do . He may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others . """
Emma Woodhouse	There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution . It is Frank Churchill 's duty to pay this attention to his father . He knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done . A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs. Churchill-- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately . I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion . I shall , therefore , set off to - morrow . ' -- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going .
Emma Woodhouse	""" No ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use!--Nobody but you , Mr. Knightley , would imagine it possible . But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" I rather doubt that . You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr. Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill 's situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect . The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through . To him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought . He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh , the difference of situation and habit ! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others . It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency . I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man . As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority . He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father . Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" We shall never agree about him ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" but that is nothing extraordinary . I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not . Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man 's perfection . I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it . He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father 's having any right to complain . His letters disgust me ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Your feelings are singular . They seem to satisfy every body else ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston . They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother 's place , but without a mother 's affection to blind her . It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission . Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no . Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ? No , Emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in French , not in English . He may be very ` aimable , ' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You seem determined to think ill of him ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at Highbury . We do not often look upon fine young men , well - bred and agreeable . We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain . Can not you imagine , Mr. Knightley , what a _ sensation _ his coming will produce ? There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury ; but one interest-- one object of curiosity ; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable . To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I will say no more about him ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" you turn every thing to evil . We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Prejudiced ! I am not prejudiced ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" But I am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it . My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour ."
Emma Woodhouse	"You had better order the carriage directly , my love , """
Emma Woodhouse	"I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk . I am not at all afraid . I should not mind walking half the way . I could change my shoes , you know , the moment I got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold . Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home , I dare say . It will be bad enough for the horses . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I am ready , if the others are . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Shall I ring the bell ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , do . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I am very much astonished , Mr. Elton . This to _ me _ ! you forget yourself-- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _ me _ , if you please . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!"" -- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	""" cried Mr. Elton ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" It would be impossible to say what Emma felt , on hearing this-- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost . She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton 's sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed--"
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , """
Emma Woodhouse	"I hope I do . """
Emma Woodhouse	"How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . . """
Emma Woodhouse	"It seems like madness ! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him-- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night!--However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil.--No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment 's pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept-- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke).--However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown . Can not you guess what this parcel holds ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"My dearest Harriet ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear . Remember it ? Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!--Oh ! my sins , my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)-- go on -- what else ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally . """
Emma Woodhouse	"And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"Lord bless me ! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about ! I never was equal to this . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And when ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so""--and thought no more of it , till after a minute 's silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment 's debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied ,"
Emma Woodhouse	there was an air of
Emma Woodhouse	"approve . It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges . His father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that """
Emma Woodhouse	"Then turning to Mrs. Weston , with a look of gentle reproach--""Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . """
Emma Woodhouse	"You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _ compliments _ , of course . But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done . We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him . We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely . And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over . """
Emma Woodhouse	"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . There will be a great many people talking at once . You will not like the noise . """
Emma Woodhouse	"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles . Emma 's going away directly after tea might be giving offence . They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body 's hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse 's doing it would be more thought of than any other person 's in the room . You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years . """
Emma Woodhouse	"No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me . I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . I know what worthy people they are . Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr. Cole is very bilious . No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , we must consider this . I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . You will not regard being tired . You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh yes , papa . I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account . I am only afraid of your sitting up for me . I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard . She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must promise me not to sit up . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Harriet , poor Harriet!"" --Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _ his _ behaviour as her _ own _ , which made her so angry with him . It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet 's account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery . Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said ,"
Emma Woodhouse	", "" she added"
Emma Woodhouse	". "" She was extremely angry with herself . If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . This discovery laid many smaller matters open . No doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane 's eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed . An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison . She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge ! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet 's mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston 's parting words"
Emma Woodhouse	"? "" "" What news do you"
Emma Woodhouse	". "" "" What did Mr. Weston tell you?"" --said Emma ,"
Emma Woodhouse	"very odd ! "" It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet 's behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it . Her character appeared absolutely changed . She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery . Emma looked at her , quite unable"
Emma Woodhouse	"any idea , """
Emma Woodhouse	but
Emma Woodhouse	"my word , """
Emma Woodhouse	you
Emma Woodhouse	""" Me ! "" cried Harriet , colouring ,"
Emma Woodhouse	about
Emma Woodhouse	""" Harriet ! "" cried Emma , after a moment 's pause--""What do you mean?-- Good Heaven ! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I"
Emma Woodhouse	upon
Emma Woodhouse	"Good God ! """
Emma Woodhouse	be
Emma Woodhouse	"Pray do . I 'd rather you would . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Well , well , """
Emma Woodhouse	"Is it a good letter ? or is it too short ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , indeed , a very good letter , """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh no , no ! the letter had much better be all your own . You will express yourself very properly , I am sure . There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing . Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _ your _ mind , I am persuaded . You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment . """
Emma Woodhouse	"You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect . """
Emma Woodhouse	"No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean -- What shall I do ? What would you advise me to do ? Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _ doubts _ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . If she can hesitate as to ` Yes , ' she ought to say ` No ' directly . It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you . But do not imagine that I want to influence you . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! no , I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that -- As you say , one 's mind ought to be quite made up -- One should not be hesitating -- It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say ` No , ' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say ` No ? ' """
Emma Woodhouse	"Not for the world , """
Emma Woodhouse	"would I advise you either way . You must be the best judge of your own happiness . If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ? You blush , Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ? Harriet , Harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion . At this moment whom are you thinking of ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr. Martin . Do you think I am right ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest Harriet ; you are doing just what you ought . While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving . Dear Harriet , I give myself joy of this . It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin . While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me . I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin , of Abbey - Mill Farm . Now I am secure of you for ever . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Dear affectionate creature!--_You _ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm!--_You _ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life ! I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it . He must have a pretty good opinion of himself . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too . """
Emma Woodhouse	"very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Oh ! yes , very . Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions . I am quite determined to refuse him . But how shall I do ? What shall I say ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again , """
Emma Woodhouse	"Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet . You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey - Mill . """
Emma Woodhouse	"And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened . I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper . """
Emma Woodhouse	"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet . I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married . Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes . As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark . The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of Highbury yet . Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . I hope he will not mind it so very much . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed , """
Emma Woodhouse	"At this moment , perhaps , Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name . """
Emma Woodhouse	"My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond - street . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton . No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow . It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight . It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession . How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"It is not fair , """
Emma Woodhouse	"mine was a random guess . Do not distress her . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I see how it is , """
Emma Woodhouse	"I see what a life I am to lead among you . Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . We really seem quite the fashion . If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss . """
Emma Woodhouse	"She would rather not be in his company more than she could help . She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home . """
Emma Woodhouse	"That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before . The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives . When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Indifferent ! Oh ! no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent . Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Ah ! you are not serious now . I know Mr. John Knightley too well-- I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day . """
Emma Woodhouse	"My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well . They are some of my very old friends . I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure . My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . """
Emma Woodhouse	"My dear Jane , what is this I hear?--Going to the post - office in the rain!--This must not be , I assure you.--You sad girl , how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you . """

Emma Woodhouse	""" He writes like a sensible man ,"

It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already .

Emma Woodhouse	""" My Emma , he means no such thing . He only means--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two ,"
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	""" The time was coming when the news must spread farther , and other persons ' reception of it tried . As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse 's visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls.-- But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr. Knightley 's absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too . She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself . She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all-- she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person 's company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston , best in the world . Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it . She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do . Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes . That was all very true . Mr. Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could not they go on as they had done ? Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest.-- To Emma 's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley 's , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion.-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs. Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one-- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse 's mind.--It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other-- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . Mrs. Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband 's plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma . How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment -- less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying--""Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Was he handsome?"" --""She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Yes -- what should hurt me?--I walk fast . I shall be at home in twenty minutes"
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone . Let my father 's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage . It can be round in five minutes"
Emma Woodhouse	", "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone!"" --seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her"

Augusta Elton	"I get quite anxious about you . June will soon be here . """
Augusta Elton	"But I have never fixed on June or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general . """
Augusta Elton	"Oh ! my dear , we can not begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . """
Augusta Elton	"Something that would do ! """
Augusta Elton	"Aye , _ that _ may suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life . """
Augusta Elton	"You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison . A gentleman 's family is all that I should condition for . """
Augusta Elton	"I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is -- I do not know-- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play;--yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest .

Augusta Elton	"in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . """
Augusta Elton	""" Another thing must be taken into consideration too -- Mrs. Elton does not talk _ to _ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _ of _ her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other-- a something more early implanted . We can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton 's way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness ."
Augusta Elton	""" Yes ,"

Augusta Elton	"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home . """
Augusta Elton	"That 's quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:--but as you like . It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing . I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon . Nothing can be more simple , you see . And Jane will have such another . There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party . We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know . Every thing as natural and simple as possible . Is not that your idea ? """
Augusta Elton	"Not quite . My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors . When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house . """
Augusta Elton	"Well -- as you please ; only do n't have a great set out . And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley . If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything-- """
Augusta Elton	"I have not the least wish for it , I thank you . """
Augusta Elton	"Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . """
Augusta Elton	"I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body 's assistance . """
Augusta Elton	"I wish we had a donkey . The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by . I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;--and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . """
Augusta Elton	"You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury . Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . You can borrow Mrs. Cole 's . I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible . """
Augusta Elton	"That I am sure you would . Indeed I do you justice , my good friend . Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart . As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . """
Augusta Elton	"Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma 's , and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning . He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them-- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out . """
Augusta Elton	"Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy.-- She had some fears of his horse . Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question . Mrs. Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures . It was not with Mrs. Suckling , it was not with Mrs. Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove . Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend 's negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow 's post.--How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal.-- """

Jane Fairfax	""" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry . Miss Hawkins,--I dare say , an excellent young woman . His extreme attention to my mother-- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick . Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf . He fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath-- but she says it did him no lasting benefit . Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel . And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him . It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do .

Jane Fairfax	"dear Mrs. Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ? """
Jane Fairfax	"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have . You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _ first _ situations . I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove . A cousin of Mr. Suckling , Mrs. Bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle . Wax - candles in the schoolroom ! You may imagine how desirable ! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge 's is the one I would most wish to see you in . """
Jane Fairfax	"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer , """

Jane Fairfax	"Trouble ! aye , I know your scruples . You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am . I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible . """
Jane Fairfax	"Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble . """
Jane Fairfax	"But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . Your inexperience really amuses me ! A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment 's notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . """
Jane Fairfax	"Excuse me , ma'am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale-- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect . """
Jane Fairfax	"Oh ! my dear , human flesh ! You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . """
Jane Fairfax	"I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade , """
Jane Fairfax	"governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies . But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do . """
Jane Fairfax	"You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , """
Jane Fairfax	"they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs. Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am . """
Jane Fairfax	"Poor Mrs. Churchill ! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper . It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr. Churchill do without her ? Mr. Churchill 's loss would be dreadful indeed . Mr. Churchill would never get over it . "" -- Even Mr. Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said ,"
Jane Fairfax	""" and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady . How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was also a very early speculation with Emma . The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . She saw in a moment all the possible good . Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter . Mr. Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. Churchill 's death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma 's side . It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet 's opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it . The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message ."
Jane Fairfax	""" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge 's at the time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged-- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . Her spirits seemed overcome . Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:-- confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise-- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . The answer was only in this short note :"
Jane Fairfax	""" Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates 's , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her-- but it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried-- but all in vain . Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in ."
Jane Fairfax	""" Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note . In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but"
Jane Fairfax	""" When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together-- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _ her _ . She was sorry , very sorry . Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove ."
Jane Fairfax	""" said he , turning his eyes towards Jane ."
Jane Fairfax	""" But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing ."
Jane Fairfax	"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.-- And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . We must bring her forward . Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet , ` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air . ' We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax . """

Jane Fairfax	""" said she.--""To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort ! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton 's notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection ."
Jane Fairfax	""" Emma returned her friend 's pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim ,"
Jane Fairfax	""""
Jane Fairfax	""""
Jane Fairfax	""" said Mr. Knightley--""I do not accuse her of want of feeling . Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness . She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper . No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond ."
Jane Fairfax	and nothing suits me so well . I met her frequently at Weymouth . I had known the Campbells a little in town ; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set . Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs. Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman
Jane Fairfax	"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell , """
Jane Fairfax	"I can imagine nothing with any confidence . It must be all conjecture . """
Jane Fairfax	"Conjecture -- aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong . I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm . What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all;--your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing . There , it is done . I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present . """
Jane Fairfax	"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _ has _ made one happy!-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth . """
Jane Fairfax	"Yes , """
Jane Fairfax	"we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . """
Jane Fairfax	"Oh ! yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud . You must have heard every thing to be sure . ` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ? ' said he ; so I just mentioned . . . . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , must you be going?--You seem but just come -- so very obliging of you . """
Jane Fairfax	"This is very true , """
Jane Fairfax	"at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful.--Of the same age-- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend.-- She will never like me now . I have neglected her too long . But I will shew her greater attention than I have done . """
Jane Fairfax	"I went only to the post - office , """
Jane Fairfax	"and reached home before the rain was much . It is my daily errand . I always fetch the letters when I am here . It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out . A walk before breakfast does me good . """
Jane Fairfax	"Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . """
Jane Fairfax	"No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out . """
Jane Fairfax	"You are extremely kind , """
Jane Fairfax	"but I can not give up my early walk . I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . """
Jane Fairfax	"Excuse me , """
Jane Fairfax	"I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama 's . """
Jane Fairfax	"The post - office is a wonderful establishment ! """
Jane Fairfax	"The regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing ! """
Jane Fairfax	"It is certainly very well regulated . """
Jane Fairfax	"She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! """

Jane Fairfax	"said he , """
Miss Bates	"You are extremely kind , """

Miss Bates	ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr. Woodhouse thought
Miss Bates	a grievance . Mrs. Bates , the widow of a former vicar
Miss Bates	and the endeavour to make a small income
Miss Bates	. And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will . It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders . She loved
Miss Bates	body , was
Miss Bates	to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new
Miss Bates	of health and into vanity
Miss Bates	style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . Encouragement should be given . Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions . The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her . The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm . They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the
Miss Bates	of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _ She _ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions
Miss Bates	she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests . Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare . He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to
Miss Bates	thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat
Miss Bates	"Why , to own the truth , """
Miss Bates	"if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to-- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls . Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware . I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not . I am not like Jane ; I wish I were . I will answer for it _ she _ never betrayed the least thing in the world . Where is she?--Oh ! just behind . Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry 's coming.-- Extraordinary dream , indeed ! """
Miss Bates	"Beg her to walk up;""--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging . There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , """
Miss Bates	"No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls , """
Miss Bates	"Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse-- I come quite over - powered . Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to be married . """
Miss Bates	"But where could _ you _ hear it ? """
Miss Bates	""" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse !"
Miss Bates	""" my mother is so pleased!--she says she can not bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress . This is great news , indeed . Jane , you have never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him ."
Miss Bates	""" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse ,"
Miss Bates	""" four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs. Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man -- but'--In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . I do not pretend to it . What is before me , I see . At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly . She knows I would not offend for the world . How does Miss Smith do ? She seems quite recovered now . Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ? Oh ! those dear little children . Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley . I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative ."
Miss Bates	""" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all ."

George Knightley	"Nay , I had it from you . You wrote me word of it three months ago . """
George Knightley	"Me ! impossible ! """
George Knightley	"Indeed you did . I remember it perfectly . You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . Mrs. Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . It was owing to _ her _ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . You must remember it now ? """
George Knightley	"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment . """
George Knightley	"Never ! really , never!--Bless me ! how could it be?--Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was completely persuaded -- Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired . You will not be sorry to find yourself at home . """
George Knightley	"No , sir , """
George Knightley	"I seem to have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston 's having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream . I am a great dreamer . I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away-- and when I have gone through my particular friends , then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry . """
George Knightley	"Nonsense ! for shame ! """
George Knightley	""" Pray , Emma ,"
George Knightley	""" may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ? I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other ."

George Knightley	""" seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill ."
George Knightley	""" My dear Emma ,"
George Knightley	""" do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ?"
George Knightley	"I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it . Mr. Knightley , he is _ not _ a trifling , silly young man . If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.--No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . """
George Knightley	"Nonsensical girl ! """
George Knightley	"One can suppose nothing else , """
George Knightley	"and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt . But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . They might chuse to surprize her . """
George Knightley	"I have made a most wretched discovery , """
George Knightley	"I have been here a week to - morrow -- half my time . I never knew days fly so fast . A week to - morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston , and others!-- I hate the recollection . """
George Knightley	"No , """
George Knightley	"that is no subject of regret at all . I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . """
George Knightley	""" Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?--Mr . Knightley!--Mr .

I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley 's marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely . I am amazed that you should think of such a thing ."
George Knightley	""" My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry-- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry 's account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ?"
George Knightley	""" Yes , I would . I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- Mr. Knightley marry!--No , I have never had such an idea , and I can not adopt it now . And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !"
George Knightley	""" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know ."
George Knightley	""" But the imprudence of such a match !"
George Knightley	""" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."
George Knightley	""" I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax-- and is always glad to shew them attention . My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making . You do it very ill . Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh ! no , no;--every feeling revolts . For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing ."
George Knightley	""" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable ."
George Knightley	""" But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry . I am sure he has not the least idea of it . Do not put it into his head . Why should he marry?-- He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother 's children . He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart ."
George Knightley	""" My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax--"
George Knightley	""" Nonsense ! He does not care about Jane Fairfax . In the way of love , I am sure he does not . He would do any good to her , or her family ; but--"
George Knightley	""" For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates . Little things do not irritate him . She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice . But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does . I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax ! The interest he takes in her-- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice ! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh ! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody-- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley ? I can not help suspecting him . I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love ."

Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , can not even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.-- He had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him.-- He is a fortunate man"

George Knightley	"Well , well , means to make her an offer then . Will that do ? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it .

He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _ your _ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him . I was very much pleased with all that he said . I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin . He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging . He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage . He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother . I had no hesitation in advising him to marry . He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better . I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy . If he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , I dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . This happened the night before last . Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard 's to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch . """
George Knightley	"Certainly , """
George Knightley	"I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . Was not she the whole day with you ? """
George Knightley	"Come , """
George Knightley	"I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused . """
George Knightley	"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is the foolish girl about ? """
George Knightley	"Oh ! to be sure , """
George Knightley	"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer . """
George Knightley	"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too . Emma , this is your doing . You persuaded her to refuse him . """
George Knightley	"And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong . Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man , but I can not admit him to be Harriet 's equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples . It is a pity that they were ever got over . """
George Knightley	"Not Harriet 's equal ! """
George Knightley	"No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation . Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you . What are Harriet Smith 's claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than Robert Martin ? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations . She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school . She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well . The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck . Even _ your _ satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend 's leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match . ' """
George Knightley	"I can not help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing . What ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more , ) a good match for my intimate friend ! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own ! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings . I assure you mine are very different . I must think your statement by no means fair . You are not just to Harriet 's claims . They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation . """
George Knightley	"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer ! """
George Knightley	"As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense . She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman 's daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen 's daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin . """
George Knightley	"Whoever might be her parents , """
George Knightley	"whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society . After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard 's hands to shift as she can;--to move , in short , in Mrs. Goddard 's line , to have Mrs. Goddard 's acquaintance . Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _ was _ good enough . She desired nothing better herself . Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer . She had no sense of superiority then . If she has it now , you have given it . You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma . Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . I know him well . He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion . And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know . Depend upon it he had encouragement . """
George Knightley	"Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too . Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do . """
George Knightley	"To be sure ! """
George Knightley	"I know _ that _ is the feeling of you all . I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment . Oh ! Harriet may pick and chuse . Were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you . And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ? No -- pray let her have time to look about her . """
George Knightley	"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy , """
George Knightley	"though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet . You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl . Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , ) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master 's son . """
George Knightley	"We think so very differently on this point , Mr. Knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it . We shall only be making each other more angry . But as to my _ letting _ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application . She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do . His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now . I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey - Mill , find him disagreeable . But the case is altered now . She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet . """
George Knightley	"Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable . Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma 's side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer . He was thinking . The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . """
George Knightley	""""
George Knightley	"said Emma , laughing again . """
George Knightley	""""
George Knightley	"I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news . """
George Knightley	"I am afraid , """
George Knightley	"I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . """
George Knightley	"It is so , indeed , """
George Knightley	"I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . """
George Knightley	"You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject . """
George Knightley	"and been accepted . """
George Knightley	"Good God ! """
George Knightley	""" Emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected . His situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more . His good sense and good principles would delight you.--As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands . His rank in society I would alter if I could , which is saying a great deal I assure you , Emma.--You laugh at me about William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin ."
George Knightley	""" You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match . I think Harriet is doing extremely well . _ Her _ connexions may be worse than _ his _ . In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are . I have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize . You can not imagine how suddenly it has come on me ! how peculiarly unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before ."
George Knightley	""" You ought to know your friend best ,"
George Knightley	""" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her ."
George Knightley	""" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin ,"
George Knightley	""" Do you dare say this ?"
George Knightley	""" I am quite sure ,"
George Knightley	""" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so . He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do . He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends . Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs. Goddard ? I assured him that I could not . Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day ."
George Knightley	""""
George Knightley	""" He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character . The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced ."
George Knightley	"I shall be very glad to look it over , """
George Knightley	"but it seems long . I will take it home with me at night . """
George Knightley	"Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman 's letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference . """
George Knightley	"Humph ! a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way . One man 's style must not be the rule of another 's . We will not be severe . """
George Knightley	"It will be natural for me , """
George Knightley	"Not at all . I should wish it . """
George Knightley	"He trifles here , """
George Knightley	"as to the temptation . He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the engagement.--`His father 's disposition:'-- he is unjust , however , to his father . Mr. Weston 's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true ; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here . """
George Knightley	"I was not quite impartial in my judgment , Emma:--but yet , I think-- had _ you _ not been in the case -- I should still have distrusted him . """
George Knightley	"the pianoforte ! Ah ! That was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure . A boyish scheme , indeed!--I can not comprehend a man 's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument 's coming if she could . """
George Knightley	"I perfectly agree with you , sir,""--was then his remark . """
George Knightley	"And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax 's sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , """
George Knightley	"Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable . Her own behaviour had been so very improper ! She was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look . It was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist . """
George Knightley	"was his next observation.--""His feelings are natural.-- What ! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each-- she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well , he must be a most extraordinary-- """
George Knightley	"Nay , nay , read on.--You will find how very much he suffers . """
George Knightley	"I hope he does , """
George Knightley	` Smallridge!' --What does this mean ? What is all this ?
George Knightley	""" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge 's children-- a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment ?"
George Knightley	""" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs. Elton . Only one page more . I shall soon have done . What a letter the man writes !"
George Knightley	""" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him ."
George Knightley	""" Well , there _ is _ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.--Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her . ` Dearer , much dearer than ever . ' I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve . ' Come , he knows himself there . ` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune . ' --Those were Miss Woodhouse 's words , were they?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter . The child of good fortune ! That was your name for him , was it"
George Knightley	""" "" You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still you must , at least I hope you must , think the better of him for it . I hope it does him some service with you"
George Knightley	""" "" Yes , certainly it does .

And now , let me talk to you of something else . I have another person 's interest at present so much at heart , that I can not think any longer about Frank Churchill . Ever since I left you this morning , Emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject"
George Knightley	". "" Ah ! there is one difficulty unprovided for"
George Knightley	""" You are right , Mrs. Weston ,"
George Knightley	""" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton . Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her ."
George Knightley	""" Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered ,"
George Knightley	"very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period . """
George Knightley	"The Churchills are very likely in fault , """
George Knightley	"but I dare say he might come if he would . """
George Knightley	""" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it . He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner-- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do . Respect would be added to affection . They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . Respect for right conduct is felt by every body . If he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his ."
George Knightley	""" Then it would not be so strong a sense . If it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction ."
George Knightley	""" Me!--not at all ,"

George Knightley	""" You will excuse my being so much over - powered . If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts ."
George Knightley	""" And mine ,"

George Knightley	"the person has not chosen ill . I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell 's taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _ all _ _ that _ _ party _ would particularly prize .

George Knightley	"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax . I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument 's coming to hand .

George Knightley	"it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;--let me live them over again . You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time .

George Knightley	"Here is something quite new to me . Do you know it?--Cramer.-- And here are a new set of Irish melodies . That , from such a quarter , one might expect . This was all sent with the instrument . Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here . I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart . Nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete . True affection only could have prompted it .

George Knightley	"Well , I am so sorry!--Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?-- Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . """
George Knightley	"Oh ! very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes . And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England .

George Knightley	"What is the matter now ? """
George Knightley	"To think of your sending us all your store apples . You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . We really are so shocked ! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry .

I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . How do you like it?--Selina 's choice -- handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery . I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery are every thing . I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . Do you think it will look well ? """

Anna Weston	"A. W. """
Anna Weston	If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.-- You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.-- But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent . My courage rises while I write . It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards . This was the fact . My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question . I shall not discuss it here . For my temptation to _ think _ it a right , I refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in Highbury . I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness . Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence . If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband 's son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid . You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _ you _ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father 's compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you . My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point . And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation . With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation.-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought.-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.--I can not deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me . We seemed to understand each other . From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I can not say;--when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree.-- She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part . I can not doubt it . You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize . She frequently gave me hints of it . I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss . While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to . My heart was in Highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion . If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account.-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F-- , who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her.-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to . You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself.-- No description can describe her . She must tell you herself what she is-- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her.-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend . I want to have your opinion of her looks . I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit . Perhaps it is paid already . Let me hear from you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand particulars . Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery . When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle 's generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger . If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet . My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add to this long letter . You have not heard all that you ought to hear . I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult . , as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose . I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.-- But I had no choice . The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be.--It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me . I behaved shamefully . And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W. , in being unpleasant to Miss F. , were highly blameable . _ She _ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough.--My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold . But she was always right . If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.-- Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There _ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis . I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it . She absolutely refused to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable . Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected.-- I was mad enough , however , to resent.--I doubted her affection . I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W. , as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.-- In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible . Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party . Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.-- ` Jane , ' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you . Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority . Have patience with me , I shall soon have done.-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.-- _ She _ _ felt _ _ the _ _ engagement _ _ to _ _ be _ _ a _ _ source _ _ of _ _ repentance _ _ and _ _ misery _ _ to _ _ each _ : _ she _ _ dissolved _ _ it_.--This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt 's death . I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and -- may I add?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at-- : in short , the full direction to Mr. Smallridge 's , near Bristol , stared me in the face . I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing . It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy . For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me.--Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post.-- What was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle . Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.-- I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man ! with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake?--No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her . Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey . A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away . But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment 's uneasiness can ever occur between us again . Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before . A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me the child of good fortune . I hope she is right.--In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL .

Anna Weston	"this paper is worse than I expected . Look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined . """
Anna Weston	"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs . """
Anna Weston	"I wish , """
Anna Weston	"one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be . """
Anna Weston	"Well -- if you please , """
Anna Weston	"if you think she will be of any use . """
Anna Weston	"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , """
Anna Weston	"She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . She will not even listen to your questions . I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates . """
Anna Weston	"But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk . And I need not bring the whole family , you know . """
Anna Weston	"Aye , do , Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once . She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . Fetch Miss Bates . We are growing a little too nice . She is a standing lesson of how to be happy . But fetch them both . Invite them both . """
Anna Weston	"Both sir ! Can the old lady ? """
Anna Weston	"The old lady ! No , the young lady , to be sure . I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . """
Anna Weston	"Oh ! I beg your pardon , sir . I did not immediately recollect . Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both . """
Anna Weston	"For my companion tells me , """
Anna Weston	"that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning . I was not aware of it myself . I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now . """
Anna Weston	"Would not she give him her support?--would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection ? He could not be satisfied without a promise-- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ? """
Anna Weston	"So scrupulous for others , """
Anna Weston	"and yet so careless for herself ! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . Is this fair , Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us . Have not I some right to complain ? I am sure of your kind support and aid . """
Anna Weston	"all young people would have their little whims . """
Anna Weston	"Well , sir , """
Anna Weston	"as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . """
Anna Weston	"But , my dear sir , """
Anna Weston	"if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party . """
Anna Weston	"And no great harm if it does , """
Anna Weston	"The sooner every party breaks up , the better . """
Anna Weston	"This is a pleasure , """
Anna Weston	"coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated . You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed . """
Anna Weston	"What ! """
Anna Weston	"have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate . """
Anna Weston	"I have not been working uninterruptedly , """
Anna Weston	"I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe . You see we have been wedging one leg with paper . This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . """
Anna Weston	"If you are very kind , """
Anna Weston	"My advice , """
Anna Weston	"I certainly do feel tempted to give . Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks.-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . The spring I always think requires more than common care . Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . Now do not you feel that you had ? Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . You look as if you would not do such a thing again . """
Anna Weston	"Now , how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend-- your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad.--No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and better.--Now for it . """
Anna Weston	"No , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away . """
Anna Weston	""""
Anna Weston	"Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . """
Harriet Smith	"Oh ! no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way . """
Harriet Smith	"I dare say , """
Harriet Smith	"I dare say she was very much attached to him . """
Harriet Smith	"Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man 's fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . """
Harriet Smith	"Yes , """
Harriet Smith	"and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . Well , I wish them happy with all my heart . And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again . He is just as superior as ever;--but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery . To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort!-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . Happy creature ! He called her ` Augusta . ' How delightful ! """
Harriet Smith	"It was as much as Emma could bear , without being impolite . The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an _ introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton's -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live!-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk indeed ! She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly ; """
Harriet Smith	""" Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . It was being very deficient ."
Harriet Smith	the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion . Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody . Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs. Goddard 's school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder . This was all that was generally known of her history . She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young
Harriet Smith	who had been at school there with her . She was a very
Harriet Smith	beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired . She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith 's conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior
Harriet Smith	""" she is a very elegant young woman ."
Harriet Smith	""" Yes ,"
Harriet Smith	"Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are . But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do . """
Harriet Smith	"You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse . I want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries , I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer 's daughter , without education . """
Harriet Smith	"To be sure . Yes . Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up . However , I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's -- and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife . I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it . """
Harriet Smith	"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd ! It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls . He did not think we ever walked this road . He thought we walked towards Randalls most days . He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet . He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow . So very odd we should happen to meet ! Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ? What do you think of him ? Do you think him so very plain ? """
Harriet Smith	"He is very plain , undoubtedly -- remarkably plain:--but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility . I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air . I had imagined him , I confess , a degree or two nearer gentility . """
Harriet Smith	"To be sure , """
Harriet Smith	"he is not so genteel as real gentlemen . """
Harriet Smith	"I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin . At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men . I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before . Do not you begin to feel that now ? Were not you struck ? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here . """
Harriet Smith	"Certainly , he is not like Mr. Knightley . He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley . I see the difference plain enough . But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man ! """
Harriet Smith	"There is no saying , indeed , """
Harriet Smith	"Will he , indeed ? That will be very bad . """
Harriet Smith	"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended . He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man . What has he to do with books ? And I have no doubt that he _ will _ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _ us _ . """
Harriet Smith	She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable . Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet 's head . She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict . It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet 's coming to Hartfield . The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency . Mr. Elton 's situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet . He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world . She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet 's there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy . And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like . He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin 's riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton 's admiration .
Harriet Smith	vacancies of Harriet 's mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ;
Harriet Smith	feared , would cure her . Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love . And now , poor girl ! she was
Harriet Smith	worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton . She
Harriet Smith	him somewhere or other . Emma saw him only once ; but
Harriet Smith	much
Harriet Smith	, judged it best for her
Harriet Smith	to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary-- and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration . Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude . It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!-- After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet 's returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance . She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future . She could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be
Harriet Smith	Harriet for visiting . Only half an hour before her friend called for her
Harriet Smith	Mrs. Goddard 's , her evil stars had
Harriet Smith	_ , _ Bath _ , was to be seen under the operation
Harriet Smith	"Why will not you write one yourself for us , Mr. Elton ? """
Harriet Smith	"that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you . """
Harriet Smith	"Oh no ! he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life . The stupidest fellow ! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse""--he stopt a moment--""or Miss Smith could inspire him . """

Harriet Smith	""" This was too true for contradiction . Unwelcome as it was , Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter 's attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them ."
Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	""""

Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	""" Later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again . Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up . His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse 's party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield . If he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come . Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber . He re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it--"
Harriet Smith	"on , "" It might be distressing , for the"
Harriet Smith	"she ; "" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never-- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about"
Harriet Smith	"a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them . """
Harriet Smith	"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be ! I would give any money for it . I almost long to attempt her likeness myself . You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general . But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust . But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me . It would be such a delight to have her picture ! """
Harriet Smith	"Mr. Elton was only too happy . Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace . She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day 's sketch to wish to go on . There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton 's very promising attachment was likely to add . Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr. Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again . """
Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	"replied he . """
Harriet Smith	"said Mr. Knightley . Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr. Elton warmly added , """
Harriet Smith	"cried Mr. Elton , """
Harriet Smith	.
Harriet Smith	!
Harriet Smith	"Just as they always do -- very vulgar . """
Harriet Smith	"They told me something , """
Harriet Smith	"but it is nothing of any consequence . """
Harriet Smith	"They told me -- that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday . """
Harriet Smith	"I do not believe any such thing , """
Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	"said Mrs. Weston , """
Harriet Smith	"He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates 's door . Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern . At last it was all settled , even to the destination of the parcel . """
Harriet Smith	"said the obliging Mrs. Ford . """
Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	"said Harriet , quite satisfied , """
Harriet Smith	"said she , beginning again when they were all in the street . Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix . """
Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	""" She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved . Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father . She was not sorry . She wanted to be alone . Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected . She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational . Her father 's business was to announce James 's being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing . The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet 's welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.--What had she to wish for ? Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own . Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future . Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . She must laugh at such a close ! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! Such a heart -- such a Harriet ! Now there would be pleasure in her returning -- Every thing would be a pleasure . It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin . High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over . The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over . She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty . In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed . They arrived.--Mrs . Weston was alone in the drawing - room:-- but hardly had they been told of the baby , and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window ."
Harriet Smith	"You had better go on , """
Harriet Smith	"Did she know?--had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably . """
Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	""" He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield . There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of-- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection ."
Harriet Smith	"Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over . """
Harriet Smith	"It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish , """
Harriet Smith	"to have no reserves with you on this subject . As I am happily quite an altered creature in _ one _ _ respect _ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me . """
Harriet Smith	"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing ? """
Harriet Smith	"No -- I can not call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much . """
Harriet Smith	"Now , """
Harriet Smith	"you _ must _ recollect . """
Harriet Smith	"No , indeed I do not . """
Harriet Smith	"Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat -- just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came-- I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?-- But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it-- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat . """
Harriet Smith	"Here , """
Harriet Smith	"here is something still more valuable , I mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . """
Harriet Smith	"This was really his , """

Harriet Smith	""" Well , go on ."
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! that 's all . I have nothing more to shew you , or to say-- except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it ."
Harriet Smith	""" My poor dear Harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ?"
Harriet Smith	""" Yes , simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them . It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them ."
Harriet Smith	""" But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful ."

Harriet Smith	"Ought to refuse him ! My dear Harriet , what do you mean ? Are you in any doubt as to that ? I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake . I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _ purport _ of your answer . I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it . """
Harriet Smith	"I shall not give you any advice , Harriet . I will have nothing to do with it . This is a point which you must settle with your feelings . """
Harriet Smith	"I had no notion that he liked me so very much , """
Harriet Smith	"You could not have visited me ! """
Harriet Smith	"No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before . That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world . """
Harriet Smith	"Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been . You would have thrown yourself out of all good society . I must have given you up . """
Harriet Smith	"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it ! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more ! """
Harriet Smith	"I do not think he is conceited either , in general , """
Harriet Smith	"at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _ one _ is so very handsome and agreeable . However , I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration . """
Harriet Smith	"Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend . We will not be parted . A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter . """
Harriet Smith	"Now he has got my letter , """
Harriet Smith	"_ He _ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed!--and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto . No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched . Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different.-- Still , however , I must be on my guard . This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man-- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable.-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily . """
Harriet Smith	"This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself . Harriet was remembered only from being _ her _ friend . His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs. Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again . Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her . Her intentions were unchanged . Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness . His recollection of Harriet , and the words which clothed it , the """
Harriet Smith	"suggested to her the idea of Harriet 's succeeding her in his affections . Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For Harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed . """
Harriet Smith	"said she.--""I must not think of it . I know the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure . """
Harriet Smith	"I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . These are the motives which I have been pressing on you . They are very important -- and sorry I am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them . My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . I want you to save yourself from greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me . """
Harriet Smith	"You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life-- Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do for you!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been ! """
Harriet Smith	"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart , """
Harriet Smith	"There is nothing to be compared to it . Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will . It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity.-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing . Oh ! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife-- a sensible man 's wife -- it is invaluable . I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet ! """

"" He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and , with good manners , like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late . He was not in his best spirits , but seemed trying to improve them ; and , at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably . They were looking over views in"
Frank Churchill	has written to Mrs. Weston ? I understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed . Mr. Woodhouse told me of it
Frank Churchill	""" and"
Frank Churchill	""" and"
Frank Churchill	""" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward . Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma 's resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested her . She had frequently thought -- especially since his father 's marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _ were _ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition . He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;-- for when happily released from Mr. Elton , and seated by Mr. Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her ,"
Frank Churchill	""" continued Mr. Weston ,"
Frank Churchill	""" It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it ,"
Frank Churchill	""" though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _ home _ I felt I might do any thing ."
Frank Churchill	""" But when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please-- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her . He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter . He understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else ."
Frank Churchill	""" He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor 's merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse 's character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor 's . And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person ."
Frank Churchill	""" There is no necessity for my calling this morning ,"
Frank Churchill	""" another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which--"
Frank Churchill	""" Oh ! go to - day , go to - day . Do not defer it . What is right to be done can not be done too soon . And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _ here _ should be carefully avoided . You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on . If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
Frank Churchill	""" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me ."
Frank Churchill	""" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street ."
Frank Churchill	""" My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates 's , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump ."
Frank Churchill	"Miss Woodhouse , """
Frank Churchill	"have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ? It used to stand here . Where is it ? This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . We had great amusement with those letters one morning . I want to puzzle you again . """
Frank Churchill	"I will give it to her -- shall I?"" --and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth ."
Frank Churchill	""" It was done however . This gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it . Mr. Knightley 's excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _ Dixon _ . Jane Fairfax 's perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged . She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only ,"

Frank Churchill	""" Perhaps it is as well ,"
Frank Churchill	"He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed-- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off .

Frank Churchill	"In short , """
Frank Churchill	"perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion""-- He looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts . She hardly knew what to say . It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish . Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said , """
Frank Churchill	"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield . My regard for Hartfield is most warm""-- He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed.-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ? Mr. Woodhouse soon followed ; and the necessity of exertion made him composed . A very few minutes more , however , completed the present trial . Mr. Weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , """
Frank Churchill	"said she . """

Frank Churchill	""" Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof ."
Frank Churchill	""" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _ I _ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me . I could not excuse a man 's having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ?"
Frank Churchill	""" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
Frank Churchill	""" One would rather have a stranger preferred than one 's very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself!-- Poor Mrs. Dixon ! Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland ."
Frank Churchill	""" You are right . It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it ."
Frank Churchill	""" So much the better -- or so much the worse:--I do not know which . But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself . She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction ."
Frank Churchill	""" As to that -- I do not--"
Frank Churchill	""" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax 's sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself . But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon , one may guess what one chuses ."
Frank Churchill	""" There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--"
Frank Churchill	""" however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were-- how it might all be behind the scenes . I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be ."
Frank Churchill	""" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . But we never did . I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."
Frank Churchill	""" It is a most repulsive quality , indeed ,"
Frank Churchill	""" Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing . There is safety in reserve , but no attraction . One can not love a reserved person ."
Frank Churchill	""" Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body 's reserve to procure one . Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question . I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal ."
Frank Churchill	". "" Who is that gentleman on horseback"

Frank Churchill	affection . And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . They were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of
Frank Churchill	, and afterwards in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse 's ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation
Frank Churchill	interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed . Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke
Frank Churchill	amiable feelings .
Frank Churchill	a couple of pair of

Frank Churchill	. He was immediately interested . Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of
Frank Churchill	minutes at
Frank Churchill	open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased . He saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested . No , it was long enough , broad enough , handsome enough . It would hold the very number for comfort . They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter . Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury ! The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied . He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body 's returning into their proper place the next morning . He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing ; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills . He seemed to have all the life and spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe . Of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind . He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap . It was but an effusion of lively spirits . At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown
Frank Churchill	"the house where the Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it . "" Yes , oh ! yes""--he replied ; "" I was just going to mention it . A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . As it was , I was only betrayed into"
Frank Churchill	"is it ? Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.-- A most deplorable want of complexion .

Frank Churchill	"them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . "" Well , "" said Emma , "" there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion .

When the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , "" Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? "" said Frank Churchill . "" Ever hear her ! "" repeated Emma .

"" He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions ,"
Frank Churchill	of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected . His ideas seemed more moderate-- his feelings warmer . She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton 's house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with . No , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having
Frank Churchill	If it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house . There must
Frank Churchill	ample room in it for every real comfort . The man must be a blockhead who wanted more . Mrs. Weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about . Used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size , he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one . But Emma , in her own mind

VII Emma 's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to
Frank Churchill	at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut . There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ;

One can not creep upon a journey ; one can not help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one 's friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs ."
Mr. Weston	""" said he ;"
Mr. Weston	""""
Mr. Weston	""" said Emma ;"
Mr. Weston	""""
Mr. Weston	""" he replied ;"
Mr. Weston	""" Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance . She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable . She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about . His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening . Her own father 's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance . Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.-- Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged , he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any ; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons ' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them . She blessed the favouring blindness . He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill 's accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night . A reasonable visit paid , Mr. Weston began to move.--""He must be going . He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford 's , but he need not hurry any body else ."
Mr. Weston	""" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ?"
Mr. Weston	""" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way ."
Mr. Weston	"answered his son;--""but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way . """
Mr. Weston	"I doubt its being very clever myself , """
Mr. Weston	"said Jane to her aunt , """

Mr. Weston	"They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley . Mr. Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man 's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant . Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _ her _ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure . Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again . While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr. Knightley by her side . He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , """
Mr. Weston	""" "" Upon my honour"
Mr. Weston	", "" it does not . It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley"
Mr. Weston	". "" I was wrong"
Mr. Weston	", "" in talking of its being _ broke _ to you . I should not have used the expression . In fact , it does not concern you-- it concerns only myself,--that is , we hope.--Humph!--In short , my dear Emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it . I do n't say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but things might be much worse.--If we walk fast , we shall soon be at Randalls"
Mr. Weston	", "" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did"
Mr. Weston	". ' "" She met Mr. Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance ,"
Mr. Weston	"daughter . "" A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate . His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have"
Mr. Weston	"So unreasonably early ! """
Mr. Weston	"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! """
Mr. Weston	"I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . """
Mr. Weston	"Read it , read it , """
Mr. Weston	"it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma . """
Mr. Weston	"Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think . Well , what do you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I?--Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me?--In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _ she _ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday . As to her illness , all nothing of course . But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . This is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good news , is not it ? Have you finished it ? Has Emma read it all ? Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . """
Mr. Weston	"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you , """
Mr. Weston	"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , """
Mr. Weston	"and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name . """
Mr. Weston	"Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage . """
Mr. Weston	"You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure.-- He is to be in town next week , if not sooner . We have notice of it in a letter to - day . I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son 's hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs. Weston . She is his principal correspondent , I assure you . I hardly ever get a letter . """
Mr. Weston	"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! Oh ! Mr. Weston-- ( laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.--Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh ! Mr. Weston , I could not have believed it of you ! """
Mr. Weston	"Aye , we men are sad fellows . You must take care of yourself , Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs. Churchill 's account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her-- so they are all to move southward without loss of time . """
Mr. Weston	"Indeed!--from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in Yorkshire ? """
Mr. Weston	"Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London . a considerable journey . """
Mr. Weston	"Yes , upon my word , very considerable . Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London . But what is distance , Mr. Weston , to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr. Suckling , sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me-- but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses . """
Mr. Weston	"The evil of the distance from Enscombe , """
Mr. Weston	"is , that Mrs. Churchill , _ as _ _ we _ _ understand _ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . In Frank 's last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle 's ! This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word . Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs. Elton . You must grant me that . """
Mr. Weston	"No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing . I Always take the part of my own sex . I do indeed . I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always stand up for women-- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill 's making incredible exertions to avoid it . Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety . She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . Does Mrs. Churchill do the same ? """
Mr. Weston	"Depend upon it , Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for""-- Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with , """

Philip Elton	"Emma was quite at a loss . The tone implied some old acquaintance-- and how could she possibly guess ? """
Philip Elton	"continued Mrs. Elton ; """
Philip Elton	""" Well , my dear ,"
Philip Elton	""" considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you . She speaks a little too quick . A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . But I believe I am nice ; I do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor . However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife . Though I think he had better not have married . I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _ should _ in the course of the summer . But I ought to have gone before . Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss . Ah ! it shews what a sad invalid I am ! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane ."
Philip Elton	""" Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is . And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies ."
Philip Elton	""" My dear , you do not understand me . This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry ."
Philip Elton	"Mr. Elton is so good to the poor ! """
Philip Elton	"Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!"" -- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet 's , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton 's nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to . She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words"

Philip Elton	married _ , to a gentleman

Philip Elton	! That was the wind -
Philip Elton	the glory of Miss Hawkins . Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all ! She had talked her into love ; but , alas ! she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the

Philip Elton	walked by the house -- the
Philip Elton	engagement
Philip Elton	of meeting Mr. Martin . The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin 's calling at Mrs. Goddard 's a few days afterwards . Harriet had not been
Philip Elton	home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a
Philip Elton	mixture of reproach , with a
Philip Elton	till Mr. Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess . But Mr. Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares . While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it

Philip Elton	butcher 's cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank . She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk
Philip Elton	which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had
Philip Elton	her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour . She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell . The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and Miss Smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young
Philip Elton	. She came solitarily down the gravel walk --
Philip Elton	parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility . Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account . She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating . She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls . They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time-- till just at last ,

There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window . _ He _ had done it . They all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must suspect , as ready as the best

Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye ! She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , """
Philip Elton	"What can it be , Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be ? I have not an idea -- I can not guess it in the least . What can it possibly be ? Do try to find it out , Miss Woodhouse .

And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . Can it be Neptune ? Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! Or a trident ? or a mermaid ? or a shark ? Oh , no ! shark is only one syllable . It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ? """
Philip Elton	"Mermaids and sharks ! Nonsense ! My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ?

There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you . """

Philip Elton	""" Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear . The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind ."
Philip Elton	""" said she , presently -- her cheeks in a glow--""to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this ."

Philip Elton	""" I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _ I _ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _ I _ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ) , he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life ."

Philip Elton	"Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard 's for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour . After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with-- """
Philip Elton	""""
Philip Elton	"replied Emma ; """
Philip Elton	"she replied with a smile of astonishment , """
Philip Elton	"and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . He said no more . Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it . The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time . Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour . The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent . """
Philip Elton	"We are sure of excellent fires , """
Philip Elton	"and every thing in the greatest comfort . Charming people , Mr. and Mrs. Weston;-- Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any . Mr. Weston 's dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two . I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma , ) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr. Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings . """
Philip Elton	"You have given Miss Smith all that she required , """
Philip Elton	"you have made her graceful and easy . She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature . """
Philip Elton	"If it were admissible to contradict a lady , """
Philip Elton	"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before . """
Philip Elton	"Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me . So much superadded decision of character ! Skilful has been the hand ! """
Philip Elton	"Let me entreat you , """
Philip Elton	"it would indeed be a delight ! Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend . I know what your drawings are . How could you suppose me ignorant ? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ? """
Philip Elton	"The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December . But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton , than it was removed . His gallantry was always on the alert . """
Philip Elton	""""
Philip Elton	"What a precious deposit ! """
Philip Elton	"I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love . He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so , ' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal . I come in for a pretty good share as a second . But it is his gratitude on Harriet 's account . """
Philip Elton	""" But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects . He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,-- but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer . As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied ,"
Philip Elton	""""
Philip Elton	""" cried Emma ,"
Philip Elton	""""
Philip Elton	""" cried Harriet indignantly.--""Oh ! no""--and Emma could just catch the words ,"
Philip Elton	""" She then took a longer time for consideration . Should she proceed no farther?--should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing?-- Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved.-- She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know . Plain dealing was always best . She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.-- She was decided , and thus spoke--"
Philip Elton	"that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them . """
Mr. Perry	""" Her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent ,"
Mr. Perry	"But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think there will . """
Mr. Perry	"And after all , five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up . Five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it . It will not do to _ invite _ five couple . It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment . """
Mr. Perry	"Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ? """
Mr. Perry	"Oh ! no , """
Mr. Perry	"We were too magnificent , """
Mr. Perry	"We allowed unnecessary room . Ten couple may stand here very well . """
Mr. Perry	"It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ? """
Mr. Perry	"Very true , """
Mr. Perry	"it was very bad . """
Mr. Perry	"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . """
Mr. Perry	"There is no denying it , """
Mr. Perry	"I agree with you exactly . A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . Exquisite , quite exquisite!--Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . It would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- I do not know that -- I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . """
Mr. Perry	"Well , Miss Woodhouse , """
Mr. Perry	"your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father 's little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a thought of my father 's , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ? """
Mr. Perry	"The Crown ! """
Mr. Perry	"Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . It is his own idea . Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel . Oh ! you were perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield . Is not it a good exchange?--You consent-- I hope you consent ? """
Mr. Perry	"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not . I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- It seems the only improvement that could be . Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ? """
Mr. Perry	"No ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan-- much worse than the other . A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls . He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh ! no -- a very bad plan . They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere . """
Mr. Perry	"I was going to observe , sir , """
Mr. Perry	"that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body 's catching cold-- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls ! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could . """
Mr. Perry	"From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief . """
Mr. Perry	"Ah ! sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected . I have often known it done myself . """
Mr. Perry	"Have you indeed , sir?--Bless me ! I never could have supposed it . But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear . However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . One can not resolve upon them in a hurry . If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . """
Mr. Perry	"So they will , my dear . That is a great thing . Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted ? I doubt it . I do not know her , even by sight . """
Mr. Perry	"I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston 's care . Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole . """
Mr. Perry	"There , papa!--Now you must be satisfied -- Our own dear Mrs. Weston , who is carefulness itself . Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ? ` If _ Miss _ _ Taylor _ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . ' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! """
Mr. Perry	"Aye , very true . Mr. Perry did say so . I shall never forget it . Poor little Emma ! You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry 's great attention . He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . I hope whenever poor Isabella 's little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . """
Mr. Perry	"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , """
Mr. Perry	"examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both . It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . """
Mr. Perry	"My dear , you are too particular , """
Mr. Perry	"What does all that signify ? You will see nothing of it by candlelight . It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight . We never see any thing of it on our club - nights . """
Mr. Perry	"Men never know when things are dirty or not ; """
Mr. Perry	"Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares . """
Mr. Perry	"Yes , very true , """
Mr. Perry	"very true . You want your neighbours ' opinions . I do not wonder at you . If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the Coles , for instance . They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ? She is still nearer.-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . I think we do want a larger council . Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ? """
Isabella Knightley	""" Oh , Mrs. Churchill ; every body knows Mrs. Churchill ,"
Isabella Knightley	""" and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion . To be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful . It is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery . What a blessing , that she never had any children ! Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !"
Isabella Knightley	"very cold , certainly very cold , """
Isabella Knightley	"But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr. Elton 's only objection , and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . It was a done thing ; Mr. Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her . """
John Knightley	""""
John Knightley	"Yes , """
John Knightley	"and I think we shall have a good deal of it . """
John Knightley	"Christmas weather , """
John Knightley	"I can not wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls . """
John Knightley	"I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body . """
John Knightley	"Indeed ! ( in a tone of wonder and pity , ) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery . Well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment . """
John Knightley	"My first enjoyment , """
John Knightley	"will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again . """
John Knightley	"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir . Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow . """
John Knightley	"I admired your resolution very much , sir , """
John Knightley	"in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon . Every body must have seen the snow coming on . I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well . Another hour or two 's snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand . I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight . """
John Knightley	""" cried he , affronted in his turn :"
John Knightley	""""
John Knightley	""""
John Knightley	""" the young lady 's pride would now be contented ;"
John Knightley	""" she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ;"
John Knightley	""" Rather he than I!"" -- But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--""Poor Knightley ! poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities.-- How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love-- not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him ! But that would be all over now.-- Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _ her _ . Oh ! no ; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every thing.--Extremely disagreeable ! But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan , living together . It would never do . She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter"
Robert Martin	"Mr. Knightley 's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with _ him _ . You might not see one in a hundred with _ gentleman _ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley . But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton ? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _ them _ . Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent . You must see the difference . """
Robert Martin	"Oh yes!--there is a great difference . But Mr. Weston is almost an old man . Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty . """
Robert Martin	"Which makes his good manners the more valuable . The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes . What is passable in youth is detestable in later age . Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr. Weston 's time of life ? """
Robert Martin	"But there may be pretty good guessing . He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss . """
Robert Martin	"I wonder he did not remember the book""--was all Harriet 's answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself . She , therefore , said no more for some time . Her next beginning was , """
Robert Martin	"Nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked ! """
Robert Martin	""" Frank Churchill caught the name ."
Robert Martin	""" said he to Emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax 's eye ."
Robert Martin	""" Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane 's countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf ."
Robert Martin	""" he cried ."
