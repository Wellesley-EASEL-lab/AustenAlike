{"document": "XLIV Seven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone , when the one letter , the letter from Edmund , so long expected , was put into Fanny \u2019s hands . As she opened , and saw its length , she prepared herself for a minute detail of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards the fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate . These were the contents \u2014 \u201c My Dear Fanny,\u2014Excuse me that I have not written before . Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me , but I found it impossible to write from London , and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence . Could I have sent a few happy lines , they should not have been wanting , but nothing of that nature was ever in my power . I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it . My hopes are much weaker . You are probably aware of this already . So very fond of you as Miss Crawford is , it is most natural that she should tell you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine . I will not be prevented , however , from making my own communication . Our confidences in you need not clash . I ask no questions . There is something soothing in the idea that we have the same friend , and that whatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us , we are united in our love of you . It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are , and what are my present plans , if plans I can be said to have . I have been returned since Saturday . I was three weeks in London , and saw her ( for London ) very often . I had every attention from the Frasers that could be reasonably expected . I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield . It was her manner , however , rather than any unfrequency of meeting . Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered : my first reception was so unlike what I had hoped , that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly . I need not particularise . You know the weak side of her character , and may imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me . She was in high spirits , and surrounded by those who were giving all the support of their own bad sense to her too lively mind . I do not like Mrs. Fraser . She is a cold - hearted , vain woman , who has married entirely from convenience , and though evidently unhappy in her marriage , places her disappointment not to faults of judgment , or temper , or disproportion of age , but to her being , after all , less affluent than many of her acquaintance , especially than her sister , Lady Stornaway , and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious , provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough . I look upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine . They have been leading her astray for years . Could she be detached from them!\u2014and sometimes I do not despair of it , for the affection appears to me principally on their side . They are very fond of her ; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you . When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . I can not give her up , Fanny . She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife . If I did not believe that she had some regard for me , of course I should not say this , but I do believe it . I am convinced that she is not without a decided preference . I have no jealousy of any individual . It is the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of . It is the habits of wealth that I fear . Her ideas are not higher than her own fortune may warrant , but they are beyond what our incomes united could authorise . There is comfort , however , even here . I could better bear to lose her because not rich enough , than because of my profession . That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices , which , in fact , I am scarcely justified in asking ; and , if I am refused , that , I think , will be the honest motive . Her prejudices , I trust , are not so strong as they were . You have my thoughts exactly as they arise , my dear Fanny ; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory , but it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind . Having once begun , it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel . I can not give her up . Connected as we already are , and , I hope , are to be , to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom , under any other distress , I should turn to for consolation . The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny . Were it a decided thing , an actual refusal , I hope I should know how to bear it , and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart , and in the course of a few years \u2014 but I am writing nonsense . Were I refused , I must bear it ; and till I am , I can never cease to try for her . This is the truth . The only question is _ how _ ? What may be the likeliest means ? I have sometimes thought of going to London again after Easter , and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield . Even now , she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June ; but June is at a great distance , and I believe I shall write to her . I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter . To be at an early certainty is a material object . My present state is miserably irksome . Considering everything , I think a letter will be decidedly the best method of explanation . I shall be able to write much that I could not say , and shall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer , and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse ; I think I am . My greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser , and I at a distance unable to help my own cause . A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation , and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision , an adviser may , in an unlucky moment , lead it to do what it may afterwards regret . I must think this matter over a little . This long letter , full of my own concerns alone , will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny . The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser \u2019s party . I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him . There is not a shadow of wavering . He thoroughly knows his own mind , and acts up to his resolutions : an inestimable quality . I could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me , and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends . There was marked coolness on her side . They scarcely spoke . I saw him draw back surprised , and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram . You will wish to hear my opinion of Maria \u2019s degree of comfort as a wife . There is no appearance of unhappiness . I hope they get on pretty well together . I dined twice in Wimpole Street , and might have been there oftener , but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother . Julia seems to enjoy London exceedingly . I had little enjoyment there , but have less here . We are not a lively party . You are very much wanted . I miss you more than I can express . My mother desires her best love , and hopes to hear from you soon . She talks of you almost every hour , and I am sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you . My father means to fetch you himself , but it will not be till after Easter , when he has business in town . You are happy at Portsmouth , I hope , but this must not be a yearly visit . I want you at home , that I may have your opinion about Thornton Lacey . I have little heart for extensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress . I think I shall certainly write . It is quite settled that the Grants go to Bath ; they leave Mansfield on Monday . I am glad of it . I am not comfortable enough to be fit for anybody ; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.\u2014Yours ever , my dearest Fanny . \u201d \u201c I never will , no , I certainly never will wish for a letter again , \u201d was Fanny \u2019s secret declaration as she finished this . \u201c What do they bring but disappointment and sorrow ? Not till after Easter ! How shall I bear it ? And my poor aunt talking of me every hour ! \u201d Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could , but she was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was quite unkind , both to her aunt and to herself . As for the main subject of the letter , there was nothing in that to soothe irritation . She was almost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund . \u201c There is no good in this delay , \u201d said she . \u201c Why is not it settled ? He is blinded , and nothing will open his eyes ; nothing can , after having had truths before him so long in vain . He will marry her , and be poor and miserable . God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be respectable ! \u201d She looked over the letter again . \u201c \u2018 So very fond of me ! \u2019 \u2019 tis nonsense all . She loves nobody but herself and her brother . Her friends leading her astray for years ! She is quite as likely to have led _ them _ astray . They have all , perhaps , been corrupting one another ; but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them , she is the less likely to have been hurt , except by their flattery . \u2018 The only woman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife . \u2019 I firmly believe it . It is an attachment to govern his whole life . Accepted or refused , his heart is wedded to her for ever . \u2018 The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny . \u2019 Edmund , you do not know me . The families would never be connected if you did not connect them ! Oh ! write , write . Finish it at once . Let there be an end of this suspense . Fix , commit , condemn yourself . \u201d Such sensations , however , were too near akin to resentment to be long guiding Fanny \u2019s soliloquies . She was soon more softened and sorrowful . His warm regard , his kind expressions , his confidential treatment , touched her strongly . He was only too good to everybody . It was a letter , in short , which she would not but have had for the world , and which could never be valued enough . This was the end of it . Everybody at all addicted to letter - writing , without having much to say , which will include a large proportion of the female world at least , must feel with Lady Bertram that she was out of luck in having such a capital piece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath , occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it , and will admit that it must have been very mortifying to her to see it fall to the share of her thankless son , and treated as concisely as possible at the end of a long letter , instead of having it to spread over the largest part of a page of her own . For though Lady Bertram rather shone in the epistolary line , having early in her marriage , from the want of other employment , and the circumstance of Sir Thomas \u2019s being in Parliament , got into the way of making and keeping correspondents , and formed for herself a very creditable , common - place , amplifying style , so that a very little matter was enough for her : she could not do entirely without any ; she must have something to write about , even to her niece ; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant \u2019s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant \u2019s morning calls , it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put them to . There was a rich amends , however , preparing for her . Lady Bertram \u2019s hour of good luck came . Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund \u2019s letter , Fanny had one from her aunt , beginning thus \u2014 \u201c My Dear Fanny,\u2014I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming intelligence , which I make no doubt will give you much concern \u201d . This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquaint her with all the particulars of the Grants \u2019 intended journey , for the present intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the pen for many days to come , being no less than the dangerous illness of her eldest son , of which they had received notice by express a few hours before . Tom had gone from London with a party of young men to Newmarket , where a neglected fall and a good deal of drinking had brought on a fever ; and when the party broke up , being unable to move , had been left by himself at the house of one of these young men to the comforts of sickness and solitude , and the attendance only of servants . Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends , as he had then hoped , his disorder increased considerably , and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched to Mansfield . \u201c This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , \u201d observed her ladyship , after giving the substance of it , \u201c has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me . We shall greatly miss Edmund in our small circle , but I trust and hope he will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended , and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly , which Sir Thomas proposes should be done , and thinks best on every account , and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury . As I have little doubt of your feeling for us , my dear Fanny , under these distressing circumstances , I will write again very soon . \u201d Fanny \u2019s feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably more warm and genuine than her aunt \u2019s style of writing . She felt truly for them all . Tom dangerously ill , Edmund gone to attend him , and the sadly small party remaining at Mansfield , were cares to shut out every other care , or almost every other . She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _ had _ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came , but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious . Her aunt did not neglect her : she wrote again and again ; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund , and these accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny , in the same diffuse style , and the same medley of trusts , hopes , and fears , all following and producing each other at haphazard . It was a sort of playing at being frightened . The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not see had little power over her fancy ; and she wrote very comfortably about agitation , and anxiety , and poor invalids , till Tom was actually conveyed to Mansfield , and her own eyes had beheld his altered appearance . Then a letter which she had been previously preparing for Fanny was finished in a different style , in the language of real feeling and alarm ; then she wrote as she might have spoken . \u201c He is just come , my dear Fanny , and is taken upstairs ; and I am so shocked to see him , that I do not know what to do . I am sure he has been very ill . Poor Tom ! I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me . But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to - morrow , and says we must consider his journey . \u201d The real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not soon over . Tom \u2019s extreme impatience to be removed to Mansfield , and experience those comforts of home and family which had been little thought of in uninterrupted health , had probably induced his being conveyed thither too early , as a return of fever came on , and for a week he was in a more alarming state than ever . They were all very seriously frightened . Lady Bertram wrote her daily terrors to her niece , who might now be said to live upon letters , and pass all her time between suffering from that of to - day and looking forward to to - morrow \u2019s . Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin , her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could not spare him , and the purity of her principles added yet a keener solicitude , when she considered how little useful , how little self - denying his life had ( apparently ) been . Susan was her only companion and listener on this , as on more common occasions . Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise . Nobody else could be interested in so remote an evil as illness in a family above an hundred miles off ; not even Mrs. Price , beyond a brief question or two , if she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand , and now and then the quiet observation of , \u201c My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble . \u201d So long divided and so differently situated , the ties of blood were little more than nothing . An attachment , originally as tranquil as their tempers , was now become a mere name . Mrs. Price did quite as much for Lady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price . Three or four Prices might have been swept away , any or all except Fanny and William , and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it ; or perhaps might have caught from Mrs. Norris \u2019s lips the ca nt of its being a very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price to have them so well provided for .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [29, 30], "text": "Fanny"},
