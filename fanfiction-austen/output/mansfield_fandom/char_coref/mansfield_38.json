{"document": "XXXVIII The novelty of travelling , and the happiness of being with William , soon produced their natural effect on Fanny \u2019s spirits , when Mansfield Park was fairly left behind ; and by the time their first stage was ended , and they were to quit Sir Thomas \u2019s carriage , she was able to take leave of the old coachman , and send back proper messages , with cheerful looks . Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end . Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William \u2019s mind , and he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher - toned subjects , all of which ended , if they did not begin , in praise of the Thrush , conjectures how she would be employed , schemes for an action with some superior force , which ( supposing the first lieutenant out of the way , and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant ) was to give himself the next step as soon as possible , or speculations upon prize - money , which was to be generously distributed at home , with only the reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable , in which he and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life together . Fanny \u2019s immediate concerns , as far as they involved Mr. Crawford , made no part of their conversation . William knew what had passed , and from his heart lamented that his sister \u2019s feelings should be so cold towards a man whom he must consider as the first of human characters ; but he was of an age to be all for love , and therefore unable to blame ; and knowing her wish on the subject , he would not distress her by the slightest allusion . She had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford . She had heard repeatedly from his sister within the three weeks which had passed since their leaving Mansfield , and in each letter there had been a few lines from himself , warm and determined like his speeches . It was a correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she had feared . Miss Crawford \u2019s style of writing , lively and affectionate , was itself an evil , independent of what she was thus forced into reading from the brother \u2019s pen , for Edmund would never rest till she had read the chief of the letter to him ; and then she had to listen to his admiration of her language , and the warmth of her attachments . There had , in fact , been so much of message , of allusion , of recollection , so much of Mansfield in every letter , that Fanny could not but suppose it meant for him to hear ; and to find herself forced into a purpose of that kind , compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her the addresses of the man she did not love , and obliging her to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did , was cruelly mortifying . Here , too , her present removal promised advantage . When no longer under the same roof with Edmund , she trusted that Miss Crawford would have no motive for writing strong enough to overcome the trouble , and that at Portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into nothing . With such thoughts as these , among ten hundred others , Fanny proceeded in her journey safely and cheerfully , and as expeditiously as could rationally be hoped in the dirty month of February . They entered Oxford , but she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund \u2019s college as they passed along , and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury , where a comfortable meal , uniting dinner and supper , wound up the enjoyments and fatigues of the day . The next morning saw them off again at an early hour ; and with no events , and no delays , they regularly advanced , and were in the environs of Portsmouth while there was yet daylight for Fanny to look around her , and wonder at the new buildings . They passed the drawbridge , and entered the town ; and the light was only beginning to fail as , guided by William \u2019s powerful voice , they were rattled into a narrow street , leading from the High Street , and drawn up before the door of a small house now inhabited by Mr. Price . Fanny was all agitation and flutter ; all hope and apprehension . The moment they stopped , a trollopy - looking maidservant , seemingly in waiting for them at the door , stepped forward , and more intent on telling the news than giving them any help , immediately began with , \u201c The Thrush is gone out of harbour , please sir , and one of the officers has been here to \u2014 \u201d She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven years old , who , rushing out of the house , pushed the maid aside , and while William was opening the chaise - door himself , called out , \u201c You are just in time . We have been looking for you this half - hour . The Thrush went out of harbour this morning . I saw her . It was a beautiful sight . And they think she will have her orders in a day or two . And Mr. Campbell was here at four o\u2019clock to ask for you : he has got one of the Thrush \u2019s boats , and is going off to her at six , and hoped you would be here in time to go with him . \u201d A stare or two at Fanny , as William helped her out of the carriage , was all the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed ; but he made no objection to her kissing him , though still entirely engaged in detailing farther particulars of the Thrush \u2019s going out of harbour , in which he had a strong right of interest , being to commence his career of seamanship in her at this very time . Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance - passage of the house , and in her mother \u2019s arms , who met her there with looks of true kindness , and with features which Fanny loved the more , because they brought her aunt Bertram \u2019s before her , and there were her two sisters : Susan , a well - grown fine girl of fourteen , and Betsey , the youngest of the family , about five \u2014 both glad to see her in their way , though with no advantage of manner in receiving her . But manner Fanny did not want . Would they but love her , she should be satisfied . She was then taken into a parlour , so small that her first conviction was of its being only a passage - room to something better , and she stood for a moment expecting to be invited on ; but when she saw there was no other door , and that there were signs of habitation before her , she called back her thoughts , reproved herself , and grieved lest they should have been suspected . Her mother , however , could not stay long enough to suspect anything . She was gone again to the street - door , to welcome William . \u201c Oh ! my dear William , how glad I am to see you . But have you heard about the Thrush ? She is gone out of harbour already ; three days before we had any thought of it ; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam \u2019s things , they will never be ready in time ; for she may have her orders to - morrow , perhaps . It takes me quite unawares . And now you must be off for Spithead too . Campbell has been here , quite in a worry about you ; and now what shall we do ? I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you , and here everything comes upon me at once . \u201d Her son answered cheerfully , telling her that everything was always for the best ; and making light of his own inconvenience in being obliged to hurry away so soon . \u201c To be sure , I had much rather she had stayed in harbour , that I might have sat a few hours with you in comfort ; but as there is a boat ashore , I had better go off at once , and there is no help for it . Whereabouts does the Thrush lay at Spithead ? Near the Canopus ? But no matter ; here \u2019s Fanny in the parlour , and why should we stay in the passage ? Come , mother , you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet . \u201d In they both came , and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her daughter again , and commented a little on her growth , began with very natural solicitude to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers . \u201c Poor dears ! how tired you must both be ! and now , what will you have ? I began to think you would never come . Betsey and I have been watching for you this half - hour . And when did you get anything to eat ? And what would you like to have now ? I could not tell whether you would be for some meat , or only a dish of tea , after your journey , or else I would have got something ready . And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak , and we have no butcher at hand . It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street . We were better off in our last house . Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got . \u201d They both declared they should prefer it to anything . \u201c Then , Betsey , my dear , run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on ; and tell her to bring in the tea - things as soon as she can . I wish we could get the bell mended ; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger . \u201d Betsey went with alacrity , proud to shew her abilities before her fine new sister . \u201c Dear me ! \u201d continued the anxious mother , \u201c what a sad fire we have got , and I dare say you are both starved with cold . Draw your chair nearer , my dear . I can not think what Rebecca has been about . I am sure I told her to bring some coals half an hour ago . Susan , you should have taken care of the fire . \u201d \u201c I was upstairs , mama , moving my things , \u201d said Susan , in a fearless , self - defending tone , which startled Fanny . \u201c You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room ; and I could not get Rebecca to give me any help . \u201d Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles : first , the driver came to be paid ; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca about the manner of carrying up his sister \u2019s trunk , which he would manage all his own way ; and lastly , in walked Mr. Price himself , his own loud voice preceding him , as with something of the oath kind he kicked away his son \u2019s portmanteau and his daughter \u2019s bandbox in the passage , and called out for a candle ; no candle was brought , however , and he walked into the room . Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him , but sank down again on finding herself undistinguished in the dusk , and unthought of . With a friendly shake of his son \u2019s hand , and an eager voice , he instantly began\u2014\u201cHa ! welcome back , my boy . Glad to see you . Have you heard the news ? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning . Sharp is the word , you see ! By G \u2014 , you are just in time ! The doctor has been here inquiring for you : he has got one of the boats , and is to be off for Spithead by six , so you had better go with him . I have been to Turner \u2019s about your mess ; it is all in a way to be done . I should not wonder if you had your orders to - morrow : but you can not sail with this wind , if you are to cruise to the westward ; and Captain Walsh thinks you will certainly have a cruise to the westward , with the Elephant . By G \u2014 , I wish you may ! But old Scholey was saying , just now , that he thought you would be sent first to the Texel . Well , well , we are ready , whatever happens . But by G \u2014 , you lost a fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour ! I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds . Old Scholey ran in at breakfast - time , to say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out , I jumped up , and made but two steps to the platform . If ever there was a perfect beauty afloat , she is one ; and there she lays at Spithead , and anybody in England would take her for an eight - and - twenty . I was upon the platform two hours this afternoon looking at her . She lays close to the Endymion , between her and the Cleopatra , just to the eastward of the sheer hulk . \u201d \u201c Ha ! \u201d cried William , \u201c _ that \u2019s _ just where I should have put her myself . It \u2019s the best berth at Spithead . But here is my sister , sir ; here is Fanny , \u201d turning and leading her forward ; \u201c it is so dark you do not see her . \u201d With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her , Mr. Price now received his daughter ; and having given her a cordial hug , and observed that she was grown into a woman , and he supposed would be wanting a husband soon , seemed very much inclined to forget her again . Fanny shrunk back to her seat , with feelings sadly pained by his language and his smell of spirits ; and he talked on only to his son , and only of the Thrush , though William , warmly interested as he was in that subject , more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny , and her long absence and long journey . After sitting some time longer , a candle was obtained ; but as there was still no appearance of tea , nor , from Betsey \u2019s reports from the kitchen , much hope of any under a considerable period , William determined to go and change his dress , and make the necessary preparations for his removal on board directly , that he might have his tea in comfort afterwards . As he left the room , two rosy - faced boys , ragged and dirty , about eight and nine years old , rushed into it just released from school , and coming eagerly to see their sister , and tell that the Thrush was gone out of harbour ; Tom and Charles . Charles had been born since Fanny \u2019s going away , but Tom she had often helped to nurse , and now felt a particular pleasure in seeing again . Both were kissed very tenderly , but Tom she wanted to keep by her , to try to trace the features of the baby she had loved , and talked to , of his infant preference of herself . Tom , however , had no mind for such treatment : he came home not to stand and be talked to , but to run about and make a noise ; and both boys had soon burst from her , and slammed the parlour - door till her temples ached . She had now seen all that were at home ; there remained only two brothers between herself and Susan , one of whom was a clerk in a public office in London , and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman . But though she had _ seen _ all the members of the family , she had not yet _ heard _ all the noise they could make . Another quarter of an hour brought her a great deal more . William was soon calling out from the landing - place of the second story for his mother and for Rebecca . He was in distress for something that he had left there , and did not find again . A key was mislaid , Betsey accused of having got at his new hat , and some slight , but essential alteration of his uniform waistcoat , which he had been promised to have done for him , entirely neglected . Mrs. Price , Rebecca , and Betsey all went up to defend themselves , all talking together , but Rebecca loudest , and the job was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry ; William trying in vain to send Betsey down again , or keep her from being troublesome where she was ; the whole of which , as almost every door in the house was open , could be plainly distinguished in the parlour , except when drowned at intervals by the superior noise of Sam , Tom , and Charles chasing each other up and down stairs , and tumbling about and hallooing . Fanny was almost stunned . The smallness of the house and thinness of the walls brought everything so close to her , that , added to the fatigue of her journey , and all her recent agitation , she hardly knew how to bear it . _ Within _ the room all was tranquil enough , for Susan having disappeared with the others , there were soon only her father and herself remaining ; and he , taking out a newspaper , the accustomary loan of a neighbour , applied himself to studying it , without seeming to recollect her existence . The solitary candle was held between himself and the paper , without any reference to her possible convenience ; but she had nothing to do , and was glad to have the light screened from her aching head , as she sat in bewildered , broken , sorrowful contemplation . She was at home . But , alas ! it was not such a home , she had not such a welcome , as \u2014 she checked herself ; she was unreasonable . What right had she to be of importance to her family ? She could have none , so long lost sight of ! William \u2019s concerns must be dearest , they always had been , and he had every right . Yet to have so little said or asked about herself , to have scarcely an inquiry made after Mansfield ! It did pain her to have Mansfield forgotten ; the friends who had done so much \u2014 the dear , dear friends ! But here , one subject swallowed up all the rest . Perhaps it must be so . The destination of the Thrush must be now preeminently interesting . A day or two might shew the difference . _ She _ only was to blame . Yet she thought it would not have been so at Mansfield . No , in her uncle \u2019s house there would have been a consideration of times and seasons , a regulation of subject , a propriety , an attention towards everybody which there was not here . The only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly half an hour was from a sudden burst of her father \u2019s , not at all calculated to compose them . At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooing in the passage , he exclaimed , \u201c Devil take those young dogs ! How they are singing out ! Ay , Sam \u2019s voice louder than all the rest ! That boy is fit for a boatswain . Holla , you there ! Sam , stop your confounded pipe , or I shall be after you . \u201d This threat was so palpably disregarded , that though within five minutes afterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and sat down , Fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than their being for the time thoroughly fagged , which their hot faces and panting breaths seemed to prove , especially as they were still kicking each other \u2019s shins , and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately under their father \u2019s eye . The next opening of the door brought something more welcome : it was for the tea - things , which she had begun almost to despair of seeing that evening . Susan and an attendant girl , whose inferior appearance informed Fanny , to her great surprise , that she had previously seen the upper servant , brought in everything necessary for the meal ; Susan looking , as she put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister , as if divided between the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and usefulness , and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an office . \u201c She had been into the kitchen , \u201d she said , \u201c to hurry Sally and help make the toast , and spread the bread and butter , or she did not know when they should have got tea , and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey . \u201d Fanny was very thankful . She could not but own that she should be very glad of a little tea , and Susan immediately set about making it , as if pleased to have the employment all to herself ; and with only a little unnecessary bustle , and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her brothers in better order than she could , acquitted herself very well . Fanny \u2019s spirit was as much refreshed as her body ; her head and heart were soon the better for such well - timed kindness . Susan had an open , sensible countenance ; she was like William , and Fanny hoped to find her like him in disposition and goodwill towards herself . In this more placid state of things William reentered , followed not far behind by his mother and Betsey . He , complete in his lieutenant \u2019s uniform , looking and moving all the taller , firmer , and more graceful for it , and with the happiest smile over his face , walked up directly to Fanny , who , rising from her seat , looked at him for a moment in speechless admiration , and then threw her arms round his neck to sob out her various emotions of pain and pleasure . Anxious not to appear unhappy , she soon recovered herself ; and wiping away her tears , was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of his dress ; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of being on shore some part of every day before they sailed , and even of getting her to Spithead to see the sloop . The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell , the surgeon of the Thrush , a very well - behaved young man , who came to call for his friend , and for whom there was with some contrivance found a chair , and with some hasty washing of the young tea - maker \u2019s , a cup and saucer ; and after another quarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen , noise rising upon noise , and bustle upon bustle , men and boys at last all in motion together , the moment came for setting off ; everything was ready , William took leave , and all of them were gone ; for the three boys , in spite of their mother \u2019s entreaty , determined to see their brother and Mr. Campbell to the sally - port ; and Mr. Price walked off at the same time to carry back his neighbour \u2019s newspaper . Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for ; and accordingly , when Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea - things , and Mrs. Price had walked about the room some time looking for a shirt - sleeve , which Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the kitchen , the small party of females were pretty well composed , and the mother having lamented again over the impossibility of getting Sam ready in time , was at leisure to think of her eldest daughter and the friends she had come from . A few inquiries began : but one of the earliest\u2014\u201cHow did sister Bertram manage about her servants ? \u201d \u201c Was she as much plagued as herself to get tolerable servants?\u201d\u2014soon led her mind away from Northamptonshire , and fixed it on her own domestic grievances , and the shocking character of all the Portsmouth servants , of whom she believed her own two were the very worst , engrossed her completely . The Bertrams were all forgotten in detailing the faults of Rebecca , against whom Susan had also much to depose , and little Betsey a great deal more , and who did seem so thoroughly without a single recommendation , that Fanny could not help modestly presuming that her mother meant to part with her when her year was up . \u201c Her year ! \u201d cried Mrs. Price ; \u201c I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November . Servants are come to such a pass , my dear , in Portsmouth , that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year . I have no hope of ever being settled ; and if I was to part with Rebecca , I should only get something worse . And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please ; and I am sure the place is easy enough , for there is always a girl under her , and I often do half the work myself . \u201d Fanny was silent ; but not from being convinced that there might not be a remedy found for some of these evils . As she now sat looking at Betsey , she could not but think particularly of another sister , a very pretty little girl , whom she had left there not much younger when she went into Northamptonshire , who had died a few years afterwards . There had been something remarkably amiable about her . Fanny in those early days had preferred her to Susan ; and when the news of her death had at last reached Mansfield , had for a short time been quite afflicted . The sight of Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again , but she would not have pained her mother by alluding to her for the world . While considering her with these ideas , Betsey , at a small distance , was holding out something to catch her eyes , meaning to screen it at the same time from Susan \u2019s . \u201c What have you got there , my love ? \u201d said Fanny ; \u201c come and shew it to me . \u201d It was a silver knife . Up jumped Susan , claiming it as her own , and trying to get it away ; but the child ran to her mother \u2019s protection , and Susan could only reproach , which she did very warmly , and evidently hoping to interest Fanny on her side . \u201c It was very hard that she was not to have her _ own _ knife ; it was her own knife ; little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed , and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago . But mama kept it from her , and was always letting Betsey get hold of it ; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it , and get it for her own , though mama had _ promised _ her that Betsey should not have it in her own hands . \u201d Fanny was quite shocked . Every feeling of duty , honour , and tenderness was wounded by her sister \u2019s speech and her mother \u2019s reply . \u201c Now , Susan , \u201d cried Mrs. Price , in a complaining voice , \u201c now , how can you be so cross ? You are always quarrelling about that knife . I wish you would not be so quarrelsome . Poor little Betsey ; how cross Susan is to you ! But you should not have taken it out , my dear , when I sent you to the drawer . You know I told you not to touch it , because Susan is so cross about it . I must hide it another time , Betsey . Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep , only two hours before she died . Poor little soul ! she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , \u2018 Let sister Susan have my knife , mama , when I am dead and buried . \u2019 Poor little dear ! she was so fond of it , Fanny , that she would have it lay by her in bed , all through her illness . It was the gift of her good godmother , old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell , only six weeks before she was taken for death . Poor little sweet creature ! Well , she was taken away from evil to come . My own Betsey \u201d ( fondling her ) , \u201c _ you _ have not the luck of such a good godmother . Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people as you . \u201d Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris , but a message to say she hoped that her god - daughter was a good girl , and learnt her book . There had been at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing - room at Mansfield Park about sending her a prayer - book ; but no second sound had been heard of such a purpose . Mrs. Norris , however , had gone home and taken down two old prayer - books of her husband with that idea ; but , upon examination , the ardour of generosity went off . One was found to have too small a print for a child \u2019s eyes , and the other to be too cumbersome for her to carry about . Fanny , fatigued and fatigued again , was thankful to accept the first invitation of going to bed ; and before Betsey had finished her cry at being allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of sister , she was off , leaving all below in confusion and noise again ; the boys begging for toasted cheese , her father calling out for his rum and water , and Rebecca never where she ought to be . There was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined and scantily furnished chamber that she was to share with Susan . The smallness of the rooms above and below , indeed , and the narrowness of the passage and staircase , struck her beyond her imagination . She soon learned to think with respect of her own little attic at Mansfield Park , in _ that _ house reckoned too small for anybody \u2019s comfort .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [626,
