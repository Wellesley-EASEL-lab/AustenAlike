{"document": "XXVIII Her uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing - room when Fanny went down . To the former she was an interesting object , and he saw with pleasure the general elegance of her appearance , and her being in remarkably good looks . The neatness and propriety of her dress was all that he would allow himself to commend in her presence , but upon her leaving the room again soon afterwards , he spoke of her beauty with very decided praise . \u201c Yes , \u201d said Lady Bertram , \u201c she looks very well . I sent Chapman to her . \u201d \u201c Look well ! Oh , yes ! \u201d cried Mrs. Norris , \u201c she has good reason to look well with all her advantages : brought up in this family as she has been , with all the benefit of her cousins \u2019 manners before her . Only think , my dear Sir Thomas , what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of giving her . The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married . What would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand ? \u201d Sir Thomas said no more ; but when they sat down to table the eyes of the two young men assured him that the subject might be gently touched again , when the ladies withdrew , with more success . Fanny saw that she was approved ; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still better . From a variety of causes she was happy , and she was soon made still happier ; for in following her aunts out of the room , Edmund , who was holding open the door , said , as she passed him , \u201c You must dance with me , Fanny ; you must keep two dances for me ; any two that you like , except the first . \u201d She had nothing more to wish for . She had hardly ever been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her life . Her cousins \u2019 former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to her ; she felt it to be indeed very charming , and was actually practising her steps about the drawing - room as long as she could be safe from the notice of her aunt Norris , who was entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring the noble fire which the butler had prepared . Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid under any other circumstances , but Fanny \u2019s happiness still prevailed . It was but to think of her conversation with Edmund , and what was the restlessness of Mrs. Norris ? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram ? The gentlemen joined them ; and soon after began the sweet expectation of a carriage , when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed diffused , and they all stood about and talked and laughed , and every moment had its pleasure and its hope . Fanny felt that there must be a struggle in Edmund \u2019s cheerfulness , but it was delightful to see the effort so successfully made . When the carriages were really heard , when the guests began really to assemble , her own gaiety of heart was much subdued : the sight of so many strangers threw her back into herself ; and besides the gravity and formality of the first great circle , which the manners of neither Sir Thomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away , she found herself occasionally called on to endure something worse . She was introduced here and there by her uncle , and forced to be spoken to , and to curtsey , and speak again . This was a hard duty , and she was never summoned to it without looking at William , as he walked about at his ease in the background of the scene , and longing to be with him . The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch . The stiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and more diffused intimacies : little groups were formed , and everybody grew comfortable . Fanny felt the advantage ; and , drawing back from the toils of civility , would have been again most happy , could she have kept her eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford . _ She _ looked all loveliness \u2014 and what might not be the end of it ? Her own musings were brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her , and her thoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost instantly for the first two dances . Her happiness on this occasion was very much _ \u00e0 la mortal _ , finely chequered . To be secure of a partner at first was a most essential good \u2014 for the moment of beginning was now growing seriously near ; and she so little understood her own claims as to think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her , she must have been the last to be sought after , and should have received a partner only through a series of inquiry , and bustle , and interference , which would have been terrible ; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his manner of asking her which she did not like , and she saw his eye glancing for a moment at her necklace , with a smile \u2014 she thought there was a smile \u2014 which made her blush and feel wretched . And though there was no second glance to disturb her , though his object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable , she could not get the better of her embarrassment , heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it , and had no composure till he turned away to some one else . Then she could gradually rise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a partner , a voluntary partner , secured against the dancing began . When the company were moving into the ballroom , she found herself for the first time near Miss Crawford , whose eyes and smiles were immediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother \u2019s had been , and who was beginning to speak on the subject , when Fanny , anxious to get the story over , hastened to give the explanation of the second necklace : the real chain . Miss Crawford listened ; and all her intended compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten : she felt only one thing ; and her eyes , bright as they had been before , shewing they could yet be brighter , she exclaimed with eager pleasure , \u201c Did he ? Did Edmund ? That was like himself . No other man would have thought of it . I honour him beyond expression . \u201d And she looked around as if longing to tell him so . He was not near , he was attending a party of ladies out of the room ; and Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls , and taking an arm of each , they followed with the rest . Fanny \u2019s heart sunk , but there was no leisure for thinking long even of Miss Crawford \u2019s feelings . They were in the ballroom , the violins were playing , and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on anything serious . She must watch the general arrangements , and see how everything was done . In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her , and asked if she were engaged ; and the \u201c Yes , sir ; to Mr. Crawford , \u201d was exactly what he had intended to hear . Mr. Crawford was not far off ; Sir Thomas brought him to her , saying something which discovered to Fanny , that _ she _ was to lead the way and open the ball ; an idea that had never occurred to her before . Whenever she had thought of the minutiae of the evening , it had been as a matter of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford ; and the impression was so strong , that though _ her _ _ uncle _ spoke the contrary , she could not help an exclamation of surprise , a hint of her unfitness , an entreaty even to be excused . To be urging her opinion against Sir Thomas \u2019s was a proof of the extremity of the case ; but such was her horror at the first suggestion , that she could actually look him in the face and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise ; in vain , however : Sir Thomas smiled , tried to encourage her , and then looked too serious , and said too decidedly , \u201c It must be so , my dear , \u201d for her to hazard another word ; and she found herself the next moment conducted by Mr. Crawford to the top of the room , and standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers , couple after couple , as they were formed . She could hardly believe it . To be placed above so many elegant young women ! The distinction was too great . It was treating her like her cousins ! And her thoughts flew to those absent cousins with most unfeigned and truly tender regret , that they were not at home to take their own place in the room , and have their share of a pleasure which would have been so very delightful to them . So often as she had heard them wish for a ball at home as the greatest of all felicities ! And to have them away when it was given \u2014 and for _ her _ to be opening the ball \u2014 and with Mr. Crawford too ! She hoped they would not envy her that distinction _ now _ ; but when she looked back to the state of things in the autumn , to what they had all been to each other when once dancing in that house before , the present arrangement was almost more than she could understand herself . The ball began . It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny , for the first dance at least : her partner was in excellent spirits , and tried to impart them to her ; but she was a great deal too much frightened to have any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at . Young , pretty , and gentle , however , she had no awkwardnesses that were not as good as graces , and there were few persons present that were not disposed to praise her . She was attractive , she was modest , she was Sir Thomas \u2019s niece , and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford . It was enough to give her general favour . Sir Thomas himself was watching her progress down the dance with much complacency ; he was proud of his niece ; and without attributing all her personal beauty , as Mrs. Norris seemed to do , to her transplantation to Mansfield , he was pleased with himself for having supplied everything else : education and manners she owed to him . Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas \u2019s thoughts as he stood , and having , in spite of all his wrongs towards her , a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him , took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of Fanny . Her praise was warm , and he received it as she could wish , joining in it as far as discretion , and politeness , and slowness of speech would allow , and certainly appearing to greater advantage on the subject than his lady did soon afterwards , when Mary , perceiving her on a sofa very near , turned round before she began to dance , to compliment her on Miss Price \u2019s looks . \u201c Yes , she does look very well , \u201d was Lady Bertram \u2019s placid reply . \u201c Chapman helped her to dress . I sent Chapman to her . \u201d Not but that she was really pleased to have Fanny admired ; but she was so much more struck with her own kindness in sending Chapman to her , that she could not get it out of her head . Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _ her _ by commendation of Fanny ; to her , it was as the occasion offered\u2014\u201cAh ! ma\u2019am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! \u201d and Mrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had time for , amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up card - tables , giving hints to Sir Thomas , and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the room . Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her intentions to please . She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter , and filling her with sensations of delightful self - consequence ; and , misinterpreting Fanny \u2019s blushes , still thought she must be doing so when she went to her after the two first dances , and said , with a significant look , \u201c Perhaps _ you _ can tell me why my brother goes to town to - morrow ? He says he has business there , but will not tell me what . The first time he ever denied me his confidence ! But this is what we all come to . All are supplanted sooner or later . Now , I must apply to you for information . Pray , what is Henry going for ? \u201d Fanny protested her ignorance as steadily as her embarrassment allowed . \u201c Well , then , \u201d replied Miss Crawford , laughing , \u201c I must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother , and of talking of you by the way . \u201d Fanny was confused , but it was the confusion of discontent ; while Miss Crawford wondered she did not smile , and thought her over - anxious , or thought her odd , or thought her anything rather than insensible of pleasure in Henry \u2019s attentions . Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the course of the evening ; but Henry \u2019s attentions had very little to do with it . She would much rather _ not _ have been asked by him again so very soon , and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris , about the supper hour , were all for the sake of securing her at that part of the evening . But it was not to be avoided : he made her feel that she was the object of all ; though she could not say that it was unpleasantly done , that there was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner ; and sometimes , when he talked of William , he was really not unagreeable , and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit . But still his attentions made no part of her satisfaction . She was happy whenever she looked at William , and saw how perfectly he was enjoying himself , in every five minutes that she could walk about with him and hear his account of his partners ; she was happy in knowing herself admired ; and she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still to look forward to , during the greatest part of the evening , her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite engagement with _ him _ was in continual perspective . She was happy even when they did take place ; but not from any flow of spirits on his side , or any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning . His mind was fagged , and her happiness sprung from being the friend with whom it could find repose . \u201c I am worn out with civility , \u201d said he . \u201c I have been talking incessantly all night , and with nothing to say . But with _ you _ , Fanny , there may be peace . You will not want to be talked to . Let us have the luxury of silence . \u201d Fanny would hardly even speak her agreement . A weariness , arising probably , in great measure , from the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning , was peculiarly to be respected , and they went down their two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker - on that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son . The evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure . Miss Crawford had been in gay spirits when they first danced together , but it was not her gaiety that could do him good : it rather sank than raised his comfort ; and afterwards , for he found himself still impelled to seek her again , she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the profession to which he was now on the point of belonging . They had talked , and they had been silent ; he had reasoned , she had ridiculed ; and they had parted at last with mutual vexation . Fanny , not able to refrain entirely from observing them , had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied . It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering . Yet some happiness must and would arise from the very conviction that he did suffer . When her two dances with him were over , her inclination and strength for more were pretty well at an end ; and Sir Thomas , having seen her walk rather than dance down the shortening set , breathless , and with her hand at her side , gave his orders for her sitting down entirely . From that time Mr. Crawford sat down likewise . \u201c Poor Fanny ! \u201d cried William , coming for a moment to visit her , and working away his partner \u2019s fan as if for life , \u201c how soon she is knocked up ! Why , the sport is but just begun . I hope we shall keep it up these two hours . How can you be tired so soon ? \u201d \u201c So soon ! my good friend , \u201d said Sir Thomas , producing his watch with all necessary caution ; \u201c it is three o\u2019clock , and your sister is not used to these sort of hours . \u201d \u201c Well , then , Fanny , you shall not get up to - morrow before I go . Sleep as long as you can , and never mind me . \u201d \u201c Oh ! William . \u201d \u201c What ! Did she think of being up before you set off ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! yes , sir , \u201d cried Fanny , rising eagerly from her seat to be nearer her uncle ; \u201c I must get up and breakfast with him . It will be the last time , you know ; the last morning . \u201d \u201c You had better not . He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half - past nine . Mr. Crawford , I think you call for him at half - past nine ? \u201d Fanny was too urgent , however , and had too many tears in her eyes for denial ; and it ended in a gracious \u201c Well , well ! \u201d which was permission . \u201c Yes , half - past nine , \u201d said Crawford to William as the latter was leaving them , \u201c and I shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for _ me _ . \u201d And in a lower tone to Fanny , \u201c I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from . Your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to - morrow . \u201d After a short consideration , Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the early breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone : he should himself be of it ; and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted convinced him that the suspicions whence , he must confess to himself , this very ball had in great measure sprung , were well founded . Mr. Crawford was in love with Fanny . He had a pleasing anticipation of what would be . His niece , meanwhile , did not thank him for what he had just done . She had hoped to have William all to herself the last morning . It would have been an unspeakable indulgence . But though her wishes were overthrown , there was no spirit of murmuring within her . On the contrary , she was so totally unused to have her pleasure consulted , or to have anything take place at all in the way she could desire , that she was more disposed to wonder and rejoice in having carried her point so far , than to repine at the counteraction which followed . Shortly afterward , Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her inclination , by advising her to go immediately to bed . \u201c Advise \u201d was his word , but it was the advice of absolute power , and she had only to rise , and , with Mr. Crawford \u2019s very cordial adieus , pass quietly away ; stopping at the entrance - door , like the Lady of Branxholm Hall , \u201c one moment and no more , \u201d to view the happy scene , and take a last look at the five or six determined couple who were still hard at work ; and then , creeping slowly up the principal staircase , pursued by the ceaseless country - dance , feverish with hopes and fears , soup and negus , sore - footed and fatigued , restless and agitated , yet feeling , in spite of everything , that a ball was indeed delightful . In thus sending her away , Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking merely of her health . It might occur to him that Mr. Crawford had been sitting by her long enough , or he might mean to recommend her as a wife by shewing her persuadableness .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1,
