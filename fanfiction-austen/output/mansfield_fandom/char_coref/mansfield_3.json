{"document": "III The first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr. Norris , which happened when Fanny was about fifteen , and necessarily introduced alterations and novelties . Mrs. Norris , on quitting the Parsonage , removed first to the Park , and afterwards to a small house of Sir Thomas \u2019s in the village , and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him ; and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy . The living was hereafter for Edmund ; and , had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders . But Tom \u2019s extravagance had , previous to that event , been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation necessary , and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder . There was another family living actually held for Edmund ; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas \u2019s conscience , he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice , and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction , in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do . \u201c I blush for you , Tom , \u201d said he , in his most dignified manner ; \u201c I blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion . You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his . It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . \u201d Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow ; but escaping as quickly as possible , could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect , firstly , that he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends ; secondly , that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it ; and , thirdly , that the future incumbent , whoever he might be , would , in all probability , die very soon . On Mr. Norris \u2019s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant , who came consequently to reside at Mansfield ; and on proving to be a hearty man of forty - five , seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram \u2019s calculations . But \u201c no , he was a short - necked , apoplectic sort of fellow , and , plied well with good things , would soon pop off . \u201d He had a wife about fifteen years his junior , but no children ; and they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very respectable , agreeable people . The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister - in - law to claim her share in their niece , the change in Mrs. Norris \u2019s situation , and the improvement in Fanny \u2019s age , seeming not merely to do away any former objection to their living together , but even to give it the most decided eligibility ; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than heretofore , by some recent losses on his West India estate , in addition to his eldest son \u2019s extravagance , it became not undesirable to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support , and the obligation of her future provision . In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be , he mentioned its probability to his wife ; and the first time of the subject \u2019s occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present , she calmly observed to her , \u201c So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . How shall you like it ? \u201d Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt \u2019s words , \u201c Going to leave you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , my dear ; why should you be astonished ? You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died . But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same . \u201d The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected . She had never received kindness from her aunt Norris , and could not love her . \u201c I shall be very sorry to go away , \u201d said she , with a faltering voice . \u201c Yes , I dare say you will ; _ that \u2019s _ natural enough . I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world . \u201d \u201c I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , \u201d said Fanny modestly . \u201c No , my dear ; I hope not . I have always found you a very good girl . \u201d \u201c And am I never to live here again ? \u201d \u201c Never , my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home . It can make very little difference to you , whether you are in one house or the other . \u201d Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart ; she could not feel the difference to be so small , she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction . As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress . \u201c Cousin , \u201d said she , \u201c something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now . I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! \u201d \u201c Yes ; my aunt Bertram has just told me so . It is quite settled . I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there . \u201d \u201c Well , Fanny , and if the plan were not unpleasant to you , I should call it an excellent one . \u201d \u201c Oh , cousin ! \u201d \u201c It has everything else in its favour . My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you . She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere . You will be what you ought to be to her . I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? \u201d \u201c Indeed it does : I can not like it . I love this house and everything in it : I shall love nothing there . You know how uncomfortable I feel with her . \u201d \u201c I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so . She never knew how to be pleasant to children . But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her . \u201d \u201c I can never be important to any one . \u201d \u201c What is to prevent you ? \u201d \u201c Everything . My situation , my foolishness and awkwardness . \u201d \u201c As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly . There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known . You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it . I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion . \u201d \u201c You are too kind , \u201d said Fanny , colouring at such praise ; \u201c how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . Oh ! cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . \u201d \u201c Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House . You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park ; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever . The two families will be meeting every day in the year . The only difference will be that , living with your aunt , you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be . _ Here _ there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with _ her _ you will be forced to speak for yourself . \u201d \u201c Oh ! do not say so . \u201d \u201c I must say it , and say it with pleasure . Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now . She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . \u201d Fanny sighed , and said , \u201c I can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself , and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be . If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me , it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody . _ Here _ , I know , I am of none , and yet I love the place so well . \u201d \u201c The place , Fanny , is what you will not quit , though you quit the house . You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever . Even _ your _ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change . You will have the same walks to frequent , the same library to choose from , the same people to look at , the same horse to ride . \u201d \u201c Very true . Yes , dear old grey pony ! Ah ! cousin , when I remember how much I used to dread riding , what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good ( oh ! how I have trembled at my uncle \u2019s opening his lips if horses were talked of ) , and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears , and convince me that I should like it after a little while , and feel how right you proved to be , I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well . \u201d \u201c And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too . \u201d So ended their discourse , which , for any very appropriate service it could render Fanny , might as well have been spared , for Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her . It had never occurred to her , on the present occasion , but as a thing to be carefully avoided . To prevent its being expected , she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish , the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her servants , and allow a spare room for a friend , of which she made a very particular point . The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been wanted , but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now never forgotten . Not all her precautions , however , could save her from being suspected of something better ; or , perhaps , her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny . Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris \u2014 \u201c I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . \u201d Mrs. Norris almost started . \u201c Live with me , dear Lady Bertram ! what do you mean ? \u201d \u201c Is she not to live with you ? I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas . \u201d \u201c Me ! never . I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me . Fanny live with me ! the last thing in the world for me to think of , or for anybody to wish that really knows us both . Good heaven ! what could I do with Fanny ? Me ! a poor , helpless , forlorn widow , unfit for anything , my spirits quite broke down ; what could I do with a girl at her time of life ? A girl of fifteen ! the very age of all others to need most attention and care , and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test ! Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing ! Sir Thomas is too much my friend . Nobody that wishes me well , I am sure , would propose it . How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it ? \u201d \u201c Indeed , I do not know . I suppose he thought it best . \u201d \u201c But what did he say ? He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny . I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it . \u201d \u201c No ; he only said he thought it very likely ; and I thought so too . We both thought it would be a comfort to you . But if you do not like it , there is no more to be said . She is no encumbrance here . \u201d \u201c Dear sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ? Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed \u2014 what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ? If I could wish it for my own sake , I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl . She is in good hands , and sure of doing well . I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can . \u201d \u201c Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone ? \u201d \u201c Lady Bertram , I do not complain . I know I can not live as I have done , but I must retrench where I can , and learn to be a better manager . I _ have _ _ been _ a liberal housekeeper enough , but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now . My situation is as much altered as my income . A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris , as clergyman of the parish , that can not be expected from me . It is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers . At the White House , matters must be better looked after . I _ must _ live within my income , or I shall be miserable ; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more , to lay by a little at the end of the year . \u201d \u201c I dare say you will . You always do , do n\u2019t you ? \u201d \u201c My object , Lady Bertram , is to be of use to those that come after me . It is for your children \u2019s good that I wish to be richer . I have nobody else to care for , but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having . \u201d \u201c You are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them . They are sure of being well provided for . Sir Thomas will take care of that . \u201d \u201c Why , you know , Sir Thomas \u2019s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns . \u201d \u201c Oh ! _ that _ will soon be settled . Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know . \u201d \u201c Well , Lady Bertram , \u201d said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , \u201c I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ; besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend . \u201d Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken his sister - in - law \u2019s views ; and she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation , or the slightest allusion to it from him . He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her . Mrs. Norris took possession of the White House , the Grants arrived at the Parsonage , and these events over , everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual . The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable , gave great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance . They had their faults , and Mrs. Norris soon found them out . The Doctor was very fond of eating , and would have a good dinner every day ; and Mrs. Grant , instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense , gave her cook as high wages as they did at Mansfield Park , and was scarcely ever seen in her offices . Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances , nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed in the house . \u201c Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself ; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in _ her _ _ time _ , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand . A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place . _ Her _ store - room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into . Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds . \u201d Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective . She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist , but she felt all the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant \u2019s being so well settled in life without being handsome , and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often , though not so diffusely , as Mrs. Norris discussed the other . These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies . Sir Thomas found it expedient to go to Antigua himself , for the better arrangement of his affairs , and he took his eldest son with him , in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions at home . They left England with the probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent . The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light , and the hope of its utility to his son , reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the rest of his family , and of leaving his daughters to the direction of others at their present most interesting time of life . He could not think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them , or rather , to perform what should have been her own ; but , in Mrs. Norris \u2019s watchful attention , and in Edmund \u2019s judgment , he had sufficient confidence to make him go without fears for their conduct . Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her ; but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety , or solicitude for his comfort , being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous , or difficult , or fatiguing to anybody but themselves . The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion : not for their sorrow , but for their want of it . Their father was no object of love to them ; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures , and his absence was unhappily most welcome . They were relieved by it from all restraint ; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been forbidden by Sir Thomas , they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal , and to have every indulgence within their reach . Fanny \u2019s relief , and her consciousness of it , were quite equal to her cousins \u2019 ; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful , and she really grieved because she could not grieve . \u201c Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear ! it was a shameful insensibility . \u201d He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . \u201c This was so thoughtful and kind ! \u201d and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her \u201c my dear Fanny , \u201d while he said it , every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten . But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , \u201c If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . \u201d She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone ; and her cousins , on seeing her with red eyes , set her down as a hypocrite .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [14, 16],
