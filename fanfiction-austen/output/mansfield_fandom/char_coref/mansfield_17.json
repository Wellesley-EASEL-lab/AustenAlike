{"document": "XVII It was , indeed , a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria . Such a victory over Edmund \u2019s discretion had been beyond their hopes , and was most delightful . There was no longer anything to disturb them in their darling project , and they congratulated each other in private on the jealous weakness to which they attributed the change , with all the glee of feelings gratified in every way . Edmund might still look grave , and say he did not like the scheme in general , and must disapprove the play in particular ; their point was gained : he was to act , and he was driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only . Edmund had descended from that moral elevation which he had maintained before , and they were both as much the better as the happier for the descent . They behaved very well , however , to _ him _ on the occasion , betraying no exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth , and seemed to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles Maddox , as if they had been forced into admitting him against their inclination . \u201c To have it quite in their own family circle was what they had particularly wished . A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort \u201d ; and when Edmund , pursuing that idea , gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience , they were ready , in the complaisance of the moment , to promise anything . It was all good - humour and encouragement . Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his dress , Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt \u2019s last scene with the Baron admitted a good deal of action and emphasis , and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his speeches . \u201c Perhaps , \u201d said Tom , \u201c Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now . Perhaps you may persuade _ her _ . \u201d \u201c No , she is quite determined . She certainly will not act . \u201d \u201c Oh ! very well . \u201d And not another word was said ; but Fanny felt herself again in danger , and her indifference to the danger was beginning to fail her already . There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this change in Edmund ; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers , and entered with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole affair as could have but one effect on him . \u201c He was certainly right in respecting such feelings ; he was glad he had determined on it . \u201d And the morning wore away in satisfactions very sweet , if not very sound . One advantage resulted from it to Fanny : at the earnest request of Miss Crawford , Mrs. Grant had , with her usual good - humour , agreed to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted ; and this was all that occurred to gladden _ her _ heart during the day ; and even this , when imparted by Edmund , brought a pang with it , for it was Miss Crawford to whom she was obliged \u2014 it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to excite her gratitude , and whose merit in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration . She was safe ; but peace and safety were unconnected here . Her mind had been never farther from peace . She could not feel that she had done wrong herself , but she was disquieted in every other way . Her heart and her judgment were equally against Edmund \u2019s decision : she could not acquit his unsteadiness , and his happiness under it made her wretched . She was full of jealousy and agitation . Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an insult , with friendly expressions towards herself which she could hardly answer calmly . Everybody around her was gay and busy , prosperous and important ; each had their object of interest , their part , their dress , their favourite scene , their friends and confederates : all were finding employment in consultations and comparisons , or diversion in the playful conceits they suggested . She alone was sad and insignificant : she had no share in anything ; she might go or stay ; she might be in the midst of their noise , or retreat from it to the solitude of the East room , without being seen or missed . She could almost think anything would have been preferable to this . Mrs. Grant was of consequence : _ her _ good - nature had honourable mention ; her taste and her time were considered ; her presence was wanted ; she was sought for , and attended , and praised ; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted . But reflection brought better feelings , and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect , which could never have belonged to _ her _ ; and that , had she received even the greatest , she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which , considering only her uncle , she must condemn altogether . Fanny \u2019s heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them , as she soon began to acknowledge to herself . Julia was a sufferer too , though not quite so blamelessly . Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings ; but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions , with a jealousy of her sister so reasonable as ought to have been their cure ; and now that the conviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her , she submitted to it without any alarm for Maria \u2019s situation , or any endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself . She either sat in gloomy silence , wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue , no curiosity touch , no wit amuse ; or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates , was talking with forced gaiety to him alone , and ridiculing the acting of the others . For a day or two after the affront was given , Henry Crawford had endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment , but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a few repulses ; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one flirtation , he grew indifferent to the quarrel , or rather thought it a lucky occurrence , as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant . She was not pleased to see Julia excluded from the play , and sitting by disregarded ; but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness , as Henry must be the best judge of his own , and as he did assure her , with a most persuasive smile , that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each other , she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister , entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there , and then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general , and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her . \u201c I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , \u201d was her observation to Mary . \u201c I dare say she is , \u201d replied Mary coldly . \u201c I imagine both sisters are . \u201d \u201c Both ! no , no , that must not be . Do not give him a hint of it . Think of Mr. Rushworth ! \u201d \u201c You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth . It may do _ her _ some good . I often think of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s property and independence , and wish them in other hands ; but I never think of him . A man might represent the county with such an estate ; a man might escape a profession and represent the county . \u201d \u201c I dare say he _ will _ be in parliament soon . When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet . \u201d \u201c Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , \u201d said Mary , after a pause . \u201c Do you remember Hawkins Browne \u2019s \u2018 Address to Tobacco , \u2019 in imitation of Pope ? \u2014 Blest leaf ! whose aromatic gales dispense To Templars modesty , to Parsons sense . I will parody them \u2014 Blest Knight ! whose dictatorial looks dispense To Children affluence , to Rushworth sense . Will not that do , Mrs. Grant ? Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas \u2019s return . \u201d \u201c You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you . I do not think we do so well without him . He has a fine dignified manner , which suits the head of such a house , and keeps everybody in their place . Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order . But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry . I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends , I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . \u201d \u201c I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth \u2019s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . \u201d \u201c If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . \u201d Julia _ did _ suffer , however , though Mrs. Grant discerned it not , and though it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise . She had loved , she did love still , and she had all the suffering which a warm temper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment of a dear , though irrational hope , with a strong sense of ill - usage . Her heart was sore and angry , and she was capable only of angry consolations . The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy : they were alienated from each other ; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there , some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth . With no material fault of temper , or difference of opinion , to prevent their being very good friends while their interests were the same , the sisters , under such a trial as this , had not affection or principle enough to make them merciful or just , to give them honour or compassion . Maria felt her triumph , and pursued her purpose , careless of Julia ; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawford without trusting that it would create jealousy , and bring a public disturbance at last . Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia ; but there was no outward fellowship between them . Julia made no communication , and Fanny took no liberties . They were two solitary sufferers , or connected only by Fanny \u2019s consciousness . The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia \u2019s discomposure , and their blindness to its true cause , must be imputed to the fullness of their own minds . They were totally preoccupied . Tom was engrossed by the concerns of his theatre , and saw nothing that did not immediately relate to it . Edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between Miss Crawford \u2019s claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company , superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her , and saving , with delighted integrity , half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas , to have leisure for watching the behaviour , or guarding the happiness of his daughters .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position":
