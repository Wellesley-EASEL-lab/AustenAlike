{"document": "XXVI William \u2019s desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary impression on his uncle . The hope of an opportunity , which Sir Thomas had then given , was not given to be thought of no more . He remained steadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling ; to gratify anybody else who might wish to see Fanny dance , and to give pleasure to the young people in general ; and having thought the matter over , and taken his resolution in quiet independence , the result of it appeared the next morning at breakfast , when , after recalling and commending what his nephew had said , he added , \u201c I do not like , William , that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence . It would give me pleasure to see you both dance . You spoke of the balls at Northampton . Your cousins have occasionally attended them ; but they would not altogether suit us now . The fatigue would be too much for your aunt . I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball . A dance at home would be more eligible ; and if \u2014 \u201d \u201c Ah , my dear Sir Thomas ! \u201d interrupted Mrs. Norris , \u201c I knew what was coming . I knew what you were going to say . If dear Julia were at home , or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton , to afford a reason , an occasion for such a thing , you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield . I know you would . If _ they _ were at home to grace the ball , a ball you would have this very Christmas . Thank your uncle , William , thank your uncle ! \u201d \u201c My daughters , \u201d replied Sir Thomas , gravely interposing , \u201c have their pleasures at Brighton , and I hope are very happy ; but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins . Could we be all assembled , our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete , but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement . \u201d Mrs. Norris had not another word to say . She saw decision in his looks , and her surprise and vexation required some minutes \u2019 silence to be settled into composure . A ball at such a time ! His daughters absent and herself not consulted ! There was comfort , however , soon at hand . _ She _ must be the doer of everything : Lady Bertram would of course be spared all thought and exertion , and it would all fall upon _ her _ . She should have to do the honours of the evening ; and this reflection quickly restored so much of her good - humour as enabled her to join in with the others , before their happiness and thanks were all expressed . Edmund , William , and Fanny did , in their different ways , look and speak as much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could desire . Edmund \u2019s feelings were for the other two . His father had never conferred a favour or shewn a kindness more to his satisfaction . Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented , and had no objections to make . Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little trouble ; and she assured him \u201c that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . \u201d Mrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he would think fittest to be used , but found it all prearranged ; and when she would have conjectured and hinted about the day , it appeared that the day was settled too . Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a very complete outline of the business ; and as soon as she would listen quietly , could read his list of the families to be invited , from whom he calculated , with all necessary allowance for the shortness of the notice , to collect young people enough to form twelve or fourteen couple : and could detail the considerations which had induced him to fix on the 22nd as the most eligible day . William was required to be at Portsmouth on the 24th ; the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his visit ; but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any earlier . Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the same , and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself , as by far the best day for the purpose . The ball was now a settled thing , and before the evening a proclaimed thing to all whom it concerned . Invitations were sent with despatch , and many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of happy cares as well as Fanny . To her the cares were sometimes almost beyond the happiness ; for young and inexperienced , with small means of choice and no confidence in her own taste , the \u201c how she should be dressed \u201d was a point of painful solicitude ; and the almost solitary ornament in her possession , a very pretty amber cross which William had brought her from Sicily , was the greatest distress of all , for she had nothing but a bit of ribbon to fasten it to ; and though she had worn it in that manner once , would it be allowable at such a time in the midst of all the rich ornaments which she supposed all the other young ladies would appear in ? And yet not to wear it ! William had wanted to buy her a gold chain too , but the purchase had been beyond his means , and therefore not to wear the cross might be mortifying him . These were anxious considerations ; enough to sober her spirits even under the prospect of a ball given principally for her gratification . The preparations meanwhile went on , and Lady Bertram continued to sit on her sofa without any inconvenience from them . She had some extra visits from the housekeeper , and her maid was rather hurried in making up a new dress for her : Sir Thomas gave orders , and Mrs. Norris ran about ; but all this gave _ her _ no trouble , and as she had foreseen , \u201c there was , in fact , no trouble in the business . \u201d Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares : his mind being deeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at hand , which were to fix his fate in life \u2014 ordination and matrimony \u2014 events of such a serious character as to make the ball , which would be very quickly followed by one of them , appear of less moment in his eyes than in those of any other person in the house . On the 23rd he was going to a friend near Peterborough , in the same situation as himself , and they were to receive ordination in the course of the Christmas week . Half his destiny would then be determined , but the other half might not be so very smoothly wooed . His duties would be established , but the wife who was to share , and animate , and reward those duties , might yet be unattainable . He knew his own mind , but he was not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford \u2019s . There were points on which they did not quite agree ; there were moments in which she did not seem propitious ; and though trusting altogether to her affection , so far as to be resolved \u2014 almost resolved \u2014 on bringing it to a decision within a very short time , as soon as the variety of business before him were arranged , and he knew what he had to offer her , he had many anxious feelings , many doubting hours as to the result . His conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong ; he could look back on a long course of encouragement , and she was as perfect in disinterested attachment as in everything else . But at other times doubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes ; and when he thought of her acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement , her decided preference of a London life , what could he expect but a determined rejection ? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated , demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as conscience must forbid . The issue of all depended on one question . Did she love him well enough to forego what had used to be essential points ? Did she love him well enough to make them no longer essential ? And this question , which he was continually repeating to himself , though oftenest answered with a \u201c Yes , \u201d had sometimes its \u201c No . \u201d Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield , and on this circumstance the \u201c no \u201d and the \u201c yes \u201d had been very recently in alternation . He had seen her eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend \u2019s letter , which claimed a long visit from her in London , and of the kindness of Henry , in engaging to remain where he was till January , that he might convey her thither ; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey with an animation which had \u201c no \u201d in every tone . But this had occurred on the first day of its being settled , within the first hour of the burst of such enjoyment , when nothing but the friends she was to visit was before her . He had since heard her express herself differently , with other feelings , more chequered feelings : he had heard her tell Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret ; that she began to believe neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were worth those she left behind ; and that though she felt she must go , and knew she should enjoy herself when once away , she was already looking forward to being at Mansfield again . Was there not a \u201c yes \u201d in all this ? With such matters to ponder over , and arrange , and re - arrange , Edmund could not , on his own account , think very much of the evening which the rest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of strong interest . Independent of his two cousins \u2019 enjoyment in it , the evening was to him of no higher value than any other appointed meeting of the two families might be . In every meeting there was a hope of receiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford \u2019s attachment ; but the whirl of a ballroom , perhaps , was not particularly favourable to the excitement or expression of serious feelings . To engage her early for the two first dances was all the command of individual happiness which he felt in his power , and the only preparation for the ball which he could enter into , in spite of all that was passing around him on the subject , from morning till night . Thursday was the day of the ball ; and on Wednesday morning Fanny , still unable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear , determined to seek the counsel of the more enlightened , and apply to Mrs. Grant and her sister , whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless ; and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton , and she had reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out , she walked down to the Parsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion ; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to Fanny , being more than half - ashamed of her own solicitude . She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage , just setting out to call on her , and as it seemed to her that her friend , though obliged to insist on turning back , was unwilling to lose her walk , she explained her business at once , and observed , that if she would be so kind as to give her opinion , it might be all talked over as well without doors as within . Miss Crawford appeared gratified by the application , and after a moment \u2019s thought , urged Fanny \u2019s returning with her in a much more cordial manner than before , and proposed their going up into her room , where they might have a comfortable coze , without disturbing Dr. and Mrs. Grant , who were together in the drawing - room . It was just the plan to suit Fanny ; and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready and kind attention , they proceeded indoors , and upstairs , and were soon deep in the interesting subject . Miss Crawford , pleased with the appeal , gave her all her best judgment and taste , made everything easy by her suggestions , and tried to make everything agreeable by her encouragement . The dress being settled in all its grander parts\u2014\u201cBut what shall you have by way of necklace ? \u201d said Miss Crawford . \u201c Shall not you wear your brother \u2019s cross ? \u201d And as she spoke she was undoing a small parcel , which Fanny had observed in her hand when they met . Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on this point : she did not know how either to wear the cross , or to refrain from wearing it . She was answered by having a small trinket - box placed before her , and being requested to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces . Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford was provided , and such the object of her intended visit : and in the kindest manner she now urged Fanny \u2019s taking one for the cross and to keep for her sake , saying everything she could think of to obviate the scruples which were making Fanny start back at first with a look of horror at the proposal . \u201c You see what a collection I have , \u201d said she ; \u201c more by half than I ever use or think of . I do not offer them as new . I offer nothing but an old necklace . You must forgive the liberty , and oblige me . \u201d Fanny still resisted , and from her heart . The gift was too valuable . But Miss Crawford persevered , and argued the case with so much affectionate earnestness through all the heads of William and the cross , and the ball , and herself , as to be finally successful . Fanny found herself obliged to yield , that she might not be accused of pride or indifference , or some other littleness ; and having with modest reluctance given her consent , proceeded to make the selection . She looked and looked , longing to know which might be least valuable ; and was determined in her choice at last , by fancying there was one necklace more frequently placed before her eyes than the rest . It was of gold , prettily worked ; and though Fanny would have preferred a longer and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose , she hoped , in fixing on this , to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep . Miss Crawford smiled her perfect approbation ; and hastened to complete the gift by putting the necklace round her , and making her see how well it looked . Fanny had not a word to say against its becomingness , and , excepting what remained of her scruples , was exceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos . She would rather , perhaps , have been obliged to some other person . But this was an unworthy feeling . Miss Crawford had anticipated her wants with a kindness which proved her a real friend . \u201c When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you , \u201d said she , \u201c and feel how very kind you were . \u201d \u201c You must think of somebody else too , when you wear that necklace , \u201d replied Miss Crawford . \u201c You must think of Henry , for it was his choice in the first place . He gave it to me , and with the necklace I make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver . It is to be a family remembrancer . The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too . \u201d Fanny , in great astonishment and confusion , would have returned the present instantly . To take what had been the gift of another person , of a brother too , impossible ! it must not be ! and with an eagerness and embarrassment quite diverting to her companion , she laid down the necklace again on its cotton , and seemed resolved either to take another or none at all . Miss Crawford thought she had never seen a prettier consciousness . \u201c My dear child , \u201d said she , laughing , \u201c what are you afraid of ? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine , and fancy you did not come honestly by it ? or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago , before he knew there was such a throat in the world ? or perhaps\u201d\u2014looking archly\u2014\u201cyou suspect a confederacy between us , and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire ? \u201d With the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought . \u201c Well , then , \u201d replied Miss Crawford more seriously , but without at all believing her , \u201c to convince me that you suspect no trick , and are as unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you , take the necklace and say no more about it . Its being a gift of my brother \u2019s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it , as I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it . He is always giving me something or other . I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half . And as for this necklace , I do not suppose I have worn it six times : it is very pretty , but I never think of it ; and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket - box , you have happened to fix on the very one which , if I have a choice , I would rather part with and see in your possession than any other . Say no more against it , I entreat you . Such a trifle is not worth half so many words . \u201d Fanny dared not make any farther opposition ; and with renewed but less happy thanks accepted the necklace again , for there was an expression in Miss Crawford \u2019s eyes which she could not be satisfied with . It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford \u2019s change of manners . She had long seen it . He evidently tried to please her : he was gallant , he was attentive , he was something like what he had been to her cousins : he wanted , she supposed , to cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them ; and whether he might not have some concern in this necklace \u2014 she could not be convinced that he had not , for Miss Crawford , complaisant as a sister , was careless as a woman and a friend . Reflecting and doubting , and feeling that the possession of what she had so much wished for did not bring much satisfaction , she now walked home again , with a change rather than a diminution of cares since her treading that path before .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "William"}, {"position": [15, 16], "text": "his"}, {"position": [108, 110], "text": "his nephew"},
