{"document": "II The little girl performed her long journey in safety ; and at Northampton was met by Mrs. Norris , who thus regaled in the credit of being foremost to welcome her , and in the importance of leading her in to the others , and recommending her to their kindness . Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old , and though there might not be much in her first appearance to captivate , there was , at least , nothing to disgust her relations . She was small of her age , with no glow of complexion , nor any other striking beauty ; exceedingly timid and shy , and shrinking from notice ; but her air , though awkward , was not vulgar , her voice was sweet , and when she spoke her countenance was pretty . Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly ; and Sir Thomas , seeing how much she needed encouragement , tried to be all that was conciliating : but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment ; and Lady Bertram , without taking half so much trouble , or speaking one word where he spoke ten , by the mere aid of a good - humoured smile , became immediately the less awful character of the two . The young people were all at home , and sustained their share in the introduction very well , with much good humour , and no embarrassment , at least on the part of the sons , who , at seventeen and sixteen , and tall of their age , had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little cousin . The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in greater awe of their father , who addressed them on the occasion with rather an injudicious particularity . But they were too much used to company and praise to have anything like natural shyness ; and their confidence increasing from their cousin \u2019s total want of it , they were soon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy indifference . They were a remarkably fine family , the sons very well - looking , the daughters decidedly handsome , and all of them well - grown and forward of their age , which produced as striking a difference between the cousins in person , as education had given to their address ; and no one would have supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were . There were in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny . Julia Bertram was only twelve , and Maria but a year older . The little visitor meanwhile was as unhappy as possible . Afraid of everybody , ashamed of herself , and longing for the home she had left , she knew not how to look up , and could scarcely speak to be heard , or without crying . Mrs. Norris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her wonderful good fortune , and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behaviour which it ought to produce , and her consciousness of misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her not to be happy . The fatigue , too , of so long a journey , became soon no trifling evil . In vain were the well - meant condescensions of Sir Thomas , and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl ; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug , and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort ; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her , and sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend , she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed . \u201c This is not a very promising beginning , \u201d said Mrs. Norris , when Fanny had left the room . \u201c After all that I said to her as we came along , I thought she would have behaved better ; I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first . I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper \u2014 her poor mother had a good deal ; but we must make allowances for such a child \u2014 and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her , for , with all its faults , it _ was _ her home , and she can not as yet understand how much she has changed for the better ; but then there is moderation in all things . \u201d It required a longer time , however , than Mrs. Norris was inclined to allow , to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park , and the separation from everybody she had been used to . Her feelings were very acute , and too little understood to be properly attended to . Nobody meant to be unkind , but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure her comfort . The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day , on purpose to afford leisure for getting acquainted with , and entertaining their young cousin , produced little union . They could not but hold her cheap on finding that she had but two sashes , and had never learned French ; and when they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were so good as to play , they could do no more than make her a generous present of some of their least valued toys , and leave her to herself , while they adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport of the moment , making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper . Fanny , whether near or from her cousins , whether in the schoolroom , the drawing - room , or the shrubbery , was equally forlorn , finding something to fear in every person and place . She was disheartened by Lady Bertram \u2019s silence , awed by Sir Thomas \u2019s grave looks , and quite overcome by Mrs. Norris \u2019s admonitions . Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size , and abashed her by noticing her shyness : Miss Lee wondered at her ignorance , and the maid - servants sneered at her clothes ; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers and sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow , instructress , and nurse , the despondence that sunk her little heart was severe . The grandeur of the house astonished , but could not console her . The rooms were too large for her to move in with ease : whatever she touched she expected to injure , and she crept about in constant terror of something or other ; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry ; and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing - room when she left it at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune , ended every day \u2019s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep . A week had passed in this way , and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner , when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund , the youngest of the sons , sitting crying on the attic stairs . \u201c My dear little cousin , \u201d said he , with all the gentleness of an excellent nature , \u201c what can be the matter ? \u201d And sitting down by her , he was at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised , and persuade her to speak openly . Was she ill ? or was anybody angry with her ? or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia ? or was she puzzled about anything in her lesson that he could explain ? Did she , in short , want anything he could possibly get her , or do for her ? For a long while no answer could be obtained beyond a \u201c no , no \u2014 not at all \u2014 no , thank you \u201d ; but he still persevered ; and no sooner had he begun to revert to her own home , than her increased sobs explained to him where the grievance lay . He tried to console her . \u201c You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , \u201d said he , \u201c which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . Let us walk out in the park , and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters . \u201d On pursuing the subject , he found that , dear as all these brothers and sisters generally were , there was one among them who ran more in her thoughts than the rest . It was William whom she talked of most , and wanted most to see . William , the eldest , a year older than herself , her constant companion and friend ; her advocate with her mother ( of whom he was the darling ) in every distress . \u201c William did not like she should come away ; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed . \u201d \u201c But William will write to you , I dare say . \u201d \u201c Yes , he had promised he would , but he had told _ her _ to write first . \u201d \u201c And when shall you do it ? \u201d She hung her head and answered hesitatingly , \u201c she did not know ; she had not any paper . \u201d \u201c If that be all your difficulty , I will furnish you with paper and every other material , and you may write your letter whenever you choose . Would it make you happy to write to William ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very . \u201d \u201c Then let it be done now . Come with me into the breakfast - room , we shall find everything there , and be sure of having the room to ourselves . \u201d \u201c But , cousin , will it go to the post ? \u201d \u201c Yes , depend upon me it shall : it shall go with the other letters ; and , as your uncle will frank it , it will cost William nothing . \u201d \u201c My uncle ! \u201d repeated Fanny , with a frightened look . \u201c Yes , when you have written the letter , I will take it to my father to frank . \u201d Fanny thought it a bold measure , but offered no further resistance ; and they went together into the breakfast - room , where Edmund prepared her paper , and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could himself have felt , and probably with somewhat more exactness . He continued with her the whole time of her writing , to assist her with his penknife or his orthography , as either were wanted ; and added to these attentions , which she felt very much , a kindness to her brother which delighted her beyond all the rest . He wrote with his own hand his love to his cousin William , and sent him half a guinea under the seal . Fanny \u2019s feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing ; but her countenance and a few artless words fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight , and her cousin began to find her an interesting object . He talked to her more , and , from all that she said , was convinced of her having an affectionate heart , and a strong desire of doing right ; and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation , and great timidity . He had never knowingly given her pain , but he now felt that she required more positive kindness ; and with that view endeavoured , in the first place , to lessen her fears of them all , and gave her especially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and Julia , and being as merry as possible . From this day Fanny grew more comfortable . She felt that she had a friend , and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits with everybody else . The place became less strange , and the people less formidable ; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not cease to fear , she began at least to know their ways , and to catch the best manner of conforming to them . The little rusticities and awkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all , and not least of herself , necessarily wore away , and she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle , nor did her aunt Norris \u2019s voice make her start very much . To her cousins she became occasionally an acceptable companion . Though unworthy , from inferiority of age and strength , to be their constant associate , their pleasures and schemes were sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful , especially when that third was of an obliging , yielding temper ; and they could not but own , when their aunt inquired into her faults , or their brother Edmund urged her claims to their kindness , that \u201c Fanny was good - natured enough . \u201d Edmund was uniformly kind himself ; and she had nothing worse to endure on the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten . He was just entering into life , full of spirits , and with all the liberal dispositions of an eldest son , who feels born only for expense and enjoyment . His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his situation and rights : he made her some very pretty presents , and laughed at her . As her appearance and spirits improved , Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan ; and it was pretty soon decided between them that , though far from clever , she showed a tractable disposition , and seemed likely to give them little trouble . A mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _ them _ . Fanny could read , work , and write , but she had been taught nothing more ; and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar , they thought her prodigiously stupid , and for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawing - room . \u201c Dear mama , only think , my cousin can not put the map of Europe together \u2014 or my cousin can not tell the principal rivers in Russia \u2014 or , she never heard of Asia Minor \u2014 or she does not know the difference between water - colours and crayons!\u2014How strange!\u2014Did you ever hear anything so stupid ? \u201d \u201c My dear , \u201d their considerate aunt would reply , \u201c it is very bad , but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself . \u201d \u201c But , aunt , she is really so very ignorant!\u2014Do you know , we asked her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland ; and she said , she should cross to the Isle of Wight . She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight , and she calls it _ the _ _ Island _ , as if there were no other island in the world . I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself , if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is . I can not remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet . How long ago it is , aunt , since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England , with the dates of their accession , and most of the principal events of their reigns ! \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d added the other ; \u201c and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus ; besides a great deal of the heathen mythology , and all the metals , semi - metals , planets , and distinguished philosophers . \u201d \u201c Very true indeed , my dears , but you are blessed with wonderful memories , and your poor cousin has probably none at all . There is a vast deal of difference in memories , as well as in everything else , and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin , and pity her deficiency . And remember that , if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves , you should always be modest ; for , much as you know already , there is a great deal more for you to learn . \u201d \u201c Yes , I know there is , till I am seventeen . But I must tell you another thing of Fanny , so odd and so stupid . Do you know , she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing . \u201d \u201c To be sure , my dear , that is very stupid indeed , and shows a great want of genius and emulation . But , all things considered , I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so , for , though you know ( owing to me ) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you , it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;\u2014on the contrary , it is much more desirable that there should be a difference . \u201d Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her nieces \u2019 minds ; and it is not very wonderful that , with all their promising talents and early information , they should be entirely deficient in the less common acquirements of self - knowledge , generosity and humility . In everything but disposition they were admirably taught . Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting , because , though a truly anxious father , he was not outwardly affectionate , and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him . To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest attention . She had not time for such cares . She was a woman who spent her days in sitting , nicely dressed , on a sofa , doing some long piece of needlework , of little use and no beauty , thinking more of her pug than her children , but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to inconvenience , guided in everything important by Sir Thomas , and in smaller concerns by her sister . Had she possessed greater leisure for the service of her girls , she would probably have supposed it unnecessary , for they were under the care of a governess , with proper masters , and could want nothing more . As for Fanny \u2019s being stupid at learning , \u201c she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people _ were _ stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . \u201d Fanny , with all her faults of ignorance and timidity , was fixed at Mansfield Park , and learning to transfer in its favour much of her attachment to her former home , grew up there not unhappily among her cousins . There was no positive ill - nature in Maria or Julia ; and though Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her , she thought too lowly of her own claims to feel injured by it . From about the time of her entering the family , Lady Bertram , in consequence of a little ill - health , and a great deal of indolence , gave up the house in town , which she had been used to occupy every spring , and remained wholly in the country , leaving Sir Thomas to attend his duty in Parliament , with whatever increase or diminution of comfort might arise from her absence . In the country , therefore , the Miss Bertrams continued to exercise their memories , practise their duets , and grow tall and womanly : and their father saw them becoming in person , manner , and accomplishments , everything that could satisfy his anxiety . His eldest son was careless and extravagant , and had already given him much uneasiness ; but his other children promised him nothing but good . His daughters , he felt , while they retained the name of Bertram , must be giving it new grace , and in quitting it , he trusted , would extend its respectable alliances ; and the character of Edmund , his strong good sense and uprightness of mind , bid most fairly for utility , honour , and happiness to himself and all his connexions . He was to be a clergyman . Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested , Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs. Price : he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit ; and Fanny , though almost totally separated from her family , was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them , or of anything at all promising in their situation or conduct . Once , and once only , in the course of many years , had she the happiness of being with William . Of the rest she saw nothing : nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again , even for a visit , nobody at home seemed to want her ; but William determining , soon after her removal , to be a sailor , was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshire before he went to sea . Their eager affection in meeting , their exquisite delight in being together , their hours of happy mirth , and moments of serious conference , may be imagined ; as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even to the last , and the misery of the girl when he left her . Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas holidays , when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin Edmund ; and he told her such charming things of what William was to do , and be hereafter , in consequence of his profession , as made her gradually admit that the separation might have some use . Edmund \u2019s friendship never failed her : his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind dispositions , and only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them . Without any display of doing more than the rest , or any fear of doing too much , he was always true to her interests , and considerate of her feelings , trying to make her good qualities understood , and to conquer the diffidence which prevented their being more apparent ; giving her advice , consolation , and encouragement . Kept back as she was by everybody else , his single support could not bring her forward ; but his attentions were otherwise of the highest importance in assisting the improvement of her mind , and extending its pleasures . He knew her to be clever , to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense , and a fondness for reading , which , properly directed , must be an education in itself . Miss Lee taught her French , and heard her read the daily portion of history ; but he recommended the books which charmed her leisure hours , he encouraged her taste , and corrected her judgment : he made reading useful by talking to her of what she read , and heightened its attraction by judicious praise . In return for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world except William : her heart was divided between the two .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 4], "text": "The
