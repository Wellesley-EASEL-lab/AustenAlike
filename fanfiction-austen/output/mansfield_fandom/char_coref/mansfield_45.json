{"document": "XLV At about the week \u2019s end from his return to Mansfield , Tom \u2019s immediate danger was over , and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his mother perfectly easy ; for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering , helpless state , and hearing only the best , and never thinking beyond what she heard , with no disposition for alarm and no aptitude at a hint , Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world for a little medical imposition . The fever was subdued ; the fever had been his complaint ; of course he would soon be well again . Lady Bertram could think nothing less , and Fanny shared her aunt \u2019s security , till she received a few lines from Edmund , written purposely to give her a clearer idea of his brother \u2019s situation , and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some strong hectic symptoms , which seemed to seize the frame on the departure of the fever . They judged it best that Lady Bertram should not be harassed by alarms which , it was to be hoped , would prove unfounded ; but there was no reason why Fanny should not know the truth . They were apprehensive for his lungs . A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram \u2019s sheets of paper could do . There was hardly any one in the house who might not have described , from personal observation , better than herself ; not one who was not more useful at times to her son . She could do nothing but glide in quietly and look at him ; but when able to talk or be talked to , or read to , Edmund was the companion he preferred . His aunt worried him by her cares , and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation or his voice to the level of irritation and feebleness . Edmund was all in all . Fanny would certainly believe him so at least , and must find that her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the attendant , supporter , cheerer of a suffering brother . There was not only the debility of recent illness to assist : there was also , as she now learnt , nerves much affected , spirits much depressed to calm and raise , and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly guided . The family were not consumptive , and she was more inclined to hope than fear for her cousin , except when she thought of Miss Crawford ; but Miss Crawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck , and to her selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son . Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten . Edmund \u2019s letter had this postscript . \u201c On the subject of my last , I had actually begun a letter when called away by Tom \u2019s illness , but I have now changed my mind , and fear to trust the influence of friends . When Tom is better , I shall go . \u201d Such was the state of Mansfield , and so it continued , with scarcely any change , till Easter . A line occasionally added by Edmund to his mother \u2019s letter was enough for Fanny \u2019s information . Tom \u2019s amendment was alarmingly slow . Easter came particularly late this year , as Fanny had most sorrowfully considered , on first learning that she had no chance of leaving Portsmouth till after it . It came , and she had yet heard nothing of her return \u2014 nothing even of the going to London , which was to precede her return . Her aunt often expressed a wish for her , but there was no notice , no message from the uncle on whom all depended . She supposed he could not yet leave his son , but it was a cruel , a terrible delay to her . The end of April was coming on ; it would soon be almost three months , instead of two , that she had been absent from them all , and that her days had been passing in a state of penance , which she loved them too well to hope they would thoroughly understand ; and who could yet say when there might be leisure to think of or fetch her ? Her eagerness , her impatience , her longings to be with them , were such as to bring a line or two of Cowper \u2019s Tirocinium for ever before her . \u201c With what intense desire she wants her home , \u201d was continually on her tongue , as the truest description of a yearning which she could not suppose any schoolboy \u2019s bosom to feel more keenly . When she had been coming to Portsmouth , she had loved to call it her home , had been fond of saying that she was going home ; the word had been very dear to her , and so it still was , but it must be applied to Mansfield . _ That _ was now the home . Portsmouth was Portsmouth ; Mansfield was home . They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of her secret meditations , and nothing was more consolatory to her than to find her aunt using the same language : \u201c I can not but say I much regret your being from home at this distressing time , so very trying to my spirits . I trust and hope , and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so long again , \u201d were most delightful sentences to her . Still , however , it was her private regale . Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to betray such a preference of her uncle \u2019s house . It was always : \u201c When I go back into Northamptonshire , or when I return to Mansfield , I shall do so and so . \u201d For a great while it was so , but at last the longing grew stronger , it overthrew caution , and she found herself talking of what she should do when she went home before she was aware . She reproached herself , coloured , and looked fearfully towards her father and mother . She need not have been uneasy . There was no sign of displeasure , or even of hearing her . They were perfectly free from any jealousy of Mansfield . She was as welcome to wish herself there as to be there . It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring . She had not known before what pleasures she _ had _ to lose in passing March and April in a town . She had not known before how much the beginnings and progress of vegetation had delighted her . What animation , both of body and mind , she had derived from watching the advance of that season which can not , in spite of its capriciousness , be unlovely , and seeing its increasing beauties from the earliest flowers in the warmest divisions of her aunt \u2019s garden , to the opening of leaves of her uncle \u2019s plantations , and the glory of his woods . To be losing such pleasures was no trifle ; to be losing them , because she was in the midst of closeness and noise , to have confinement , bad air , bad smells , substituted for liberty , freshness , fragrance , and verdure , was infinitely worse : but even these incitements to regret were feeble , compared with what arose from the conviction of being missed by her best friends , and the longing to be useful to those who were wanting her ! Could she have been at home , she might have been of service to every creature in the house . She felt that she must have been of use to all . To all she must have saved some trouble of head or hand ; and were it only in supporting the spirits of her aunt Bertram , keeping her from the evil of solitude , or the still greater evil of a restless , officious companion , too apt to be heightening danger in order to enhance her own importance , her being there would have been a general good . She loved to fancy how she could have read to her aunt , how she could have talked to her , and tried at once to make her feel the blessing of what was , and prepare her mind for what might be ; and how many walks up and down stairs she might have saved her , and how many messages she might have carried . It astonished her that Tom \u2019s sisters could be satisfied with remaining in London at such a time , through an illness which had now , under different degrees of danger , lasted several weeks . _ They _ might return to Mansfield when they chose ; travelling could be no difficulty to _ them _ , and she could not comprehend how both could still keep away . If Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations , Julia was certainly able to quit London whenever she chose . It appeared from one of her aunt \u2019s letters that Julia had offered to return if wanted , but this was all . It was evident that she would rather remain where she was . Fanny was disposed to think the influence of London very much at war with all respectable attachments . She saw the proof of it in Miss Crawford , as well as in her cousins ; _ her _ attachment to Edmund had been respectable , the most respectable part of her character ; her friendship for herself had at least been blameless . Where was either sentiment now ? It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her , that she had some reason to think lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelt on . It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford or of her other connexions in town , except through Mansfield , and she was beginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr. Crawford had gone into Norfolk again or not till they met , and might never hear from his sister any more this spring , when the following letter was received to revive old and create some new sensations \u2014 \u201c Forgive me , my dear Fanny , as soon as you can , for my long silence , and behave as if you could forgive me directly . This is my modest request and expectation , for you are so good , that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve , and I write now to beg an immediate answer . I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park , and you , no doubt , are perfectly able to give it . One should be a brute not to feel for the distress they are in ; and from what I hear , poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery . I thought little of his illness at first . I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with , and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder , and was chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him ; but now it is confidently asserted that he is really in a decline , that the symptoms are most alarming , and that part of the family , at least , are aware of it . If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed . I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake , but the report is so prevalent that I confess I can not help trembling . To have such a fine young man cut off in the flower of his days is most melancholy . Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully . I really am quite agitated on the subject . Fanny , Fanny , I see you smile and look cunning , but , upon my honour , I never bribed a physician in my life . Poor young man ! If he is to die , there will be _ two _ poor young men less in the world ; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one , that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of them . It was a foolish precipitation last Christmas , but the evil of a few days may be blotted out in part . Varnish and gilding hide many stains . It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name . With real affection , Fanny , like mine , more might be overlooked . Write to me by return of post , judge of my anxiety , and do not trifle with it . Tell me the real truth , as you have it from the fountainhead . And now , do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own . Believe me , they are not only natural , they are philanthropic and virtuous . I put it to your conscience , whether \u2018 Sir Edmund \u2019 would not do more good with all the Bertram property than any other possible \u2018 Sir . \u2019 Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you , but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth , his sisters not being within my reach . Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham ( as to be sure you know ) , and is not yet returned ; and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square , but I forget their name and street . Could I immediately apply to either , however , I should still prefer you , because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up , as to shut their eyes to the truth . I suppose Mrs. R. \u2019s Easter holidays will not last much longer ; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her . The Aylmers are pleasant people ; and her husband away , she can have nothing but enjoyment . I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to Bath , to fetch his mother ; but how will she and the dowager agree in one house ? Henry is not at hand , so I have nothing to say from him . Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago , but for this illness?\u2014Yours ever , Mary . \u201d \u201c I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in , but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it . Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended ; he saw her this morning : she returns to Wimpole Street to - day ; the old lady is come . Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond . He does it every spring . Be assured he cares for nobody but you . At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours . In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul . Dear Fanny , write directly , and tell us to come . It will do us all good . He and I can go to the Parsonage , you know , and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park . It would really be gratifying to see them all again , and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to them ; and as to yourself , you must feel yourself to be so wanted there , that you can not in conscience \u2014 conscientious as you are \u2014 keep away , when you have the means of returning . I have not time or patience to give half Henry \u2019s messages ; be satisfied that the spirit of each and every one is unalterable affection . \u201d Fanny \u2019s disgust at the greater part of this letter , with her extreme reluctance to bring the writer of it and her cousin Edmund together , would have made her ( as she felt ) incapable of judging impartially whether the concluding offer might be accepted or not . To herself , individually , it was most tempting . To be finding herself , perhaps within three days , transported to Mansfield , was an image of the greatest felicity , but it would have been a material drawback to be owing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct , at the present moment , she saw so much to condemn : the sister \u2019s feelings , the brother \u2019s conduct , _ her _ cold - hearted ambition , _ his _ thoughtless vanity . To have him still the acquaintance , the flirt perhaps , of Mrs. Rushworth ! She was mortified . She had thought better of him . Happily , however , she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful notions of right ; there was no occasion to determine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not . She had a rule to apply to , which settled everything . Her awe of her uncle , and her dread of taking a liberty with him , made it instantly plain to her what she had to do . She must absolutely decline the proposal . If he wanted , he would send for her ; and even to offer an early return was a presumption which hardly anything would have seemed to justify . She thanked Miss Crawford , but gave a decided negative . \u201c Her uncle , she understood , meant to fetch her ; and as her cousin \u2019s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary , she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present , and that she should be felt an encumbrance . \u201d Her representation of her cousin \u2019s state at this time was exactly according to her own belief of it , and such as she supposed would convey to the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything she was wishing for . Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman , it seemed , under certain conditions of wealth ; and this , she suspected , was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon . She had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but money .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 9], "text": "his"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "Tom"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text":
