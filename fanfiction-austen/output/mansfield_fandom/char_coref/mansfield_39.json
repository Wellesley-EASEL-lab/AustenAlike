{"document": "XXXIX Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece \u2019s feelings , when she wrote her first letter to her aunt , he would not have despaired ; for though a good night \u2019s rest , a pleasant morning , the hope of soon seeing William again , and the comparatively quiet state of the house , from Tom and Charles being gone to school , Sam on some project of his own , and her father on his usual lounges , enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home , there were still , to her own perfect consciousness , many drawbacks suppressed . Could he have seen only half that she felt before the end of a week , he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of her , and been delighted with his own sagacity . Before the week ended , it was all disappointment . In the first place , William was gone . The Thrush had had her orders , the wind had changed , and he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth ; and during those days she had seen him only twice , in a short and hurried way , when he had come ashore on duty . There had been no free conversation , no walk on the ramparts , no visit to the dockyard , no acquaintance with the Thrush , nothing of all that they had planned and depended on . Everything in that quarter failed her , except William \u2019s affection . His last thought on leaving home was for her . He stepped back again to the door to say , \u201c Take care of Fanny , mother . She is tender , and not used to rough it like the rest of us . I charge you , take care of Fanny . \u201d William was gone : and the home he had left her in was , Fanny could not conceal it from herself , in almost every respect the very reverse of what she could have wished . It was the abode of noise , disorder , and impropriety . Nobody was in their right place , nothing was done as it ought to be . She could not respect her parents as she had hoped . On her father , her confidence had not been sanguine , but he was more negligent of his family , his habits were worse , and his manners coarser , than she had been prepared for . He did not want abilities but he had no curiosity , and no information beyond his profession ; he read only the newspaper and the navy - list ; he talked only of the dockyard , the harbour , Spithead , and the Motherbank ; he swore and he drank , he was dirty and gross . She had never been able to recall anything approaching to tenderness in his former treatment of herself . There had remained only a general impression of roughness and loudness ; and now he scarcely ever noticed her , but to make her the object of a coarse joke . Her disappointment in her mother was greater : _ there _ she had hoped much , and found almost nothing . Every flattering scheme of being of consequence to her soon fell to the ground . Mrs. Price was not unkind ; but , instead of gaining on her affection and confidence , and becoming more and more dear , her daughter never met with greater kindness from her than on the first day of her arrival . The instinct of nature was soon satisfied , and Mrs. Price \u2019s attachment had no other source . Her heart and her time were already quite full ; she had neither leisure nor affection to bestow on Fanny . Her daughters never had been much to her . She was fond of her sons , especially of William , but Betsey was the first of her girls whom she had ever much regarded . To her she was most injudiciously indulgent . William was her pride ; Betsey her darling ; and John , Richard , Sam , Tom , and Charles occupied all the rest of her maternal solicitude , alternately her worries and her comforts . These shared her heart : her time was given chiefly to her house and her servants . Her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle ; all was busy without getting on , always behindhand and lamenting it , without altering her ways ; wishing to be an economist , without contrivance or regularity ; dissatisfied with her servants , without skill to make them better , and whether helping , or reprimanding , or indulging them , without any power of engaging their respect . Of her two sisters , Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram than Mrs. Norris . She was a manager by necessity , without any of Mrs. Norris \u2019s inclination for it , or any of her activity . Her disposition was naturally easy and indolent , like Lady Bertram \u2019s ; and a situation of similar affluence and do - nothingness would have been much more suited to her capacity than the exertions and self - denials of the one which her imprudent marriage had placed her in . She might have made just as good a woman of consequence as Lady Bertram , but Mrs. Norris would have been a more respectable mother of nine children on a small income . Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of . She might scruple to make use of the words , but she must and did feel that her mother was a partial , ill - judging parent , a dawdle , a slattern , who neither taught nor restrained her children , whose house was the scene of mismanagement and discomfort from beginning to end , and who had no talent , no conversation , no affection towards herself ; no curiosity to know her better , no desire of her friendship , and no inclination for her company that could lessen her sense of such feelings . Fanny was very anxious to be useful , and not to appear above her home , or in any way disqualified or disinclined , by her foreign education , from contributing her help to its comforts , and therefore set about working for Sam immediately ; and by working early and late , with perseverance and great despatch , did so much that the boy was shipped off at last , with more than half his linen ready . She had great pleasure in feeling her usefulness , but could not conceive how they would have managed without her . Sam , loud and overbearing as he was , she rather regretted when he went , for he was clever and intelligent , and glad to be employed in any errand in the town ; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan , given as they were , though very reasonable in themselves , with ill - timed and powerless warmth , was beginning to be influenced by Fanny \u2019s services and gentle persuasions ; and she found that the best of the three younger ones was gone in him : Tom and Charles being at least as many years as they were his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason , which might suggest the expediency of making friends , and of endeavouring to be less disagreeable . Their sister soon despaired of making the smallest impression on _ them _ ; they were quite untameable by any means of address which she had spirits or time to attempt . Every afternoon brought a return of their riotous games all over the house ; and she very early learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday \u2019s constant half - holiday . Betsey , too , a spoiled child , trained up to think the alphabet her greatest enemy , left to be with the servants at her pleasure , and then encouraged to report any evil of them , she was almost as ready to despair of being able to love or assist ; and of Susan \u2019s temper she had many doubts . Her continual disagreements with her mother , her rash squabbles with Tom and Charles , and petulance with Betsey , were at least so distressing to Fanny that , though admitting they were by no means without provocation , she feared the disposition that could push them to such length must be far from amiable , and from affording any repose to herself . Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head , and teach her to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings . On the contrary , she could think of nothing but Mansfield , its beloved inmates , its happy ways . Everything where she now was in full contrast to it . The elegance , propriety , regularity , harmony , and perhaps , above all , the peace and tranquillity of Mansfield , were brought to her remembrance every hour of the day , by the prevalence of everything opposite to them _ here _ . The living in incessant noise was , to a frame and temper delicate and nervous like Fanny \u2019s , an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony could have entirely atoned for . It was the greatest misery of all . At Mansfield , no sounds of contention , no raised voice , no abrupt bursts , no tread of violence , was ever heard ; all proceeded in a regular course of cheerful orderliness ; everybody had their due importance ; everybody \u2019s feelings were consulted . If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting , good sense and good breeding supplied its place ; and as to the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris , they were short , they were trifling , they were as a drop of water to the ocean , compared with the ceaseless tumult of her present abode . Here everybody was noisy , every voice was loud ( excepting , perhaps , her mother \u2019s , which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram \u2019s , only worn into fretfulness ) . Whatever was wanted was hallooed for , and the servants hallooed out their excuses from the kitchen . The doors were in constant banging , the stairs were never at rest , nothing was done without a clatter , nobody sat still , and nobody could command attention when they spoke . In a review of the two houses , as they appeared to her before the end of a week , Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson \u2019s celebrated judgment as to matrimony and celibacy , and say , that though Mansfield Park might have some pains , Portsmouth could have no pleasures .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 4], "text": "Sir Thomas"}, {"position": [7, 8], "text": "his"},
