{"document": "XLVII It had been a miserable party , each of the three believing themselves most miserable . Mrs. Norris , however , as most attached to Maria , was really the greatest sufferer . Maria was her first favourite , the dearest of all ; the match had been her own contriving , as she had been wo nt with such pride of heart to feel and say , and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her . She was an altered creature , quieted , stupefied , indifferent to everything that passed . The being left with her sister and nephew , and all the house under her care , had been an advantage entirely thrown away ; she had been unable to direct or dictate , or even fancy herself useful . When really touched by affliction , her active powers had been all benumbed ; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her the smallest support or attempt at support . She had done no more for them than they had done for each other . They had been all solitary , helpless , and forlorn alike ; and now the arrival of the others only established her superiority in wretchedness . Her companions were relieved , but there was no good for _ her _ . Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt ; but Mrs. Norris , instead of having comfort from either , was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom , in the blindness of her anger , she could have charged as the daemon of the piece . Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened . Susan too was a grievance . She had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks , but she felt her as a spy , and an intruder , and an indigent niece , and everything most odious . By her other aunt , Susan was received with quiet kindness . Lady Bertram could not give her much time , or many words , but she felt her , as Fanny \u2019s sister , to have a claim at Mansfield , and was ready to kiss and like her ; and Susan was more than satisfied , for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill - humour was to be expected from aunt Norris ; and was so provided with happiness , so strong in that best of blessings , an escape from many certain evils , that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others . She was now left a good deal to herself , to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could , and spent her days very happily in so doing , while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up , or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them , at this time , for everything like comfort ; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother \u2019s , and Fanny devoted to her aunt Bertram , returning to every former office with more than former zeal , and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed so much to want her . To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny , talk and lament , was all Lady Bertram \u2019s consolation . To be listened to and borne with , and hear the voice of kindness and sympathy in return , was everything that could be done for her . To be otherwise comforted was out of the question . The case admitted of no comfort . Lady Bertram did not think deeply , but , guided by Sir Thomas , she thought justly on all important points ; and she saw , therefore , in all its enormity , what had happened , and neither endeavoured herself , nor required Fanny to advise her , to think little of guilt and infamy . Her affections were not acute , nor was her mind tenacious . After a time , Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects , and revive some interest in the usual occupations ; but whenever Lady Bertram _ was _ fixed on the event , she could see it only in one light , as comprehending the loss of a daughter , and a disgrace never to be wiped off . Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired . Her aunt was no very methodical narrator , but with the help of some letters to and from Sir Thomas , and what she already knew herself , and could reasonably combine , she was soon able to understand quite as much as she wished of the circumstances attending the story . Mrs. Rushworth had gone , for the Easter holidays , to Twickenham , with a family whom she had just grown intimate with : a family of lively , agreeable manners , and probably of morals and discretion to suit , for to _ their _ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times . His having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew . Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath , to pass a few days with his mother , and bring her back to town , and Maria was with these friends without any restraint , without even Julia ; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street two or three weeks before , on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas ; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates \u2019s account . Very soon after the Rushworths \u2019 return to Wimpole Street , Sir Thomas had received a letter from an old and most particular friend in London , who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter , wrote to recommend Sir Thomas \u2019s coming to London himself , and using his influence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks , and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy . Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter , without communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield , when it was followed by another , sent express from the same friend , to break to him the almost desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people . Mrs. Rushworth had left her husband \u2019s house : Mr. Rushworth had been in great anger and distress to _ him _ ( Mr. Harding ) for his advice ; Mr. Harding feared there had been _ at _ _ least _ very flagrant indiscretion . The maidservant of Mrs. Rushworth , senior , threatened alarmingly . He was doing all in his power to quiet everything , with the hope of Mrs. Rushworth \u2019s return , but was so much counteracted in Wimpole Street by the influence of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s mother , that the worst consequences might be apprehended . This dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest of the family . Sir Thomas set off , Edmund would go with him , and the others had been left in a state of wretchedness , inferior only to what followed the receipt of the next letters from London . Everything was by that time public beyond a hope . The servant of Mrs. Rushworth , the mother , had exposure in her power , and supported by her mistress , was not to be silenced . The two ladies , even in the short time they had been together , had disagreed ; and the bitterness of the elder against her daughter - in - law might perhaps arise almost as much from the personal disrespect with which she had herself been treated as from sensibility for her son . However that might be , she was unmanageable . But had she been less obstinate , or of less weight with her son , who was always guided by the last speaker , by the person who could get hold of and shut him up , the case would still have been hopeless , for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear again , and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford , who had quitted his uncle \u2019s house , as for a journey , on the very day of her absenting herself . Sir Thomas , however , remained yet a little longer in town , in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice , though all was lost on the side of character . _ His _ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of . There was but one of his children who was not at this time a source of misery to him . Tom \u2019s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister \u2019s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia \u2019s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was . His letters expressed how much he deplored it . Under any circumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance ; but to have it so clandestinely formed , and such a period chosen for its completion , placed Julia \u2019s feelings in a most unfavourable light , and severely aggravated the folly of her choice . He called it a bad thing , done in the worst manner , and at the worst time ; and though Julia was yet as more pardonable than Maria as folly than vice , he could not but regard the step she had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a conclusion hereafter like her sister \u2019s . Such was his opinion of the set into which she had thrown herself . Fanny felt for him most acutely . He could have no comfort but in Edmund . Every other child must be racking his heart . His displeasure against herself she trusted , reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris , would now be done away . _ She _ should be justified . Mr. Crawford would have fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him ; but this , though most material to herself , would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas . Her uncle \u2019s displeasure was terrible to her ; but what could her justification or her gratitude and attachment do for him ? His stay must be on Edmund alone . She was mistaken , however , in supposing that Edmund gave his father no present pain . It was of a much less poignant nature than what the others excited ; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very deeply involved in the offence of his sister and friend ; cut off by it , as he must be , from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubted attachment and strong probability of success ; and who , in everything but this despicable brother , would have been so eligible a connexion . He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs . Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle \u2019s feelings , Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss Crawford \u2019s character . Had he been privy to her conversation with his son , he would not have wished her to belong to him , though her twenty thousand pounds had been forty . That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a doubt with Fanny ; and yet , till she knew that he felt the same , her own conviction was insufficient . She thought he did , but she wanted to be assured of it . If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which had sometimes been too much for her before , it would be most consoling ; but _ that _ she found was not to be . She seldom saw him : never alone . He probably avoided being alone with her . What was to be inferred ? That his judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share of this family affliction , but that it was too keenly felt to be a subject of the slightest communication . This must be his state . He yielded , but it was with agonies which did not admit of speech . Long , long would it be ere Miss Crawford \u2019s name passed his lips again , or she could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had been . It _ was _ long . They reached Mansfield on Thursday , and it was not till Sunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject . Sitting with her on Sunday evening \u2014 a wet Sunday evening \u2014 the very time of all others when , if a friend is at hand , the heart must be opened , and everything told ; no one else in the room , except his mother , who , after hearing an affecting sermon , had cried herself to sleep , it was impossible not to speak ; and so , with the usual beginnings , hardly to be traced as to what came first , and the usual declaration that if she would listen to him for a few minutes , he should be very brief , and certainly never tax her kindness in the same way again ; she need not fear a repetition ; it would be a subject prohibited entirely : he entered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first interest to himself , to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced . How Fanny listened , with what curiosity and concern , what pain and what delight , how the agitation of his voice was watched , and how carefully her own eyes were fixed on any object but himself , may be imagined . The opening was alarming . He had seen Miss Crawford . He had been invited to see her . He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call ; and regarding it as what was meant to be the last , last interview of friendship , and investing her with all the feelings of shame and wretchedness which Crawford \u2019s sister ought to have known , he had gone to her in such a state of mind , so softened , so devoted , as made it for a few moments impossible to Fanny \u2019s fears that it should be the last . But as he proceeded in his story , these fears were over . She had met him , he said , with a serious \u2014 certainly a serious \u2014 even an agitated air ; but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence , she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him . \u201c \u2018 I heard you were in town , \u2019 said she ; \u2018 I wanted to see you . Let us talk over this sad business . What can equal the folly of our two relations ? \u2019 I could not answer , but I believe my looks spoke . She felt reproved . Sometimes how quick to feel ! With a graver look and voice she then added , \u2018 I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister \u2019s expense . \u2019 So she began , but how she went on , Fanny , is not fit , is hardly fit to be repeated to you . I can not recall all her words . I would not dwell upon them if I could . Their substance was great anger at the _ folly _ of each . She reprobated her brother \u2019s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear . Guess what I must have felt . To hear the woman whom \u2014 no harsher name than folly given ! So voluntarily , so freely , so coolly to canvass it ! No reluctance , no horror , no feminine , shall I say , no modest loathings ? This is what the world does . For where , Fanny , shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed ? Spoilt , spoilt ! \u201d After a little reflection , he went on with a sort of desperate calmness . \u201c I will tell you everything , and then have done for ever . She saw it only as folly , and that folly stamped only by exposure . The want of common discretion , of caution : his going down to Richmond for the whole time of her being at Twickenham ; her putting herself in the power of a servant ; it was the detection , in short \u2014 oh , Fanny ! it was the detection , not the offence , which she reprobated . It was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity , and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her . \u201d He stopt . \u201c And what , \u201d said Fanny ( believing herself required to speak ) , \u201c what could you say ? \u201d \u201c Nothing , nothing to be understood . I was like a man stunned . She went on , began to talk of you ; yes , then she began to talk of you , regretting , as well she might , the loss of such a\u2014. There she spoke very rationally . But she has always done justice to you . \u2018 He has thrown away , \u2019 said she , \u2018 such a woman as he will never see again . She would have fixed him ; she would have made him happy for ever . \u2019 My dearest Fanny , I am giving you , I hope , more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been \u2014 but what never can be now . You do not wish me to be silent ? If you do , give me but a look , a word , and I have done . \u201d No look or word was given . \u201c Thank God , \u201d said he . \u201c We were all disposed to wonder , but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer . She spoke of you with high praise and warm affection ; yet , even here , there was alloy , a dash of evil ; for in the midst of it she could exclaim , \u2018 Why would not she have him ? It is all her fault . Simple girl ! I shall never forgive her . Had she accepted him as she ought , they might now have been on the point of marriage , and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object . He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again . It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation , in yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham . \u2019 Could you have believed it possible ? But the charm is broken . My eyes are opened . \u201d \u201c Cruel ! \u201d said Fanny , \u201c quite cruel . At such a moment to give way to gaiety , to speak with lightness , and to you ! Absolute cruelty . \u201d \u201c Cruelty , do you call it ? We differ there . No , hers is not a cruel nature . I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings . The evil lies yet deeper : in her total ignorance , unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings ; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did . She was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak , as she imagined everybody else would speak . Hers are not faults of temper . She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one , and though I may deceive myself , I can not but think that for me , for my feelings , she would\u2014. Hers are faults of principle , Fanny ; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted , vitiated mind . Perhaps it is best for me , since it leaves me so little to regret . Not so , however . Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her , rather than have to think of her as I do . I told her so . \u201d \u201c Did you ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; when I left her I told her so . \u201d \u201c How long were you together ? \u201d \u201c Five - and - twenty minutes . Well , she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them . She spoke of it , Fanny , with a steadier voice than I can . \u201d He was obliged to pause more than once as he continued . \u201c \u2018 We must persuade Henry to marry her , \u2019 said she ; \u2018 and what with honour , and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from Fanny , I do not despair of it . Fanny he must give up . I do not think that even _ he _ could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp , and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty . My influence , which is not small shall all go that way ; and when once married , and properly supported by her own family , people of respectability as they are , she may recover her footing in society to a certain degree . In some circles , we know , she would never be admitted , but with good dinners , and large parties , there will always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance ; and there is , undoubtedly , more liberality and candour on those points than formerly . What I advise is , that your father be quiet . Do not let him injure his own cause by interference . Persuade him to let things take their course . If by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave Henry \u2019s protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him . I know how he is likely to be influenced . Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion , and it may all end well ; but if he get his daughter away , it will be destroying the chief hold . \u2019 \u201d After repeating this , Edmund was so much affected that Fanny , watching him with silent , but most tender concern , was almost sorry that the subject had been entered on at all . It was long before he could speak again . At last , \u201c Now , Fanny , \u201d said he , \u201c I shall soon have done . I have told you the substance of all that she said . As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it . That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now . And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . She was astonished , exceedingly astonished \u2014 more than astonished . I saw her change countenance . She turned extremely red . I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it . She would have laughed if she could . It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , \u2018 A pretty good lecture , upon my word . Was it part of your last sermon ? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . \u2019 She tried to speak carelessly , but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . \u2018 Mr. Bertram , \u2019 said she . I looked back . \u2018 Mr. Bertram , \u2019 said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! Equally in brother and sister deceived ! I thank you for your patience , Fanny . This has been the greatest relief , and now we will have done . \u201d And such was Fanny \u2019s dependence on his words , that for five minutes she thought they _ had _ done . Then , however , it all came on again , or something very like it , and nothing less than Lady Bertram \u2019s rousing thoroughly up could really close such a conversation . Till that happened , they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone , and how she had attached him , and how delightful nature had made her , and how excellent she would have been , had she fallen into good hands earlier . Fanny , now at liberty to speak openly , felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of her real character , by some hint of what share his brother \u2019s state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete reconciliation . This was not an agreeable intimation . Nature resisted it for a while . It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had her more disinterested in her attachment ; but his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason . He submitted to believe that Tom \u2019s illness had influenced her , only reserving for himself this consoling thought , that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits , she had certainly been _ more _ attached to him than could have been expected , and for his sake been more near doing right . Fanny thought exactly the same ; and they were also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect , the indelible impression , which such a disappointment must make on his mind . Time would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings , but still it was a sort of thing which he never could get entirely the better of ; and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could \u2014 it was too impossible to be named but with indignation . Fanny \u2019s friendship was all that he had to cling to .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [26, 27], "text": "Maria"}, {"position": [34, 35], "text": "Maria"}, {"position": [101, 102],
