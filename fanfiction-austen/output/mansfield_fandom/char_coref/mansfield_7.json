{"document": "VII \u201c Well , Fanny , and how do you like Miss Crawford _ now _ ? \u201d said Edmund the next day , after thinking some time on the subject himself . \u201c How did you like her yesterday ? \u201d \u201c Very well \u2014 very much . I like to hear her talk . She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her . \u201d \u201c It is her countenance that is so attractive . She has a wonderful play of feature ! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you , Fanny , as not quite right ? \u201d \u201c Oh yes ! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did . I was quite astonished . An uncle with whom she has been living so many years , and who , whatever his faults may be , is so very fond of her brother , treating him , they say , quite like a son . I could not have believed it ! \u201d \u201c I thought you would be struck . It was very wrong ; very indecorous . \u201d \u201c And very ungrateful , I think . \u201d \u201c Ungrateful is a strong word . I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her _ gratitude _ ; his wife certainly had ; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt \u2019s memory which misleads her here . She is awkwardly circumstanced . With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford , without throwing a shade on the Admiral . I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements , though the Admiral \u2019s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife ; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely . I do not censure her _ opinions _ ; but there certainly _ is _ impropriety in making them public . \u201d \u201c Do not you think , \u201d said Fanny , after a little consideration , \u201c that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford , as her niece has been entirely brought up by her ? She can not have given her right notions of what was due to the Admiral . \u201d \u201c That is a fair remark . Yes , we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt ; and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under . But I think her present home must do her good . Mrs. Grant \u2019s manners are just what they ought to be . She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection . \u201d \u201c Yes , except as to his writing her such short letters . She made me almost laugh ; but I can not rate so very highly the love or good - nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters , when they are separated . I am sure William would never have used _ me _ so , under any circumstances . And what right had she to suppose that _ you _ would not write long letters when you were absent ? \u201d \u201c The right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill - humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse . She is perfectly feminine , except in the instances we have been speaking of . There she can not be justified . I am glad you saw it all as I did . \u201d Having formed her mind and gained her affections , he had a good chance of her thinking like him ; though at this period , and on this subject , there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity , for he was in a line of admiration of Miss Crawford , which might lead him where Fanny could not follow . Miss Crawford \u2019s attractions did not lessen . The harp arrived , and rather added to her beauty , wit , and good - humour ; for she played with the greatest obligingness , with an expression and taste which were peculiarly becoming , and there was something clever to be said at the close of every air . Edmund was at the Parsonage every day , to be indulged with his favourite instrument : one morning secured an invitation for the next ; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener , and every thing was soon in a fair train . A young woman , pretty , lively , with a harp as elegant as herself , and both placed near a window , cut down to the ground , and opening on a little lawn , surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer , was enough to catch any man \u2019s heart . The season , the scene , the air , were all favourable to tenderness and sentiment . Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not without their use : it was all in harmony ; and as everything will turn to account when love is once set going , even the sandwich tray , and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it , were worth looking at . Without studying the business , however , or knowing what he was about , Edmund was beginning , at the end of a week of such intercourse , to be a good deal in love ; and to the credit of the lady it may be added that , without his being a man of the world or an elder brother , without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk , he began to be agreeable to her . She felt it to be so , though she had not foreseen , and could hardly understand it ; for he was not pleasant by any common rule : he talked no nonsense ; he paid no compliments ; his opinions were unbending , his attentions tranquil and simple . There was a charm , perhaps , in his sincerity , his steadiness , his integrity , which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel , though not equal to discuss with herself . She did not think very much about it , however : he pleased her for the present ; she liked to have him near her ; it was enough . Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not . She was a little surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford , and not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed , and of which _ she _ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature whenever she was in her company ; but so it was . Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford , but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since been spared ; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him , lest it should appear like ill - nature . The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride , which the former caught , soon after her being settled at Mansfield , from the example of the young ladies at the Park , and which , when Edmund \u2019s acquaintance with her increased , led to his encouraging the wish , and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts , as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish . No pain , no injury , however , was designed by him to his cousin in this offer : _ she _ was not to lose a day \u2019s exercise by it . The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to begin ; and Fanny , on its being first proposed , so far from feeling slighted , was almost over - powered with gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it . Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself , and no inconvenience to Fanny . Edmund , who had taken down the mare and presided at the whole , returned with it in excellent time , before either Fanny or the steady old coachman , who always attended her when she rode without her cousins , were ready to set forward . The second day \u2019s trial was not so guiltless . Miss Crawford \u2019s enjoyment of riding was such that she did not know how to leave off . Active and fearless , and though rather small , strongly made , she seemed formed for a horsewoman ; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise , something was probably added in Edmund \u2019s attendance and instructions , and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress , to make her unwilling to dismount . Fanny was ready and waiting , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone , and still no horse was announced , no Edmund appeared . To avoid her aunt , and look for him , she went out . The houses , though scarcely half a mile apart , were not within sight of each other ; but , by walking fifty yards from the hall door , she could look down the park , and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes , gently rising beyond the village road ; and in Dr. Grant \u2019s meadow she immediately saw the group \u2014 Edmund and Miss Crawford both on horse - back , riding side by side , Dr. and Mrs. Grant , and Mr. Crawford , with two or three grooms , standing about and looking on . A happy party it appeared to her , all interested in one object : cheerful beyond a doubt , for the sound of merriment ascended even to her . It was a sound which did not make _ her _ cheerful ; she wondered that Edmund should forget her , and felt a pang . She could not turn her eyes from the meadow ; she could not help watching all that passed . At first Miss Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field , which was not small , at a foot \u2019s pace ; then , at _ her _ apparent suggestion , they rose into a canter ; and to Fanny \u2019s timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat . After a few minutes they stopped entirely . Edmund was close to her ; he was speaking to her ; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle ; he had hold of her hand ; she saw it , or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach . She must not wonder at all this ; what could be more natural than that Edmund should be making himself useful , and proving his good - nature by any one ? She could not but think , indeed , that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble ; that it would have been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself ; but Mr. Crawford , with all his boasted good - nature , and all his coachmanship , probably knew nothing of the matter , and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund . She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty ; if she were forgotten , the poor mare should be remembered . Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse , and Miss Crawford still on horseback , but attended by Edmund on foot , pass through a gate into the lane , and so into the park , and make towards the spot where she stood . She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient ; and walked to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion . \u201c My dear Miss Price , \u201d said Miss Crawford , as soon as she was at all within hearing , \u201c I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself \u2014 I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me . Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure . \u201d Fanny \u2019s answer was extremely civil , and Edmund added his conviction that she could be in no hurry . \u201c For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , \u201d said he , \u201c and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then . I wish _ you _ may not be fatigued by so much exercise . I wish you had saved yourself this walk home . \u201d \u201c No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , \u201d said she , as she sprang down with his help ; \u201c I am very strong . Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like . Miss Price , I give way to you with a very bad grace ; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride , and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear , delightful , beautiful animal . \u201d The old coachman , who had been waiting about with his own horse , now joining them , Fanny was lifted on hers , and they set off across another part of the park ; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing , as she looked back , that the others were walking down the hill together to the village ; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford \u2019s great cleverness as a horse - woman , which he had been watching with an interest almost equal to her own . \u201c It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding ! \u201d said he . \u201c I never see one sit a horse better . She did not seem to have a thought of fear . Very different from you , miss , when you first began , six years ago come next Easter . Lord bless you ! how you did tremble when Sir Thomas first had you put on ! \u201d In the drawing - room Miss Crawford was also celebrated . Her merit in being gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated by the Miss Bertrams ; her delight in riding was like their own ; her early excellence in it was like their own , and they had great pleasure in praising it . \u201c I was sure she would ride well , \u201d said Julia ; \u201c she has the make for it . Her figure is as neat as her brother \u2019s . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d added Maria , \u201c and her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character . I can not but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind . \u201d When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride the next day . \u201c No , I do not know \u2014 not if you want the mare , \u201d was her answer . \u201c I do not want her at all for myself , \u201d said he ; \u201c but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time \u2014 for a whole morning , in short . She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . But any morning will do for this . She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you . It would be very wrong if she did . _ She _ rides only for pleasure ; _ you _ for health . \u201d \u201c I shall not ride to - morrow , certainly , \u201d said Fanny ; \u201c I have been out very often lately , and would rather stay at home . You know I am strong enough now to walk very well . \u201d Edmund looked pleased , which must be Fanny \u2019s comfort , and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning : the party included all the young people but herself , and was much enjoyed at the time , and doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion . A successful scheme of this sort generally brings on another ; and the having been to Mansfield Common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after . There were many other views to be shewn ; and though the weather was hot , there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go . A young party is always provided with a shady lane . Four fine mornings successively were spent in this manner , in shewing the Crawfords the country , and doing the honours of its finest spots . Everything answered ; it was all gaiety and good - humour , the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure \u2014 till the fourth day , when the happiness of one of the party was exceedingly clouded . Miss Bertram was the one . Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage , and _ she _ was excluded . It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant , with perfect good - humour , on Mr. Rushworth \u2019s account , who was partly expected at the Park that day ; but it was felt as a very grievous injury , and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home . As Mr. Rushworth did _ not _ come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert . Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing - room , fresh with the evening air , glowing and cheerful , the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there , for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book , and Lady Bertram was half - asleep ; and even Mrs. Norris , discomposed by her niece \u2019s ill - humour , and having asked one or two questions about the dinner , which were not immediately attended to , seemed almost determined to say no more . For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars , to think beyond themselves ; but when the first pause came , Edmund , looking around , said , \u201c But where is Fanny ? Is she gone to bed ? \u201d \u201c No , not that I know of , \u201d replied Mrs. Norris ; \u201c she was here a moment ago . \u201d Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room , which was a very long one , told them that she was on the sofa . Mrs. Norris began scolding . \u201c That is a very foolish trick , Fanny , to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa . Why can not you come and sit here , and employ yourself as _ we _ do ? If you have no work of your own , I can supply you from the poor basket . There is all the new calico , that was bought last week , not touched yet . I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out . You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . \u201d Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good - humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , \u201c I must say , ma\u2019am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . \u201d \u201c Fanny , \u201d said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , \u201c I am sure you have the headache . \u201d She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . \u201c I can hardly believe you , \u201d he replied ; \u201c I know your looks too well . How long have you had it ? \u201d \u201c Since a little before dinner . It is nothing but the heat . \u201d \u201c Did you go out in the heat ? \u201d \u201c Go out ! to be sure she did , \u201d said Mrs. Norris : \u201c would you have her stay within such a fine day as this ? Were not we _ all _ out ? Even your mother was out to - day for above an hour . \u201d \u201c Yes , indeed , Edmund , \u201d added her ladyship , who had been thoroughly awakened by Mrs. Norris \u2019s sharp reprimand to Fanny ; \u201c I was out above an hour . I sat three - quarters of an hour in the flower - garden , while Fanny cut the roses ; and very pleasant it was , I assure you , but very hot . It was shady enough in the alcove , but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again . \u201d \u201c Fanny has been cutting roses , has she ? \u201d \u201c Yes , and I am afraid they will be the last this year . Poor thing ! _ She _ found it hot enough ; but they were so full - blown that one could not wait . \u201d \u201c There was no help for it , certainly , \u201d rejoined Mrs. Norris , in a rather softened voice ; \u201c but I question whether her headache might not be caught _ then _ , sister . There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun ; but I dare say it will be well to - morrow . Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar ; I always forget to have mine filled . \u201d \u201c She has got it , \u201d said Lady Bertram ; \u201c she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . \u201d \u201c What ! \u201d cried Edmund ; \u201c has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma\u2019am ? No wonder her head aches . \u201d Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia , and did not hear . \u201c I was afraid it would be too much for her , \u201d said Lady Bertram ; \u201c but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home . \u201d \u201c But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice ? \u201d \u201c No ; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry ; and , unluckily , Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key , so she was obliged to go again . \u201d Edmund got up and walked about the room , saying , \u201c And could nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny ? Upon my word , ma\u2019am , it has been a very ill - managed business . \u201d \u201c I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better , \u201d cried Mrs. Norris , unable to be longer deaf ; \u201c unless I had gone myself , indeed ; but I can not be in two places at once ; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother \u2019s dairymaid , by _ her _ desire , and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son , and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour . I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . And as for Fanny \u2019s just stepping down to my house for me \u2014 it is not much above a quarter of a mile \u2014 I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it . How often do I pace it three times a day , early and late , ay , and in all weathers too , and say nothing about it ? \u201d \u201c I wish Fanny had half your strength , ma\u2019am . \u201d \u201c If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon . She has not been out on horseback now this long while , and I am persuaded that , when she does not ride , she ought to walk . If she had been riding before , I should not have asked it of her . But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses ; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind ; and though the sun was strong , it was not so very hot . Between ourselves , Edmund , \u201d nodding significantly at his mother , \u201c it was cutting the roses , and dawdling about in the flower - garden , that did the mischief . \u201d \u201c I am afraid it was , indeed , \u201d said the more candid Lady Bertram , who had overheard her ; \u201c I am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody . It was as much as I could bear myself . Sitting and calling to Pug , and trying to keep him from the flower - beds , was almost too much for me . \u201d Edmund said no more to either lady ; but going quietly to another table , on which the supper - tray yet remained , brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny , and obliged her to drink the greater part . She wished to be able to decline it ; but the tears , which a variety of feelings created , made it easier to swallow than to speak . Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt , he was still more angry with himself . His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything which they had done . Nothing of this would have happened had she been properly considered ; but she had been left four days together without any choice of companions or exercise , and without any excuse for avoiding whatever her unreasonable aunts might require . He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding , and very seriously resolved , however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss Crawford \u2019s , that it should never happen again . Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her arrival at the Park . The state of her spirits had probably had its share in her indisposition ; for she had been feeling neglected , and been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past . As she leant on the sofa , to which she had retreated that she might not be seen , the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head ; and the sudden change which Edmund \u2019s kindness had then occasioned , made her hardly know how to support herself .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [4, 5], "text": "Fanny"}, {"position": [9, 10], "text": "you"}, {"position": [11, 13], "text":
