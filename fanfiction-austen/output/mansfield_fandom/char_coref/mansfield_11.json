{"document": "XI The day at Sotherton , with all its imperfections , afforded the Miss Bertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the letters from Antigua , which soon afterwards reached Mansfield . It was much pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father ; and to think of their father in England again within a certain period , which these letters obliged them to do , was a most unwelcome exercise . November was the black month fixed for his return . Sir Thomas wrote of it with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise . His business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his passage in the September packet , and he consequently looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November . Maria was more to be pitied than Julia ; for to her the father brought a husband , and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover , on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend . It was a gloomy prospect , and all she could do was to throw a mist over it , and hope when the mist cleared away she should see something else . It would hardly be _ early _ in November , there were generally delays , a bad passage or _ something _ ; that favouring _ something _ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look , or their understandings while they reason , feels the comfort of . It would probably be the middle of November at least ; the middle of November was three months off . Three months comprised thirteen weeks . Much might happen in thirteen weeks . Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that his daughters felt on the subject of his return , and would hardly have found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the breast of another young lady . Miss Crawford , on walking up with her brother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park , heard the good news ; and though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness , and to have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation , heard it with an attention not so easily satisfied . Mrs. Norris gave the particulars of the letters , and the subject was dropt ; but after tea , as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene , while the Miss Bertrams , Mr. Rushworth , and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte , she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group , and saying , \u201c How happy Mr. Rushworth looks ! He is thinking of November . \u201d Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too , but had nothing to say . \u201c Your father \u2019s return will be a very interesting event . \u201d \u201c It will , indeed , after such an absence ; an absence not only long , but including so many dangers . \u201d \u201c It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events : your sister \u2019s marriage , and your taking orders . \u201d \u201c Yes . \u201d \u201c Do n\u2019t be affronted , \u201d said she , laughing , \u201c but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes , who , after performing great exploits in a foreign land , offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return . \u201d \u201c There is no sacrifice in the case , \u201d replied Edmund , with a serious smile , and glancing at the pianoforte again ; \u201c it is entirely her own doing . \u201d \u201c Oh yes I know it is . I was merely joking . She has done no more than what every young woman would do ; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy . My other sacrifice , of course , you do not understand . \u201d \u201c My taking orders , I assure you , is quite as voluntary as Maria \u2019s marrying . \u201d \u201c It is fortunate that your inclination and your father \u2019s convenience should accord so well . There is a very good living kept for you , I understand , hereabouts . \u201d \u201c Which you suppose has biassed me ? \u201d \u201c But _ that _ I am sure it has not , \u201d cried Fanny . \u201c Thank you for your good word , Fanny , but it is more than I would affirm myself . On the contrary , the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me . Nor can I think it wrong that it should . There was no natural disinclination to be overcome , and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life . I was in safe hands . I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way , and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it . I have no doubt that I was biased , but I think it was blamelessly . \u201d \u201c It is the same sort of thing , \u201d said Fanny , after a short pause , \u201c as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy , or the son of a general to be in the army , and nobody sees anything wrong in that . Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best , or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear . \u201d \u201c No , my dear Miss Price , and for reasons good . The profession , either navy or army , is its own justification . It has everything in its favour : heroism , danger , bustle , fashion . Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society . Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors . \u201d \u201c But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected , you think ? \u201d said Edmund . \u201c To be justified in your eyes , he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision . \u201d \u201c What ! take orders without a living ! No ; that is madness indeed ; absolute madness . \u201d \u201c Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ? No ; for you certainly would not know what to say . But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument . As he can not be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession , as heroism , and noise , and fashion , are all against him , he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his . \u201d \u201c Oh ! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made , to the trouble of working for one ; and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat , drink , and grow fat . It is indolence , Mr. Bertram , indeed . Indolence and love of ease ; a want of all laudable ambition , of taste for good company , or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable , which make men clergymen . A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish \u2014 read the newspaper , watch the weather , and quarrel with his wife . His curate does all the work , and the business of his own life is to dine . \u201d \u201c There are such clergymen , no doubt , but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character . I suspect that in this comprehensive and ( may I say ) commonplace censure , you are not judging from yourself , but from prejudiced persons , whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing . It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy . You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively . You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle \u2019s table . \u201d \u201c I speak what appears to me the general opinion ; and where an opinion is general , it is usually correct . Though _ I _ have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen , it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information . \u201d \u201c Where any one body of educated men , of whatever denomination , are condemned indiscriminately , there must be a deficiency of information , or ( smiling ) of something else . Your uncle , and his brother admirals , perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom , good or bad , they were always wishing away . \u201d \u201c Poor William ! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp , \u201d was a tender apostrophe of Fanny \u2019s , very much to the purpose of her own feelings if not of the conversation . \u201c I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , \u201d said Miss Crawford , \u201c that I can hardly suppose \u2014 and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant . And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , _ I _ see him to be an indolent , selfish _ bon _ _ vivant _ , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife . To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of . My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it . \u201d \u201c I do not wonder at your disapprobation , upon my word . It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self - indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours . Fanny , it goes against us . We can not attempt to defend Dr. Grant . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d replied Fanny , \u201c but we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a \u2014 not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman . Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation \u2014 where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the _ frequency _ , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now . A man \u2014 a sensible man like Dr. Grant , can not be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week , can not go to church twice every Sunday , and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does , without being the better for it himself . It must make him think ; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman . \u201d \u201c We can not prove to the contrary , to be sure ; but I wish you a better fate , Miss Price , than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons ; for though he may preach himself into a good - humour every Sunday , it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night . \u201d \u201c I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny , \u201d said Edmund affectionately , \u201c must be beyond the reach of any sermons . \u201d Fanny turned farther into the window ; and Miss Crawford had only time to say , in a pleasant manner , \u201c I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it \u201d ; when , being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee , she tripped off to the instrument , leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues , from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread . \u201c There goes good - humour , I am sure , \u201d said he presently . \u201c There goes a temper which would never give pain ! How well she walks ! and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others ! joining them the moment she is asked . What a pity , \u201d he added , after an instant \u2019s reflection , \u201c that she should have been in such hands ! \u201d Fanny agreed to it , and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the window with her , in spite of the expected glee ; and of having his eyes soon turned , like hers , towards the scene without , where all that was solemn , and soothing , and lovely , appeared in the brilliancy of an unclouded night , and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods . Fanny spoke her feelings . \u201c Here \u2019s harmony ! \u201d said she ; \u201c here \u2019s repose ! Here \u2019s what may leave all painting and all music behind , and what poetry only can attempt to describe ! Here \u2019s what may tranquillise every care , and lift the heart to rapture ! When I look out on such a night as this , I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world ; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to , and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene . \u201d \u201c I like to hear your enthusiasm , Fanny . It is a lovely night , and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel , in some degree , as you do ; who have not , at least , been given a taste for Nature in early life . They lose a great deal . \u201d \u201c _ You _ taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . \u201d \u201c I had a very apt scholar . There \u2019s Arcturus looking very bright . \u201d \u201c Yes , and the Bear . I wish I could see Cassiopeia . \u201d \u201c We must go out on the lawn for that . Should you be afraid ? \u201d \u201c Not in the least . It is a great while since we have had any star - gazing . \u201d \u201c Yes ; I do not know how it has happened . \u201d The glee began . \u201c We will stay till this is finished , Fanny , \u201d said he , turning his back on the window ; and as it advanced , she had the mortification of seeing him advance too , moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument , and when it ceased , he was close by the singers , among the most urgent in requesting to hear the glee again . Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris \u2019s threats of catching cold .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [12, 15], "text": "the Miss Bertrams"}, {"position":
