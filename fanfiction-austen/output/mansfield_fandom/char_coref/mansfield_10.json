{"document": "X A quarter of an hour , twenty minutes , passed away , and Fanny was still thinking of Edmund , Miss Crawford , and herself , without interruption from any one . She began to be surprised at being left so long , and to listen with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices again . She listened , and at length she heard ; she heard voices and feet approaching ; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted , when Miss Bertram , Mr. Rushworth , and Mr. Crawford issued from the same path which she had trod herself , and were before her . \u201c Miss Price all alone \u201d and \u201c My dear Fanny , how comes this ? \u201d were the first salutations . She told her story . \u201c Poor dear Fanny , \u201d cried her cousin , \u201c how ill you have been used by them ! You had better have staid with us . \u201d Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side , she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before , and discussed the possibility of improvements with much animation . Nothing was fixed on ; but Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects , and , generally speaking , whatever he proposed was immediately approved , first by her , and then by Mr. Rushworth , whose principal business seemed to be to hear the others , and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith \u2019s place . After some minutes spent in this way , Miss Bertram , observing the iron gate , expressed a wish of passing through it into the park , that their views and their plans might be more comprehensive . It was the very thing of all others to be wished , it was the best , it was the only way of proceeding with any advantage , in Henry Crawford \u2019s opinion ; and he directly saw a knoll not half a mile off , which would give them exactly the requisite command of the house . Go therefore they must to that knoll , and through that gate ; but the gate was locked . Mr. Rushworth wished he had brought the key ; he had been very near thinking whether he should not bring the key ; he was determined he would never come without the key again ; but still this did not remove the present evil . They could not get through ; and as Miss Bertram \u2019s inclination for so doing did by no means lessen , it ended in Mr. Rushworth \u2019s declaring outright that he would go and fetch the key . He set off accordingly . \u201c It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , \u201d said Mr. Crawford , when he was gone . \u201c Yes , there is nothing else to be done . But now , sincerely , do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected ? \u201d \u201c No , indeed , far otherwise . I find it better , grander , more complete in its style , though that style may not be the best . And to tell you the truth , \u201d speaking rather lower , \u201c I do not think that _ I _ shall ever see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now . Another summer will hardly improve it to me . \u201d After a moment \u2019s embarrassment the lady replied , \u201c You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world . If other people think Sotherton improved , I have no doubt that you will . \u201d \u201c I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points . My feelings are not quite so evanescent , nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world . \u201d This was followed by a short silence . Miss Bertram began again . \u201c You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning . I was glad to see you so well entertained . You and Julia were laughing the whole way . \u201d \u201c Were we ? Yes , I believe we were ; but I have not the least recollection at what . Oh ! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my uncle \u2019s . Your sister loves to laugh . \u201d \u201c You think her more light - hearted than I am ? \u201d \u201c More easily amused , \u201d he replied ; \u201c consequently , you know , \u201d smiling , \u201c better company . I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles \u2019 drive . \u201d \u201c Naturally , I believe , I am as lively as Julia , but I have more to think of now . \u201d \u201c You have , undoubtedly ; and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility . Your prospects , however , are too fair to justify want of spirits . You have a very smiling scene before you . \u201d \u201c Do you mean literally or figuratively ? Literally , I conclude . Yes , certainly , the sun shines , and the park looks very cheerful . But unluckily that iron gate , that ha - ha , give me a feeling of restraint and hardship . \u2018 I can not get out , \u2019 as the starling said . \u201d As she spoke , and it was with expression , she walked to the gate : he followed her . \u201c Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching this key ! \u201d \u201c And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr. Rushworth \u2019s authority and protection , or I think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate , here , with my assistance ; I think it might be done , if you really wished to be more at large , and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited . \u201d \u201c Prohibited ! nonsense ! I certainly can get out that way , and I will . Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment , you know ; we shall not be out of sight . \u201d \u201c Or if we are , Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll : the grove of oak on the knoll . \u201d Fanny , feeling all this to be wrong , could not help making an effort to prevent it . \u201c You will hurt yourself , Miss Bertram , \u201d she cried ; \u201c you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes ; you will tear your gown ; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha - ha . You had better not go . \u201d Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken , and , smiling with all the good - humour of success , she said , \u201c Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . \u201d Fanny was again left to her solitude , and with no increase of pleasant feelings , for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard , astonished at Miss Bertram , and angry with Mr. Crawford . By taking a circuitous , and , as it appeared to her , very unreasonable direction to the knoll , they were soon beyond her eye ; and for some minutes longer she remained without sight or sound of any companion . She seemed to have the little wood all to herself . She could almost have thought that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it , but that it was impossible for Edmund to forget her so entirely . She was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps : somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk . She expected Mr. Rushworth , but it was Julia , who , hot and out of breath , and with a look of disappointment , cried out on seeing her , \u201c Heyday ! Where are the others ? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you . \u201d Fanny explained . \u201c A pretty trick , upon my word ! I can not see them anywhere , \u201d looking eagerly into the park . \u201c But they can not be very far off , and I think I am equal to as much as Maria , even without help . \u201d \u201c But , Julia , Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key . Do wait for Mr. Rushworth . \u201d \u201c Not I , indeed . I have had enough of the family for one morning . Why , child , I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother . Such a penance as I have been enduring , while you were sitting here so composed and so happy ! It might have been as well , perhaps , if you had been in my place , but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes . \u201d This was a most unjust reflection , but Fanny could allow for it , and let it pass : Julia was vexed , and her temper was hasty ; but she felt that it would not last , and therefore , taking no notice , only asked her if she had not seen Mr. Rushworth . \u201c Yes , yes , we saw him . He was posting away as if upon life and death , and could but just spare time to tell us his errand , and where you all were . \u201d \u201c It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing . \u201d \u201c _ That _ is Miss Maria \u2019s concern . I am not obliged to punish myself for _ her _ sins . The mother I could not avoid , as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper , but the son I _ can _ get away from . \u201d And she immediately scrambled across the fence , and walked away , not attending to Fanny \u2019s last question of whether she had seen anything of Miss Crawford and Edmund . The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of seeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued absence , however , as she might have done . She felt that he had been very ill - used , and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had passed . He joined her within five minutes after Julia \u2019s exit ; and though she made the best of the story , he was evidently mortified and displeased in no common degree . At first he scarcely said anything ; his looks only expressed his extreme surprise and vexation , and he walked to the gate and stood there , without seeming to know what to do . \u201c They desired me to stay \u2014 my cousin Maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll , or thereabouts . \u201d \u201c I do not believe I shall go any farther , \u201d said he sullenly ; \u201c I see nothing of them . By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else . I have had walking enough . \u201d And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny . \u201c I am very sorry , \u201d said she ; \u201c it is very unlucky . \u201d And she longed to be able to say something more to the purpose . After an interval of silence , \u201c I think they might as well have staid for me , \u201d said he . \u201c Miss Bertram thought you would follow her . \u201d \u201c I should not have had to follow her if she had staid . \u201d This could not be denied , and Fanny was silenced . After another pause , he went on\u2014\u201cPray , Miss Price , are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some people are ? For my part , I can see nothing in him . \u201d \u201c I do not think him at all handsome . \u201d \u201c Handsome ! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome . He is not five foot nine . I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight . I think he is an ill - looking fellow . In my opinion , these Crawfords are no addition at all . We did very well without them . \u201d A small sigh escaped Fanny here , and she did not know how to contradict him . \u201c If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key , there might have been some excuse , but I went the very moment she said she wanted it . \u201d \u201c Nothing could be more obliging than your manner , I am sure , and I dare say you walked as fast as you could ; but still it is some distance , you know , from this spot to the house , quite into the house ; and when people are waiting , they are bad judges of time , and every half minute seems like five . \u201d He got up and walked to the gate again , and \u201c wished he had had the key about him at the time . \u201d Fanny thought she discerned in his standing there an indication of relenting , which encouraged her to another attempt , and she said , therefore , \u201c It is a pity you should not join them . They expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park , and will be thinking how it may be improved ; and nothing of that sort , you know , can be settled without you . \u201d She found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a companion . Mr. Rushworth was worked on . \u201c Well , \u201d said he , \u201c if you really think I had better go : it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing . \u201d And letting himself out , he walked off without farther ceremony . Fanny \u2019s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so long ago , and getting quite impatient , she resolved to go in search of them . She followed their steps along the bottom walk , and had just turned up into another , when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford once more caught her ear ; the sound approached , and a few more windings brought them before her . They were just returned into the wilderness from the park , to which a sidegate , not fastened , had tempted them very soon after their leaving her , and they had been across a portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last , and had been sitting down under one of the trees . This was their history . It was evident that they had been spending their time pleasantly , and were not aware of the length of their absence . Fanny \u2019s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much , and that he should certainly have come back for her , had she not been tired already ; but this was not quite sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour , when he had talked of only a few minutes , nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all that time ; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and depression , as they prepared by general agreement to return to the house . On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace , Mrs. Rushworth and Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top , just ready for the wilderness , at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the house . Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster . Whatever cross - accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces , she had found a morning of complete enjoyment ; for the housekeeper , after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants , had taken her to the dairy , told her all about their cows , and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese ; and since Julia \u2019s leaving them they had been met by the gardener , with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance , for she had set him right as to his grandson \u2019s illness , convinced him that it was an ague , and promised him a charm for it ; and he , in return , had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants , and actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath . On this _ rencontre _ they all returned to the house together , there to lounge away the time as they could with sofas , and chit - chat , and Quarterly Reviews , till the return of the others , and the arrival of dinner . It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came in , and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially agreeable , or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the object of the day . By their own accounts they had been all walking after each other , and the junction which had taken place at last seemed , to Fanny \u2019s observation , to have been as much too late for re - establishing harmony , as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration . She felt , as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth , that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them : there was gloom on the face of each . Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay , and she thought that he was taking particular pains , during dinner , to do away any little resentment of the other two , and restore general good - humour . Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee , a ten miles \u2019 drive home allowed no waste of hours ; and from the time of their sitting down to table , it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came to the door , and Mrs. Norris , having fidgeted about , and obtained a few pheasants \u2019 eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper , and made abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth , was ready to lead the way . At the same moment Mr. Crawford , approaching Julia , said , \u201c I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . \u201d The request had not been foreseen , but was very graciously received , and Julia \u2019s day was likely to end almost as well as it began . Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different , and was a little disappointed ; but her conviction of being really the one preferred comforted her under it , and enabled her to receive Mr. Rushworth \u2019s parting attentions as she ought . He was certainly better pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending the box , and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement . \u201c Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , \u201d said Mrs. Norris , as they drove through the park . \u201c Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end ! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go . A pretty good day \u2019s amusement you have had ! \u201d Maria was just discontented enough to say directly , \u201c I think _ you _ have done pretty well yourself , ma\u2019am . Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . \u201d \u201c My dear , it is only a beautiful little heath , which that nice old gardener would make me take ; but if it is in your way , I will have it in my lap directly . There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner . Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker , but my taking one of the cheeses . I stood out as long as I could , till the tears almost came into her eyes , and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with . That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure ! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table , and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns . Take care of the cheese , Fanny . Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well . \u201d \u201c What else have you been spunging ? \u201d said Maria , half - pleased that Sotherton should be so complimented . \u201c Spunging , my dear ! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants \u2019 eggs , which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me : she would not take a denial . She said it must be such an amusement to me , as she understood I lived quite alone , to have a few living creatures of that sort ; and so to be sure it will . I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen , and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop ; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them . And if I have good luck , your mother shall have some . \u201d It was a beautiful evening , mild and still , and the drive was as pleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it ; but when Mrs. Norris ceased speaking , it was altogether a silent drive to those within . Their spirits were in general exhausted ; and to determine whether the day had afforded most pleasure or pain , might occupy the meditations of almost all .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position":
