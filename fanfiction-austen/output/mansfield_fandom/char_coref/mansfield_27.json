{"document": "XXVII On reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this unexpected acquisition , this doubtful good of a necklace , in some favourite box in the East room , which held all her smaller treasures ; but on opening the door , what was her surprise to find her cousin Edmund there writing at the table ! Such a sight having never occurred before , was almost as wonderful as it was welcome . \u201c Fanny , \u201d said he directly , leaving his seat and his pen , and meeting her with something in his hand , \u201c I beg your pardon for being here . I came to look for you , and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in , was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand . You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle \u2014 a chain for William \u2019s cross . You ought to have had it a week ago , but there has been a delay from my brother \u2019s not being in town by several days so soon as I expected ; and I have only just now received it at Northampton . I hope you will like the chain itself , Fanny . I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste ; but , at any rate , I know you will be kind to my intentions , and consider it , as it really is , a token of the love of one of your oldest friends . \u201d And so saying , he was hurrying away , before Fanny , overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure , could attempt to speak ; but quickened by one sovereign wish , she then called out , \u201c Oh ! cousin , stop a moment , pray stop ! \u201d He turned back . \u201c I can not attempt to thank you , \u201d she continued , in a very agitated manner ; \u201c thanks are out of the question . I feel much more than I can possibly express . Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond \u2014 \u201d \u201c If that is all you have to say , Fanny \u201d smiling and turning away again . \u201c No , no , it is not . I want to consult you . \u201d Almost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he had just put into her hand , and seeing before her , in all the niceness of jewellers \u2019 packing , a plain gold chain , perfectly simple and neat , she could not help bursting forth again , \u201c Oh , this is beautiful indeed ! This is the very thing , precisely what I wished for ! This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess . It will exactly suit my cross . They must and shall be worn together . It comes , too , in such an acceptable moment . Oh , cousin , you do not know how acceptable it is . \u201d \u201c My dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much . I am most happy that you like the chain , and that it should be here in time for to - morrow ; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion . Believe me , I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours . No , I can safely say , I have no pleasure so complete , so unalloyed . It is without a drawback . \u201d Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour without saying another word ; but Edmund , after waiting a moment , obliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying , \u201c But what is it that you want to consult me about ? \u201d It was about the necklace , which she was now most earnestly longing to return , and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing . She gave the history of her recent visit , and now her raptures might well be over ; for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance , so delighted with what Miss Crawford had done , so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between them , that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind , though it might have its drawback . It was some time before she could get his attention to her plan , or any answer to her demand of his opinion : he was in a reverie of fond reflection , uttering only now and then a few half - sentences of praise ; but when he did awake and understand , he was very decided in opposing what she wished . \u201c Return the necklace ! No , my dear Fanny , upon no account . It would be mortifying her severely . There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend . Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of ? \u201d \u201c If it had been given to me in the first instance , \u201d said Fanny , \u201c I should not have thought of returning it ; but being her brother \u2019s present , is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it , when it is not wanted ? \u201d \u201c She must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother \u2019s gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it . No doubt it is handsomer than mine , and fitter for a ballroom . \u201d \u201c No , it is not handsomer , not at all handsomer in its way , and , for my purpose , not half so fit . The chain will agree with William \u2019s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace . \u201d \u201c For one night , Fanny , for only one night , if it _ be _ a sacrifice ; I am sure you will , upon consideration , make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort . Miss Crawford \u2019s attentions to you have been \u2014 not more than you were justly entitled to \u2014 I am the last person to think that _ could _ _ be _ , but they have been invariable ; and to be returning them with what must have something the _ air _ of ingratitude , though I know it could never have the _ meaning _ , is not in your nature , I am sure . Wear the necklace , as you are engaged to do , to - morrow evening , and let the chain , which was not ordered with any reference to the ball , be kept for commoner occasions . This is my advice . I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure , and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences , resulting principally from situation , no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship . I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise , \u201d he repeated , his voice sinking a little , \u201c between the two dearest objects I have on earth . \u201d He was gone as he spoke ; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as she could . She was one of his two dearest \u2014 that must support her . But the other : the first ! She had never heard him speak so openly before , and though it told her no more than what she had long perceived , it was a stab , for it told of his own convictions and views . They were decided . He would marry Miss Crawford . It was a stab , in spite of every long - standing expectation ; and she was obliged to repeat again and again , that she was one of his two dearest , before the words gave her any sensation . Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him , it would be \u2014 oh , how different would it be \u2014 how far more tolerable ! But he was deceived in her : he gave her merits which she had not ; her faults were what they had ever been , but he saw them no longer . Till she had shed many tears over this deception , Fanny could not subdue her agitation ; and the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the influence of fervent prayers for his happiness . It was her intention , as she felt it to be her duty , to try to overcome all that was excessive , all that bordered on selfishness , in her affection for Edmund . To call or to fancy it a loss , a disappointment , would be a presumption for which she had not words strong enough to satisfy her own humility . To think of him as Miss Crawford might be justified in thinking , would in her be insanity . To her he could be nothing under any circumstances ; nothing dearer than a friend . Why did such an idea occur to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden ? It ought not to have touched on the confines of her imagination . She would endeavour to be rational , and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford \u2019s character , and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart . She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self - government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , \u201c My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept \u201d locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift . It was the only thing approaching to a letter which she had ever received from him ; she might never receive another ; it was impossible that she ever should receive another so perfectly gratifying in the occasion and the style . Two lines more prized had never fallen from the pen of the most distinguished author \u2014 never more completely blessed the researches of the fondest biographer . The enthusiasm of a woman \u2019s love is even beyond the biographer \u2019s . To her , the handwriting itself , independent of anything it may convey , is a blessedness . Never were such characters cut by any other human being as Edmund \u2019s commonest handwriting gave ! This specimen , written in haste as it was , had not a fault ; and there was a felicity in the flow of the first four words , in the arrangement of \u201c My very dear Fanny , \u201d which she could have looked at for ever . Having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happy mixture of reason and weakness , she was able in due time to go down and resume her usual employments near her aunt Bertram , and pay her the usual observances without any apparent want of spirits . Thursday , predestined to hope and enjoyment , came ; and opened with more kindness to Fanny than such self - willed , unmanageable days often volunteer , for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought from Mr. Crawford to William , stating that as he found himself obliged to go to London on the morrow for a few days , he could not help trying to procure a companion ; and therefore hoped that if William could make up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed , he would accept a place in his carriage . Mr. Crawford meant to be in town by his uncle \u2019s accustomary late dinner - hour , and William was invited to dine with him at the Admiral \u2019s . The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself , who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses , and such a good - humoured , agreeable friend ; and , in likening it to going up with despatches , was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest ; and Fanny , from a different motive , was exceedingly pleased ; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night , which would not have allowed him an hour \u2019s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach ; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford \u2019s would rob her of many hours of his company , she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey , to think of anything else . Sir Thomas approved of it for another reason . His nephew \u2019s introduction to Admiral Crawford might be of service . The Admiral , he believed , had interest . Upon the whole , it was a very joyous note . Fanny \u2019s spirits lived on it half the morning , deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go away . As for the ball , so near at hand , she had too many agitations and fears to have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she ought to have had , or must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking forward to the same event in situations more at ease , but under circumstances of less novelty , less interest , less peculiar gratification , than would be attributed to her . Miss Price , known only by name to half the people invited , was now to make her first appearance , and must be regarded as the queen of the evening . Who could be happier than Miss Price ? But Miss Price had not been brought up to the trade of _ coming _ _ out _ ; and had she known in what light this ball was , in general , considered respecting her , it would very much have lessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing wrong and being looked at . To dance without much observation or any extraordinary fatigue , to have strength and partners for about half the evening , to dance a little with Edmund , and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford , to see William enjoy himself , and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris , was the height of her ambition , and seemed to comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness . As these were the best of her hopes , they could not always prevail ; and in the course of a long morning , spent principally with her two aunts , she was often under the influence of much less sanguine views . William , determined to make this last day a day of thorough enjoyment , was out snipe - shooting ; Edmund , she had too much reason to suppose , was at the Parsonage ; and left alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris , who was cross because the housekeeper would have her own way with the supper , and whom _ she _ could not avoid though the housekeeper might , Fanny was worn down at last to think everything an evil belonging to the ball , and when sent off with a parting worry to dress , moved as languidly towards her own room , and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in it . As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday ; it had been about the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage , and found Edmund in the East room . \u201c Suppose I were to find him there again to - day ! \u201d said she to herself , in a fond indulgence of fancy . \u201c Fanny , \u201d said a voice at that moment near her . Starting and looking up , she saw , across the lobby she had just reached , Edmund himself , standing at the head of a different staircase . He came towards her . \u201c You look tired and fagged , Fanny . You have been walking too far . \u201d \u201c No , I have not been out at all . \u201d \u201c Then you have had fatigues within doors , which are worse . You had better have gone out . \u201d Fanny , not liking to complain , found it easiest to make no answer ; and though he looked at her with his usual kindness , she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance . He did not appear in spirits : something unconnected with her was probably amiss . They proceeded upstairs together , their rooms being on the same floor above . \u201c I come from Dr. Grant \u2019s , \u201d said Edmund presently . \u201c You may guess my errand there , Fanny . \u201d And he looked so conscious , that Fanny could think but of one errand , which turned her too sick for speech . \u201c I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , \u201d was the explanation that followed , and brought Fanny to life again , enabling her , as she found she was expected to speak , to utter something like an inquiry as to the result . \u201c Yes , \u201d he answered , \u201c she is engaged to me ; but \u201d ( with a smile that did not sit easy ) \u201c she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me . She is not serious . I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it . She never has danced with a clergyman , she says , and she never _ will _ . For my own sake , I could wish there had been no ball just at \u2014 I mean not this very week , this very day ; to - morrow I leave home . \u201d Fanny struggled for speech , and said , \u201c I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you . This ought to be a day of pleasure . My uncle meant it so . \u201d \u201c Oh yes , yes ! and it will be a day of pleasure . It will all end right . I am only vexed for a moment . In fact , it is not that I consider the ball as ill - timed ; what does it signify ? But , Fanny , \u201d stopping her , by taking her hand , and speaking low and seriously , \u201c you know what all this means . You see how it is ; and could tell me , perhaps better than I could tell you , how and why I am vexed . Let me talk to you a little . You are a kind , kind listener . I have been pained by her manner this morning , and can not get the better of it . I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own , but the influence of her former companions makes her seem \u2014 gives to her conversation , to her professed opinions , sometimes a tinge of wrong . She does not _ think _ evil , but she speaks it , speaks it in playfulness ; and though I know it to be playfulness , it grieves me to the soul . \u201d \u201c The effect of education , \u201d said Fanny gently . Edmund could not but agree to it . \u201c Yes , that uncle and aunt ! They have injured the finest mind ; for sometimes , Fanny , I own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted . \u201d Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment , and therefore , after a moment \u2019s consideration , said , \u201c If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . Do not ask advice of _ me _ . I am not competent . \u201d \u201c You are right , Fanny , to protest against such an office , but you need not be afraid . It is a subject on which I should never ask advice ; it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked ; and few , I imagine , do ask it , but when they want to be influenced against their conscience . I only want to talk to you . \u201d \u201c One thing more . Excuse the liberty ; but take care _ how _ you talk to me . Do not tell me anything now , which hereafter you may be sorry for . The time may come \u2014 \u201d The colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke . \u201c Dearest Fanny ! \u201d cried Edmund , pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford \u2019s , \u201c you are all considerate thought ! But it is unnecessary here . The time will never come . No such time as you allude to will ever come . I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had . You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded . How many a time have we talked over her little errors ! You need not fear me ; I have almost given up every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . \u201d He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen . He had said enough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known , and with a brighter look , she answered , \u201c Yes , cousin , I am convinced that _ you _ would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not . I can not be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say . Do not check yourself . Tell me whatever you like . \u201d They were now on the second floor , and the appearance of a housemaid prevented any farther conversation . For Fanny \u2019s present comfort it was concluded , perhaps , at the happiest moment : had he been able to talk another five minutes , there is no saying that he might not have talked away all Miss Crawford \u2019s faults and his own despondence . But as it was , they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection , and with some very precious sensations on hers . She had felt nothing like it for hours . Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford \u2019s note to William had worn away , she had been in a state absolutely the reverse ; there had been no comfort around , no hope within her . Now everything was smiling . William \u2019s good fortune returned again upon her mind , and seemed of greater value than at first . The ball , too \u2014 such an evening of pleasure before her ! It was now a real animation ; and she began to dress for it with much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball . All went well : she did not dislike her own looks ; and when she came to the necklaces again , her good fortune seemed complete , for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross . She had , to oblige Edmund , resolved to wear it ; but it was too large for the purpose . His , therefore , must be worn ; and having , with delightful feelings , joined the chain and the cross \u2014 those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart , those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary \u2014 and put them round her neck , and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were , she was able , without an effort , to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford \u2019s necklace too . She acknowledged it to be right . Miss Crawford had a claim ; and when it was no longer to encroach on , to interfere with the stronger claims , the truer kindness of another , she could do her justice even with pleasure to herself . The necklace really looked very well ; and Fanny left her room at last , comfortably satisfied with herself and all about her . Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual degree of wakefulness . It had really occurred to her , unprompted , that Fanny , preparing for a ball , might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid \u2019s , and when dressed herself , she actually sent her own maid to assist her ; too late , of course , to be of any use . Mrs. Chapman had just reached the attic floor , when Miss Price came out of her room completely dressed , and only civilities were necessary ; but Fanny felt her aunt \u2019s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do themselves .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [4, 5], "text": "Fanny"}, {"position": [33, 34], "text": "her"}, {"position": [45, 46], "text": "her"},
