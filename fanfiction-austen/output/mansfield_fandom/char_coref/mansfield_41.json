{"document": "XLI A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town , and Fanny had heard nothing of him . There were three different conclusions to be drawn from his silence , between which her mind was in fluctuation ; each of them at times being held the most probable . Either his going had been again delayed , or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone , or he was too happy for letter - writing ! One morning , about this time , Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield , a point which she never failed to think over and calculate every day , as she and Susan were preparing to remove , as usual , upstairs , they were stopped by the knock of a visitor , whom they felt they could not avoid , from Rebecca \u2019s alertness in going to the door , a duty which always interested her beyond any other . It was a gentleman \u2019s voice ; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning pale about , when Mr. Crawford walked into the room . Good sense , like hers , will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name , as that of \u201c William \u2019s friend , \u201d though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment . The consciousness of his being known there only as William \u2019s friend was some support . Having introduced him , however , and being all reseated , the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead to were overpowering , and she fancied herself on the point of fainting away . While trying to keep herself alive , their visitor , who had at first approached her with as animated a countenance as ever , was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away , and giving her time to recover , while he devoted himself entirely to her mother , addressing her , and attending to her with the utmost politeness and propriety , at the same time with a degree of friendliness , of interest at least , which was making his manner perfect . Mrs. Price \u2019s manners were also at their best . Warmed by the sight of such a friend to her son , and regulated by the wish of appearing to advantage before him , she was overflowing with gratitude \u2014 artless , maternal gratitude \u2014 which could not be unpleasing . Mr. Price was out , which she regretted very much . Fanny was just recovered enough to feel that _ she _ could not regret it ; for to her many other sources of uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he found her . She might scold herself for the weakness , but there was no scolding it away . She was ashamed , and she would have been yet more ashamed of her father than of all the rest . They talked of William , a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire ; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish . She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life ; and was only astonished to find that , so great and so agreeable as he was , he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port - admiral , nor the commissioner , nor yet with the intention of going over to the island , nor of seeing the dockyard . Nothing of all that she had been used to think of as the proof of importance , or the employment of wealth , had brought him to Portsmouth . He had reached it late the night before , was come for a day or two , was staying at the Crown , had accidentally met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since his arrival , but had no object of that kind in coming . By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers . Fanny listened collectedly , even to the last - mentioned circumstance ; nay , it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty ; and the words , \u201c then by this time it is all settled , \u201d passed internally , without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush . After talking a little more about Mansfield , a subject in which her interest was most apparent , Crawford began to hint at the expediency of an early walk . \u201c It was a lovely morning , and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off , that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise \u201d ; and such hints producing nothing , he soon proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her daughters to take their walk without loss of time . Now they came to an understanding . Mrs. Price , it appeared , scarcely ever stirred out of doors , except of a Sunday ; she owned she could seldom , with her large family , find time for a walk . \u201c Would she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? \u201d Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying . \u201c Her daughters were very much confined ; Portsmouth was a sad place ; they did not often get out ; and she knew they had some errands in the town , which they would be very glad to do . \u201d And the consequence was , that Fanny , strange as it was \u2014 strange , awkward , and distressing \u2014 found herself and Susan , within ten minutes , walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford . It was soon pain upon pain , confusion upon confusion ; for they were hardly in the High Street before they met her father , whose appearance was not the better from its being Saturday . He stopt ; and , ungentlemanlike as he looked , Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford . She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford must be struck . He must be ashamed and disgusted altogether . He must soon give her up , and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match ; and yet , though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured , this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint ; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever , agreeable man , than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations . Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father - in - law with any idea of taking him for a model in dress ; but ( as Fanny instantly , and to her great relief , discerned ) her father was a very different man , a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected stranger , from what he was in his own family at home . His manners now , though not polished , were more than passable : they were grateful , animated , manly ; his expressions were those of an attached father , and a sensible man ; his loud tones did very well in the open air , and there was not a single oath to be heard . Such was his instinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford ; and , be the consequence what it might , Fanny \u2019s immediate feelings were infinitely soothed . The conclusion of the two gentlemen \u2019s civilities was an offer of Mr. Price \u2019s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard , which Mr. Crawford , desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such , though he had seen the dockyard again and again , and hoping to be so much the longer with Fanny , was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of , if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue ; and as it was somehow or other ascertained , or inferred , or at least acted upon , that they were not at all afraid , to the dockyard they were all to go ; and but for Mr. Crawford , Mr. Price would have turned thither directly , without the smallest consideration for his daughters \u2019 errands in the High Street . He took care , however , that they should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly to visit ; and it did not delay them long , for Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience , or be waited for , that before the gentlemen , as they stood at the door , could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations , or settle the number of three - deckers now in commission , their companions were ready to proceed . They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once , and the walk would have been conducted \u2014 according to Mr. Crawford \u2019s opinion \u2014 in a singular manner , had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it , as the two girls , he found , would have been left to follow , and keep up with them or not , as they could , while they walked on together at their own hasty pace . He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally , though by no means to the extent he wished ; he absolutely would not walk away from them ; and at any crossing or any crowd , when Mr. Price was only calling out , \u201c Come , girls ; come , Fan ; come , Sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! \u201d he would give them his particular attendance . Once fairly in the dockyard , he began to reckon upon some happy intercourse with Fanny , as they were very soon joined by a brother lounger of Mr. Price \u2019s , who was come to take his daily survey of how things went on , and who must prove a far more worthy companion than himself ; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied going about together , and discussing matters of equal and never - failing interest , while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard , or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at . Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest . Crawford could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down ; but he could have wished her sister away . A quick - looking girl of Susan \u2019s age was the very worst third in the world : totally different from Lady Bertram , all eyes and ears ; and there was no introducing the main point before her . He must content himself with being only generally agreeable , and letting Susan have her share of entertainment , with the indulgence , now and then , of a look or hint for the better - informed and conscious Fanny . Norfolk was what he had mostly to talk of : there he had been some time , and everything there was rising in importance from his present schemes . Such a man could come from no place , no society , without importing something to amuse ; his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use , and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her . For Fanny , somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness of the parties he had been in . For her approbation , the particular reason of his going into Norfolk at all , at this unusual time of year , was given . It had been real business , relative to the renewal of a lease in which the welfare of a large and \u2014 he believed \u2014 industrious family was at stake . He had suspected his agent of some underhand dealing ; of meaning to bias him against the deserving ; and he had determined to go himself , and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case . He had gone , had done even more good than he had foreseen , had been useful to more than his first plan had comprehended , and was now able to congratulate himself upon it , and to feel that in performing a duty , he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind . He had introduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before ; he had begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence , though on his own estate , had been hitherto unknown to him . This was aimed , and well aimed , at Fanny . It was pleasing to hear him speak so properly ; here he had been acting as he ought to do . To be the friend of the poor and the oppressed ! Nothing could be more grateful to her ; and she was on the point of giving him an approving look , when it was all frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of his hoping soon to have an assistant , a friend , a guide in every plan of utility or charity for Everingham : a somebody that would make Everingham and all about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet . She turned away , and wished he would not say such things . She was willing to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been wo nt to suppose . She began to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last ; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her , and ought not to think of her . He perceived that enough had been said of Everingham , and that it would be as well to talk of something else , and turned to Mansfield . He could not have chosen better ; that was a topic to bring back her attention and her looks almost instantly . It was a real indulgence to her to hear or to speak of Mansfield . Now so long divided from everybody who knew the place , she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it , and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts , and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium , in speaking of her uncle as all that was clever and good , and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet tempers . He had a great attachment to Mansfield himself ; he said so ; he looked forward with the hope of spending much , very much , of his time there ; always there , or in the neighbourhood . He particularly built upon a very happy summer and autumn there this year ; he felt that it would be so : he depended upon it ; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the last . As animated , as diversified , as social , but with circumstances of superiority undescribable . \u201c Mansfield , Sotherton , Thornton Lacey , \u201d he continued ; \u201c what a society will be comprised in those houses ! And at Michaelmas , perhaps , a fourth may be added : some small hunting - box in the vicinity of everything so dear ; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey , as Edmund Bertram once good - humouredly proposed , I hope I foresee two objections : two fair , excellent , irresistible objections to that plan . \u201d Fanny was doubly silenced here ; though when the moment was passed , could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning , and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and Edmund . It was a subject which she must learn to speak of , and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon be quite unpardonable . When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished , or had time for , the others were ready to return ; and in the course of their walk back , Mr. Crawford contrived a minute \u2019s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people \u2019s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable \u2014 so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved . She wished the next day over , she wished he had come only for one day ; but it was not so very bad as she would have expected : the pleasure of talking of Mansfield was so very great ! Before they parted , she had to thank him for another pleasure , and one of no trivial kind . Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his mutton with them , and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror , before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement . He was engaged to dinner already both for that day and the next ; he had met with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied ; he should have the honour , however , of waiting on them again on the morrow , etc . , and so they parted \u2014 Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible an evil ! To have had him join their family dinner - party , and see all their deficiencies , would have been dreadful ! Rebecca \u2019s cookery and Rebecca \u2019s waiting , and Betsey \u2019s eating at table without restraint , and pulling everything about as she chose , were what Fanny herself was not yet enough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal . _ She _ was nice only from natural delicacy , but _ he _ had been brought up in a school of luxury and epicurism .", "clusters": [{"mentions":
