{"document": "XLII The Prices were just setting off for church the next day when Mr. Crawford appeared again . He came , not to stop , but to join them ; he was asked to go with them to the Garrison chapel , which was exactly what he had intended , and they all walked thither together . The family were now seen to advantage . Nature had given them no inconsiderable share of beauty , and every Sunday dressed them in their cleanest skins and best attire . Sunday always brought this comfort to Fanny , and on this Sunday she felt it more than ever . Her poor mother now did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram \u2019s sister as she was but too apt to look . It often grieved her to the heart to think of the contrast between them ; to think that where nature had made so little difference , circumstances should have made so much , and that her mother , as handsome as Lady Bertram , and some years her junior , should have an appearance so much more worn and faded , so comfortless , so slatternly , so shabby . But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerably cheerful - looking Mrs. Price , coming abroad with a fine family of children , feeling a little respite of her weekly cares , and only discomposed if she saw her boys run into danger , or Rebecca pass by with a flower in her hat . In chapel they were obliged to divide , but Mr. Crawford took care not to be divided from the female branch ; and after chapel he still continued with them , and made one in the family party on the ramparts . Mrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday throughout the year , always going directly after morning service and staying till dinner - time . It was her public place : there she met her acquaintance , heard a little news , talked over the badness of the Portsmouth servants , and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing . Thither they now went ; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss Prices as his peculiar charge ; and before they had been there long , somehow or other , there was no saying how , Fanny could not have believed it , but he was walking between them with an arm of each under his , and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it . It made her uncomfortable for a time , but yet there were enjoyments in the day and in the view which would be felt . The day was uncommonly lovely . It was really March ; but it was April in its mild air , brisk soft wind , and bright sun , occasionally clouded for a minute ; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of such a sky , the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships at Spithead and the island beyond , with the ever - varying hues of the sea , now at high water , dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts with so fine a sound , produced altogether such a combination of charms for Fanny , as made her gradually almost careless of the circumstances under which she felt them . Nay , had she been without his arm , she would soon have known that she needed it , for she wanted strength for a two hours \u2019 saunter of this kind , coming , as it generally did , upon a week \u2019s previous inactivity . Fanny was beginning to feel the effect of being debarred from her usual regular exercise ; she had lost ground as to health since her being in Portsmouth ; and but for Mr. Crawford and the beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up now . The loveliness of the day , and of the view , he felt like herself . They often stopt with the same sentiment and taste , leaning against the wall , some minutes , to look and admire ; and considering he was not Edmund , Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the charms of nature , and very well able to express his admiration . She had a few tender reveries now and then , which he could sometimes take advantage of to look in her face without detection ; and the result of these looks was , that though as bewitching as ever , her face was less blooming than it ought to be . She _ said _ she was very well , and did not like to be supposed otherwise ; but take it all in all , he was convinced that her present residence could not be comfortable , and therefore could not be salutary for her , and he was growing anxious for her being again at Mansfield , where her own happiness , and his in seeing her , must be so much greater . \u201c You have been here a month , I think ? \u201d said he . \u201c No ; not quite a month . It is only four weeks to - morrow since I left Mansfield . \u201d \u201c You are a most accurate and honest reckoner . I should call that a month . \u201d \u201c I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening . \u201d \u201c And it is to be a two months \u2019 visit , is not ? \u201d \u201c Yes . My uncle talked of two months . I suppose it will not be less . \u201d \u201c And how are you to be conveyed back again ? Who comes for you ? \u201d \u201c I do not know . I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt . Perhaps I may be to stay longer . It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months \u2019 end . \u201d After a moment \u2019s reflection , Mr. Crawford replied , \u201c I know Mansfield , I know its way , I know its faults towards _ you _ . I know the danger of your being so far forgotten , as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family . I am aware that you may be left here week after week , if Sir Thomas can not settle everything for coming himself , or sending your aunt \u2019s maid for you , without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year . This will not do . Two months is an ample allowance ; I should think six weeks quite enough . I am considering your sister \u2019s health , \u201d said he , addressing himself to Susan , \u201c which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to . She requires constant air and exercise . When you know her as well as I do , I am sure you will agree that she does , and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country . If , therefore \u201d ( turning again to Fanny ) , \u201c you find yourself growing unwell , and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield , without waiting for the two months to be ended , _ that _ must not be regarded as of any consequence , if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual , and will only let my sister know it , give her only the slightest hint , she and I will immediately come down , and take you back to Mansfield . You know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done . You know all that would be felt on the occasion . \u201d Fanny thanked him , but tried to laugh it off . \u201c I am perfectly serious , \u201d he replied , \u201c as you perfectly know . And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition . Indeed , you shall _ not _ ; it shall not be in your power ; for so long only as you positively say , in every letter to Mary , \u2018 I am well , \u2019 and I know you can not speak or write a falsehood , so long only shall you be considered as well . \u201d Fanny thanked him again , but was affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much , or even to be certain of what she ought to say . This was towards the close of their walk . He attended them to the last , and left them only at the door of their own house , when he knew them to be going to dinner , and therefore pretended to be waited for elsewhere . \u201c I wish you were not so tired , \u201d said he , still detaining Fanny after all the others were in the house\u2014\u201cI wish I left you in stronger health . Is there anything I can do for you in town ? I have half an idea of going into Norfolk again soon . I am not satisfied about Maddison . I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible , and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill , which I design for somebody else . I must come to an understanding with him . I must make him know that I will not be tricked on the south side of Everingham , any more than on the north : that I will be master of my own property . I was not explicit enough with him before . The mischief such a man does on an estate , both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor , is inconceivable . I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly , and put everything at once on such a footing as can not be afterwards swerved from . Maddison is a clever fellow ; I do not wish to displace him , provided he does not try to displace _ me _ ; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me , and worse than simple to let him give me a hard - hearted , griping fellow for a tenant , instead of an honest man , to whom I have given half a promise already . Would it not be worse than simple ? Shall I go ? Do you advise it ? \u201d \u201c I advise ! You know very well what is right . \u201d \u201c Yes . When you give me your opinion , I always know what is right . Your judgment is my rule of right . \u201d \u201c Oh , no ! do not say so . We have all a better guide in ourselves , if we would attend to it , than any other person can be . Good - bye ; I wish you a pleasant journey to - morrow . \u201d \u201c Is there nothing I can do for you in town ? \u201d \u201c Nothing ; I am much obliged to you . \u201d \u201c Have you no message for anybody ? \u201d \u201c My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . \u201d \u201c Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . \u201d He could say no more , for Fanny would be no longer detained . He pressed her hand , looked at her , and was gone . _ He _ went to while away the next three hours as he could , with his other acquaintance , till the best dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment , and _ she _ turned in to her more simple one immediately . Their general fare bore a very different character ; and could he have suspected how many privations , besides that of exercise , she endured in her father \u2019s house , he would have wondered that her looks were not much more affected than he found them . She was so little equal to Rebecca \u2019s puddings and Rebecca \u2019s hashes , brought to table , as they all were , with such accompaniments of half - cleaned plates , and not half - cleaned knives and forks , that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns . After being nursed up at Mansfield , it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth ; and though Sir Thomas , had he known all , might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved , both mind and body , into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford \u2019s good company and good fortune , he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther , lest she might die under the cure . Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day . Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again , she could not help being low . It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend ; and though , in one light , glad to have him gone , it seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody ; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield ; and she could not think of his returning to town , and being frequently with Mary and Edmund , without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having them . Her dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her ; a friend or two of her father \u2019s , as always happened if he was not with them , spent the long , long evening there ; and from six o\u2019clock till half - past nine , there was little intermission of noise or grog . She was very low . The wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr. Crawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within the current of her thoughts . Not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him , nor how much might be owing to contrast , she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others than formerly . And , if in little things , must it not be so in great ? So anxious for her health and comfort , so very feeling as he now expressed himself , and really seemed , might not it be fairly supposed that he would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her ?", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [13, 15], "text": "Mr. Crawford"}, {"position": [18, 19], "text": "He"}, {"position": [30, 31], "text": "he"}, {"position": [46, 47],
