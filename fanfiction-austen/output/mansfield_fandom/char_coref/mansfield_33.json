{"document": "XXXIII The conference was neither so short nor so conclusive as the lady had designed . The gentleman was not so easily satisfied . He had all the disposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him . He had vanity , which strongly inclined him in the first place to think she did love him , though she might not know it herself ; and which , secondly , when constrained at last to admit that she did know her own present feelings , convinced him that he should be able in time to make those feelings what he wished . He was in love , very much in love ; and it was a love which , operating on an active , sanguine spirit , of more warmth than delicacy , made her affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld , and determined him to have the glory , as well as the felicity , of forcing her to love him . He would not despair : he would not desist . He had every well - grounded reason for solid attachment ; he knew her to have all the worth that could justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her ; her conduct at this very time , by speaking the disinterestedness and delicacy of her character ( qualities which he believed most rare indeed ) , was of a sort to heighten all his wishes , and confirm all his resolutions . He knew not that he had a pre - engaged heart to attack . Of _ that _ he had no suspicion . He considered her rather as one who had never thought on the subject enough to be in danger ; who had been guarded by youth , a youth of mind as lovely as of person ; whose modesty had prevented her from understanding his attentions , and who was still overpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected , and the novelty of a situation which her fancy had never taken into account . Must it not follow of course , that , when he was understood , he should succeed ? He believed it fully . Love such as his , in a man like himself , must with perseverance secure a return , and at no great distance ; and he had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a very short time , that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted . A little difficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford . He rather derived spirits from it . He had been apt to gain hearts too easily . His situation was new and animating . To Fanny , however , who had known too much opposition all her life to find any charm in it , all this was unintelligible . She found that he did mean to persevere ; but how he could , after such language from her as she felt herself obliged to use , was not to be understood . She told him that she did not love him , could not love him , was sure she never should love him ; that such a change was quite impossible ; that the subject was most painful to her ; that she must entreat him never to mention it again , to allow her to leave him at once , and let it be considered as concluded for ever . And when farther pressed , had added , that in her opinion their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affection incompatible ; and that they were unfitted for each other by nature , education , and habit . All this she had said , and with the earnestness of sincerity ; yet this was not enough , for he immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their characters , or anything unfriendly in their situations ; and positively declared , that he would still love , and still hope ! Fanny knew her own meaning , but was no judge of her own manner . Her manner was incurably gentle ; and she was not aware how much it concealed the sternness of her purpose . Her diffidence , gratitude , and softness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of self - denial ; seem , at least , to be giving nearly as much pain to herself as to him . Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who , as the clandestine , insidious , treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram , had been her abhorrence , whom she had hated to see or to speak to , in whom she could believe no good quality to exist , and whose power , even of being agreeable , she had barely acknowledged . He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent , disinterested love ; whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and upright , whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment ; who was pouring out his sense of her merits , describing and describing again his affection , proving as far as words could prove it , and in the language , tone , and spirit of a man of talent too , that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness ; and to complete the whole , he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William \u2019s promotion ! Here was a change , and here were claims which could not but operate ! She might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue , in the grounds of Sotherton , or the theatre at Mansfield Park ; but he approached her now with rights that demanded different treatment . She must be courteous , and she must be compassionate . She must have a sensation of being honoured , and whether thinking of herself or her brother , she must have a strong feeling of gratitude . The effect of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated , and words intermingled with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern , that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford \u2019s , the truth , or at least the strength of her indifference , might well be questionable ; and he was not so irrational as Fanny considered him , in the professions of persevering , assiduous , and not desponding attachment which closed the interview . It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go ; but there was no look of despair in parting to belie his words , or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he professed himself . Now she was angry . Some resentment did arise at a perseverance so selfish and ungenerous . Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her . Here was again a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before . How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity where his own pleasure was concerned \u2014 And , alas ! how always known no principle to supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in . Had her own affections been as free \u2014 as perhaps they ought to have been \u2014 he never could have engaged them . So thought Fanny , in good truth and sober sadness , as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs : wondering at the past and present ; wondering at what was yet to come , and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford , and the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it . Sir Thomas was obliged , or obliged himself , to wait till the morrow for a knowledge of what had passed between the young people . He then saw Mr. Crawford , and received his account . The first feeling was disappointment : he had hoped better things ; he had thought that an hour \u2019s entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so little change on a gentle - tempered girl like Fanny ; but there was speedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover ; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal , Sir Thomas was soon able to depend on it himself . Nothing was omitted , on his side , of civility , compliment , or kindness , that might assist the plan . Mr. Crawford \u2019s steadiness was honoured , and Fanny was praised , and the connexion was still the most desirable in the world . At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome ; he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of his visits , at present or in future . In all his niece \u2019s family and friends , there could be but one opinion , one wish on the subject ; the influence of all who loved her must incline one way . Everything was said that could encourage , every encouragement received with grateful joy , and the gentlemen parted the best of friends . Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and hopeful , Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity with his niece , and to shew no open interference . Upon her disposition he believed kindness might be the best way of working . Entreaty should be from one quarter only . The forbearance of her family on a point , respecting which she could be in no doubt of their wishes , might be their surest means of forwarding it . Accordingly , on this principle , Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her , with a mild gravity , intended to be overcoming , \u201c Well , Fanny , I have seen Mr. Crawford again , and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you . He is a most extraordinary young man , and whatever be the event , you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character ; though , young as you are , and little acquainted with the transient , varying , unsteady nature of love , as it generally exists , you can not be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement . With him it is entirely a matter of feeling : he claims no merit in it ; perhaps is entitled to none . Yet , having chosen so well , his constancy has a respectable stamp . Had his choice been less unexceptionable , I should have condemned his persevering . \u201d \u201c Indeed , sir , \u201d said Fanny , \u201c I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to \u2014 I know that it is paying me a very great compliment , and I feel most undeservedly honoured ; but I am so perfectly convinced , and I have told him so , that it never will be in my power \u2014 \u201d \u201c My dear , \u201d interrupted Sir Thomas , \u201c there is no occasion for this . Your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you . There is nothing more to be said or done . From this hour the subject is never to be revived between us . You will have nothing to fear , or to be agitated about . You can not suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations . Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford \u2019s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his . He proceeds at his own risk . You are on safe ground . I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred . You will see him with the rest of us , in the same manner , and , as much as you can , dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant . He leaves Northamptonshire so soon , that even this slight sacrifice can not be often demanded . The future must be very uncertain . And now , my dear Fanny , this subject is closed between us . \u201d The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much satisfaction . Her uncle \u2019s kind expressions , however , and forbearing manner , were sensibly felt ; and when she considered how much of the truth was unknown to him , she believed she had no right to wonder at the line of conduct he pursued . He , who had married a daughter to Mr. Rushworth : romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him . She must do her duty , and trust that time might make her duty easier than it now was . She could not , though only eighteen , suppose Mr. Crawford \u2019s attachment would hold out for ever ; she could not but imagine that steady , unceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time . How much time she might , in her own fancy , allot for its dominion , is another concern . It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady \u2019s exact estimate of her own perfections . In spite of his intended silence , Sir Thomas found himself once more obliged to mention the subject to his niece , to prepare her briefly for its being imparted to her aunts ; a measure which he would still have avoided , if possible , but which became necessary from the totally opposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding . He had no idea of concealment . It was all known at the Parsonage , where he loved to talk over the future with both his sisters , and it would be rather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress of his success . When Sir Thomas understood this , he felt the necessity of making his own wife and sister - in - law acquainted with the business without delay ; though , on Fanny \u2019s account , he almost dreaded the effect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself . He deprecated her mistaken but well - meaning zeal . Sir Thomas , indeed , was , by this time , not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those well - meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things . Mrs. Norris , however , relieved him . He pressed for the strictest forbearance and silence towards their niece ; she not only promised , but did observe it . She only looked her increased ill - will . Angry she was : bitterly angry ; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received such an offer than for refusing it . It was an injury and affront to Julia , who ought to have been Mr. Crawford \u2019s choice ; and , independently of that , she disliked Fanny , because she had neglected her ; and she would have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always trying to depress . Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than she deserved ; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to see her displeasure , and not to hear it . Lady Bertram took it differently . She had been a beauty , and a prosperous beauty , all her life ; and beauty and wealth were all that excited her respect . To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune , raised her , therefore , very much in her opinion . By convincing her that Fanny _ was _ very pretty , which she had been doubting about before , and that she would be advantageously married , it made her feel a sort of credit in calling her niece . \u201c Well , Fanny , \u201d said she , as soon as they were alone together afterwards , and she really had known something like impatience to be alone with her , and her countenance , as she spoke , had extraordinary animation ; \u201c Well , Fanny , I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning . I must just speak of it _ once _ , I told Sir Thomas I must _ once _ , and then I shall have done . I give you joy , my dear niece . \u201d And looking at her complacently , she added , \u201c Humph , we certainly are a handsome family ! \u201d Fanny coloured , and doubted at first what to say ; when , hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side , she presently answered \u2014 \u201c My dear aunt , _ you _ can not wish me to do differently from what I have done , I am sure . _ You _ can not wish me to marry ; for you would miss me , should not you ? Yes , I am sure you would miss me too much for that . \u201d \u201c No , my dear , I should not think of missing you , when such an offer as this comes in your way . I could do very well without you , if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford . And you must be aware , Fanny , that it is every young woman \u2019s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this . \u201d This was almost the only rule of conduct , the only piece of advice , which Fanny had ever received from her aunt in the course of eight years and a half . It silenced her . She felt how unprofitable contention would be . If her aunt \u2019s feelings were against her , nothing could be hoped from attacking her understanding . Lady Bertram was quite talkative . \u201c I will tell you what , Fanny , \u201d said she , \u201c I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball ; I am sure the mischief was done that evening . You did look remarkably well . Everybody said so . Sir Thomas said so . And you know you had Chapman to help you to dress . I am very glad I sent Chapman to you . I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening . \u201d And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts , she soon afterwards added , \u201c And I will tell you what , Fanny , which is more than I did for Maria : the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 13], "text": "the lady"}, {"position": [16, 18], "text": "The
