{"document": "VIII Fanny \u2019s rides recommenced the very next day ; and as it was a pleasant fresh - feeling morning , less hot than the weather had lately been , Edmund trusted that her losses , both of health and pleasure , would be soon made good . While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived , escorting his mother , who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially , in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton , which had been started a fortnight before , and which , in consequence of her subsequent absence from home , had since lain dormant . Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all well pleased with its revival , and an early day was named and agreed to , provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged : the young ladies did not forget that stipulation , and though Mrs. Norris would willingly have answered for his being so , they would neither authorise the liberty nor run the risk ; and at last , on a hint from Miss Bertram , Mr. Rushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down to the Parsonage directly , and call on Mr. Crawford , and inquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not . Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in . Having been out some time , and taken a different route to the house , they had not met him . Comfortable hopes , however , were given that he would find Mr. Crawford at home . The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course . It was hardly possible , indeed , that anything else should be talked of , for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it ; and Mrs. Rushworth , a well - meaning , civil , prosing , pompous woman , who thought nothing of consequence , but as it related to her own and her son \u2019s concerns , had not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party . Lady Bertram constantly declined it ; but her placid manner of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come , till Mrs. Norris \u2019s more numerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth . \u201c The fatigue would be too much for my sister , a great deal too much , I assure you , my dear Mrs. Rushworth . Ten miles there , and ten back , you know . You must excuse my sister on this occasion , and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her . Sotherton is the only place that could give her a _ wish _ to go so far , but it can not be , indeed . She will have a companion in Fanny Price , you know , so it will all do very well ; and as for Edmund , as he is not here to speak for himself , I will answer for his being most happy to join the party . He can go on horseback , you know . \u201d Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram \u2019s staying at home , could only be sorry . \u201c The loss of her ladyship \u2019s company would be a great drawback , and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too , Miss Price , who had never been at Sotherton yet , and it was a pity she should not see the place . \u201d \u201c You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , \u201d cried Mrs. Norris ; \u201c but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . She has time enough before her ; and her going now is quite out of the question . Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her . \u201d \u201c Oh no ! I can not do without Fanny . \u201d Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next , under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton , to include Miss Crawford in the invitation ; and though Mrs. Grant , who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth , on her coming into the neighbourhood , civilly declined it on her own account , she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister ; and Mary , properly pressed and persuaded , was not long in accepting her share of the civility . Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful ; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled for Wednesday , to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her carriage , and walk half - way down the park with the two other ladies . On his return to the breakfast - room , he found Mrs. Norris trying to make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford \u2019s being of the party were desirable or not , or whether her brother \u2019s barouche would not be full without her . The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea , assuring her that the barouche would hold four perfectly well , independent of the box , on which _ one _ might go with him . \u201c But why is it necessary , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c that Crawford \u2019s carriage , or his _ only _ , should be employed ? Why is no use to be made of my mother \u2019s chaise ? I could not , when the scheme was first mentioned the other day , understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family . \u201d \u201c What ! \u201d cried Julia : \u201c go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather , when we may have seats in a barouche ! No , my dear Edmund , that will not quite do . \u201d \u201c Besides , \u201d said Maria , \u201c I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us . After what passed at first , he would claim it as a promise . \u201d \u201c And , my dear Edmund , \u201d added Mrs. Norris , \u201c taking out _ two _ carriages when _ one _ will do , would be trouble for nothing ; and , between ourselves , coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton : he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage , and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas , when he comes home , find all the varnish scratched off . \u201d \u201c That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford \u2019s , \u201d said Maria ; \u201c but the truth is , that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow , and does not know how to drive . I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday . \u201d \u201c There is no hardship , I suppose , nothing unpleasant , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c in going on the barouche box . \u201d \u201c Unpleasant ! \u201d cried Maria : \u201c oh dear ! I believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat . There can be no comparison as to one \u2019s view of the country . Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche - box herself . \u201d \u201c There can be no objection , then , to Fanny \u2019s going with you ; there can be no doubt of your having room for her . \u201d \u201c Fanny ! \u201d repeated Mrs. Norris ; \u201c my dear Edmund , there is no idea of her going with us . She stays with her aunt . I told Mrs. Rushworth so . She is not expected . \u201d \u201c You can have no reason , I imagine , madam , \u201d said he , addressing his mother , \u201c for wishing Fanny _ not _ to be of the party , but as it relates to yourself , to your own comfort . If you could do without her , you would not wish to keep her at home ? \u201d \u201c To be sure not , but I _ can not _ do without her . \u201d \u201c You can , if I stay at home with you , as I mean to do . \u201d There was a general cry out at this . \u201c Yes , \u201d he continued , \u201c there is no necessity for my going , and I mean to stay at home . Fanny has a great desire to see Sotherton . I know she wishes it very much . She has not often a gratification of the kind , and I am sure , ma\u2019am , you would be glad to give her the pleasure now ? \u201d \u201c Oh yes ! very glad , if your aunt sees no objection . \u201d Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could remain \u2014 their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could not go , and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in taking her , which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over . It must have the strangest appearance ! It would be something so very unceremonious , so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth , whose own manners were such a pattern of good - breeding and attention , that she really did not feel equal to it . Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny , and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time ; but her opposition to Edmund _ now _ , arose more from partiality for her own scheme , because it _ was _ her own , than from anything else . She felt that she had arranged everything extremely well , and that any alteration must be for the worse . When Edmund , therefore , told her in reply , as he did when she would give him the hearing , that she need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth \u2019s account , because he had taken the opportunity , as he walked with her through the hall , of mentioning Miss Price as one who would probably be of the party , and had directly received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin , Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with a very good grace , and would only say , \u201c Very well , very well , just as you chuse , settle it your own way , I am sure I do not care about it . \u201d \u201c It seems very odd , \u201d said Maria , \u201c that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . \u201d \u201c I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , \u201d added Julia , hastily leaving the room as she spoke , from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at home herself . \u201c Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires , \u201d was Edmund \u2019s only reply , and the subject dropt . Fanny \u2019s gratitude , when she heard the plan , was , in fact , much greater than her pleasure . She felt Edmund \u2019s kindness with all , and more than all , the sensibility which he , unsuspicious of her fond attachment , could be aware of ; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her account gave her pain , and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton would be nothing without him . The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another alteration in the plan , and one that was admitted with general approbation . Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to Lady Bertram in lieu of her son , and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner . Lady Bertram was very well pleased to have it so , and the young ladies were in spirits again . Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party ; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan , and had it at her tongue \u2019s end , and was on the point of proposing it , when Mrs. Grant spoke . Wednesday was fine , and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived , Mr. Crawford driving his sisters ; and as everybody was ready , there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places . The place of all places , the envied seat , the post of honour , was unappropriated . To whose happy lot was it to fall ? While each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best , and with the most appearance of obliging the others , to secure it , the matter was settled by Mrs. Grant \u2019s saying , as she stepped from the carriage , \u201c As there are five of you , it will be better that one should sit with Henry ; and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive , Julia , I think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson . \u201d Happy Julia ! Unhappy Maria ! The former was on the barouche - box in a moment , the latter took her seat within , in gloom and mortification ; and the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies , and the barking of Pug in his mistress \u2019s arms . Their road was through a pleasant country ; and Fanny , whose rides had never been extensive , was soon beyond her knowledge , and was very happy in observing all that was new , and admiring all that was pretty . She was not often invited to join in the conversation of the others , nor did she desire it . Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best companions ; and , in observing the appearance of the country , the bearings of the roads , the difference of soil , the state of the harvest , the cottages , the cattle , the children , she found entertainment that could only have been heightened by having Edmund to speak to of what she felt . That was the only point of resemblance between her and the lady who sat by her : in everything but a value for Edmund , Miss Crawford was very unlike her . She had none of Fanny \u2019s delicacy of taste , of mind , of feeling ; she saw Nature , inanimate Nature , with little observation ; her attention was all for men and women , her talents for the light and lively . In looking back after Edmund , however , when there was any stretch of road behind them , or when he gained on them in ascending a considerable hill , they were united , and a \u201c there he is \u201d broke at the same moment from them both , more than once . For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort : her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by side , full of conversation and merriment ; and to see only his expressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia , or to catch the laugh of the other , was a perpetual source of irritation , which her own sense of propriety could but just smooth over . When Julia looked back , it was with a countenance of delight , and whenever she spoke to them , it was in the highest spirits : \u201c her view of the country was charming , she wished they could all see it , \u201d etc . ; but her only offer of exchange was addressed to Miss Crawford , as they gained the summit of a long hill , and was not more inviting than this : \u201c Here is a fine burst of country . I wish you had my seat , but I dare say you will not take it , let me press you ever so much ; \u201d and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they were moving again at a good pace . When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations , it was better for Miss Bertram , who might be said to have two strings to her bow . She had Rushworth feelings , and Crawford feelings , and in the vicinity of Sotherton the former had considerable effect . Mr. Rushworth \u2019s consequence was hers . She could not tell Miss Crawford that \u201c those woods belonged to Sotherton , \u201d she could not carelessly observe that \u201c she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth \u2019s property on each side of the road , \u201d without elation of heart ; and it was a pleasure to increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion , and ancient manorial residence of the family , with all its rights of court - leet and court - baron . \u201c Now we shall have no more rough road , Miss Crawford ; our difficulties are over . The rest of the way is such as it ought to be . Mr. Rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate . Here begins the village . Those cottages are really a disgrace . The church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome . I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places . The annoyance of the bells must be terrible . There is the parsonage : a tidy - looking house , and I understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people . Those are almshouses , built by some of the family . To the right is the steward \u2019s house ; he is a very respectable man . Now we are coming to the lodge - gates ; but we have nearly a mile through the park still . It is not ugly , you see , at this end ; there is some fine timber , but the situation of the house is dreadful . We go down hill to it for half a mile , and it is a pity , for it would not be an ill - looking place if it had a better approach . \u201d Miss Crawford was not slow to admire ; she pretty well guessed Miss Bertram \u2019s feelings , and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment to the utmost . Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility ; and even Fanny had something to say in admiration , and might be heard with complacency . Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach ; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house , and observing that \u201c it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , \u201d she added , \u201c Now , where is the avenue ? The house fronts the east , I perceive . The avenue , therefore , must be at the back of it . Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front . \u201d \u201c Yes , it is exactly behind the house ; begins at a little distance , and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds . You may see something of it here \u2014 something of the more distant trees . It is oak entirely . \u201d Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion ; and her spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish , when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal entrance .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [0, 2], "text": "VIII Fanny"},
