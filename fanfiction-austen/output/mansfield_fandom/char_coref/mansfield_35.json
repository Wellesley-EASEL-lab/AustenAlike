{"document": "XXXV Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or not ; and that if she did not lead the way , it should never be touched on by him ; but after a day or two of mutual reserve , he was induced by his father to change his mind , and try what his influence might do for his friend . A day , and a very early day , was actually fixed for the Crawfords \u2019 departure ; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more effort for the young man before he left Mansfield , that all his professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to sustain them as possible . Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr. Crawford \u2019s character in that point . He wished him to be a model of constancy ; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not trying him too long . Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business ; he wanted to know Fanny \u2019s feelings . She had been used to consult him in every difficulty , and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now ; he hoped to be of service to her , he thought he must be of service to her ; whom else had she to open her heart to ? If she did not need counsel , she must need the comfort of communication . Fanny estranged from him , silent and reserved , was an unnatural state of things ; a state which he must break through , and which he could easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through . \u201c I will speak to her , sir : I will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , \u201d was the result of such thoughts as these ; and upon Sir Thomas \u2019s information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery , he instantly joined her . \u201c I am come to walk with you , Fanny , \u201d said he . \u201c Shall I ? \u201d Drawing her arm within his . \u201c It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together . \u201d She assented to it all rather by look than word . Her spirits were low . \u201c But , Fanny , \u201d he presently added , \u201c in order to have a comfortable walk , something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together . You must talk to me . I know you have something on your mind . I know what you are thinking of . You can not suppose me uninformed . Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself ? \u201d Fanny , at once agitated and dejected , replied , \u201c If you hear of it from everybody , cousin , there can be nothing for me to tell . \u201d \u201c Not of facts , perhaps ; but of feelings , Fanny . No one but you can tell me them . I do not mean to press you , however . If it is not what you wish yourself , I have done . I had thought it might be a relief . \u201d \u201c I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what I feel . \u201d \u201c Do you suppose that we think differently ? I have no idea of it . I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point \u2014 I consider Crawford \u2019s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection . I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him . Can there be any disagreement between us here ? \u201d \u201c Oh no ! But I thought you blamed me . I thought you were against me . This is such a comfort ! \u201d \u201c This comfort you might have had sooner , Fanny , had you sought it . But how could you possibly suppose me against you ? How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ? Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? \u201d \u201c My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . \u201d \u201c As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right . I may be sorry , I may be surprised \u2014 though hardly _ that _ , for you had not had time to attach yourself \u2014 but I think you perfectly right . Can it admit of a question ? It is disgraceful to us if it does . You did not love him ; nothing could have justified your accepting him . \u201d Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days . \u201c So far your conduct has been faultless , and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise . But the matter does not end here . Crawford \u2019s is no common attachment ; he perseveres , with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before . This , we know , must be a work of time . But \u201d ( with an affectionate smile ) \u201c let him succeed at last , Fanny , let him succeed at last . You have proved yourself upright and disinterested , prove yourself grateful and tender - hearted ; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for . \u201d \u201c Oh ! never , never , never ! he never will succeed with me . \u201d And she spoke with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund , and which she blushed at the recollection of herself , when she saw his look , and heard him reply , \u201c Never ! Fanny!\u2014so very determined and positive ! This is not like yourself , your rational self . \u201d \u201c I mean , \u201d she cried , sorrowfully correcting herself , \u201c that I _ think _ I never shall , as far as the future can be answered for ; I think I never shall return his regard . \u201d \u201c I must hope better things . I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years \u2019 growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation . I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him . I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for . I wish he had known you as well as I do , Fanny . Between us , I think we should have won you . My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed . He should have worked upon my plans . I must hope , however , that time , proving him ( as I firmly believe it will ) to deserve you by his steady affection , will give him his reward . I can not suppose that you have not the _ wish _ to love him \u2014 the natural wish of gratitude . You must have some feeling of that sort . You must be sorry for your own indifference . \u201d \u201c We are so totally unlike , \u201d said Fanny , avoiding a direct answer , \u201c we are so very , very different in all our inclinations and ways , that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together , even if I _ could _ like him . There never were two people more dissimilar . We have not one taste in common . We should be miserable . \u201d \u201c You are mistaken , Fanny . The dissimilarity is not so strong . You are quite enough alike . You _ have _ tastes in common . You have moral and literary tastes in common . You have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings ; and , Fanny , who that heard him read , and saw you listen to Shakespeare the other night , will think you unfitted as companions ? You forget yourself : there is a decided difference in your tempers , I allow . He is lively , you are serious ; but so much the better : his spirits will support yours . It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are . His cheerfulness will counteract this . He sees difficulties nowhere : and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you . Your being so far unlike , Fanny , does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together : do not imagine it . I am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance . I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike : I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits , in the manners , in the inclination for much or little company , in the propensity to talk or to be silent , to be grave or to be gay . Some opposition here is , I am thoroughly convinced , friendly to matrimonial happiness . I exclude extremes , of course ; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme . A counteraction , gentle and continual , is the best safeguard of manners and conduct . \u201d Full well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now : Miss Crawford \u2019s power was all returning . He had been speaking of her cheerfully from the hour of his coming home . His avoiding her was quite at an end . He had dined at the Parsonage only the preceding day . After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes , Fanny , feeling it due to herself , returned to Mr. Crawford , and said , \u201c It is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _ that _ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more . I must say , cousin , that I can not approve his character . I have not thought well of him from the time of the play . I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly \u2014 I may speak of it now because it is all over \u2014 so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which \u2014 in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over . \u201d \u201c My dear Fanny , \u201d replied Edmund , scarcely hearing her to the end , \u201c let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly . The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect . Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself . Compared with me , all the rest were blameless . I was playing the fool with my eyes open . \u201d \u201c As a bystander , \u201d said Fanny , \u201c perhaps I saw more than you did ; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous . \u201d \u201c Very possibly . No wonder . Nothing could be more improper than the whole business . I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest . \u201d \u201c Before the play , I am much mistaken if _ Julia _ did not think he was paying her attentions . \u201d \u201c Julia ! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia ; but I could never see anything of it . And , Fanny , though I hope I do justice to my sisters \u2019 good qualities , I think it very possible that they might , one or both , be more desirous of being admired by Crawford , and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent . I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society ; and with such encouragement , a man like Crawford , lively , and it may be , a little unthinking , might be led on to \u2014 there could be nothing very striking , because it is clear that he had no pretensions : his heart was reserved for you . And I must say , that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion . It does him the highest honour ; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment . It proves him unspoilt by his uncle . It proves him , in short , everything that I had been used to wish to believe him , and feared he was not . \u201d \u201c I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . \u201d \u201c Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case . How could it be otherwise , with such an education and adviser ? Under the disadvantages , indeed , which both have had , is it not wonderful that they should be what they are ? Crawford \u2019s _ feelings _ , I am ready to acknowledge , have hitherto been too much his guides . Happily , those feelings have generally been good . You will supply the rest ; and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature \u2014 to a woman who , firm as a rock in her own principles , has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them . He has chosen his partner , indeed , with rare felicity . He will make you happy , Fanny ; I know he will make you happy ; but you will make him everything . \u201d \u201c I would not engage in such a charge , \u201d cried Fanny , in a shrinking accent ; \u201c in such an office of high responsibility ! \u201d \u201c As usual , believing yourself unequal to anything ! fancying everything too much for you ! Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust . I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may . I have no common interest in Crawford \u2019s well - doing . Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me . You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford . \u201d Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say ; and they walked on together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction . Edmund first began again \u2014 \u201c I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light . I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune . I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear . But it was very different . She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought . She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself . We had a long talk about it . I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself . Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . \u201d \u201c Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? \u201d \u201c Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in . \u201d \u201c It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . \u201d \u201c Yes , she laments it ; yet owns it may have been best . You will see her , however , before she goes . She is very angry with you , Fanny ; you must be prepared for that . She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger . It is the regret and disappointment of a sister , who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for , at the first moment . She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart . \u201d \u201c I knew she would be very angry with me . \u201d \u201c My dearest Fanny , \u201d cried Edmund , pressing her arm closer to him , \u201c do not let the idea of her anger distress you . It is anger to be talked of rather than felt . Her heart is made for love and kindness , not for resentment . I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise ; I wish you could have seen her countenance , when she said that you _ should _ be Henry \u2019s wife . And I observed that she always spoke of you as \u2018 Fanny , \u2019 which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality . \u201d \u201c And Mrs. Grant , did she say \u2014 did she speak ; was she there all the time ? \u201d \u201c Yes , she was agreeing exactly with her sister . The surprise of your refusal , Fanny , seems to have been unbounded . That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand . I said what I could for you ; but in good truth , as they stated the case \u2014 you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct ; nothing else will satisfy them . But this is teasing you . I have done . Do not turn away from me . \u201d \u201c I _ should _ have thought , \u201d said Fanny , after a pause of recollection and exertion , \u201c that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man \u2019s not being approved , not being loved by some one of her sex at least , let him be ever so generally agreeable . Let him have all the perfections in the world , I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself . But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ? He took me wholly by surprise . I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . In my situation , it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford . I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . How , then , was I to be \u2014 to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ? How was I to have an attachment at his service , as soon as it was asked for ? His sisters should consider me as well as him . The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him . And , and \u2014 we think very differently of the nature of women , if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply . \u201d \u201c My dear , dear Fanny , now I have the truth . I know this to be the truth ; and most worthy of you are such feelings . I had attributed them to you before . I thought I could understand you . You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry . I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford \u2019s addresses was against him . Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character . Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother . She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time , and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years \u2019 happy marriage . \u201d Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for . Her feelings were all in revolt . She feared she had been doing wrong : saying too much , overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary ; in guarding against one evil , laying herself open to another ; and to have Miss Crawford \u2019s liveliness repeated to her at such a moment , and on such a subject , was a bitter aggravation . Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face , and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion ; and not even to mention the name of Crawford again , except as it might be connected with what _ must _ be agreeable to her . On this principle , he soon afterwards observed\u2014\u201cThey go on Monday . You are sure , therefore , of seeing your friend either to - morrow or Sunday . They really go on Monday ; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day ! I had almost promised it . What a difference it might have made ! Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life . \u201d \u201c You were near staying there ? \u201d \u201c Very . I was most kindly pressed , and had nearly consented . Had I received any letter from Mansfield , to tell me how you were all going on , I believe I should certainly have staid ; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight , and felt that I had been away long enough . \u201d \u201c You spent your time pleasantly there ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; that is , it was the fault of my own mind if I did not . They were all very pleasant . I doubt their finding me so . I took uneasiness with me , and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again . \u201d \u201c The Miss Owens \u2014 you liked them , did not you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very well . Pleasant , good - humoured , unaffected girls . But I am spoilt , Fanny , for common female society . Good - humoured , unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women . They are two distinct orders of being . You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . \u201d Still , however , Fanny was oppressed and wearied ; he saw it in her looks , it could not be talked away ; and attempting it no more , he led her directly , with the kind authority of a privileged guardian , into the house .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 10], "text": "Fanny"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "her"}, {"position":
