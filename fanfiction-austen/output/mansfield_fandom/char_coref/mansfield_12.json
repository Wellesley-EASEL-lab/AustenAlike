{"document": "XII Sir Thomas was to return in November , and his eldest son had duties to call him earlier home . The approach of September brought tidings of Mr. Bertram , first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter to Edmund ; and by the end of August he arrived himself , to be gay , agreeable , and gallant again as occasion served , or Miss Crawford demanded ; to tell of races and Weymouth , and parties and friends , to which she might have listened six weeks before with some interest , and altogether to give her the fullest conviction , by the power of actual comparison , of her preferring his younger brother . It was very vexatious , and she was heartily sorry for it ; but so it was ; and so far from now meaning to marry the elder , she did not even want to attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty required : his lengthened absence from Mansfield , without anything but pleasure in view , and his own will to consult , made it perfectly clear that he did not care about her ; and his indifference was so much more than equalled by her own , that were he now to step forth the owner of Mansfield Park , the Sir Thomas complete , which he was to be in time , she did not believe she could accept him . The season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield took Mr. Crawford into Norfolk . Everingham could not do without him in the beginning of September . He went for a fortnight \u2014 a fortnight of such dullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their guard , and made even Julia admit , in her jealousy of her sister , the absolute necessity of distrusting his attentions , and wishing him not to return ; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure , in the intervals of shooting and sleeping , to have convinced the gentleman that he ought to keep longer away , had he been more in the habit of examining his own motives , and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was tending ; but , thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example , he would not look beyond the present moment . The sisters , handsome , clever , and encouraging , were an amusement to his sated mind ; and finding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield , he gladly returned to it at the time appointed , and was welcomed thither quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with further . Maria , with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her , and doomed to the repeated details of his day \u2019s sport , good or bad , his boast of his dogs , his jealousy of his neighbours , his doubts of their qualifications , and his zeal after poachers , subjects which will not find their way to female feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on the other , had missed Mr. Crawford grievously ; and Julia , unengaged and unemployed , felt all the right of missing him much more . Each sister believed herself the favourite . Julia might be justified in so doing by the hints of Mrs. Grant , inclined to credit what she wished , and Maria by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself . Everything returned into the same channel as before his absence ; his manners being to each so animated and agreeable as to lose no ground with either , and just stopping short of the consistence , the steadiness , the solicitude , and the warmth which might excite general notice . Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike ; but since the day at Sotherton , she could never see Mr. Crawford with either sister without observation , and seldom without wonder or censure ; and had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it in every other respect , had she been sure that she was seeing clearly , and judging candidly , she would probably have made some important communications to her usual confidant . As it was , however , she only hazarded a hint , and the hint was lost . \u201c I am rather surprised , \u201d said she , \u201c that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon , after being here so long before , full seven weeks ; for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about , that I thought something would certainly occur , when he was once gone , to take him elsewhere . He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield . \u201d \u201c It is to his credit , \u201d was Edmund \u2019s answer ; \u201c and I dare say it gives his sister pleasure . She does not like his unsettled habits . \u201d \u201c What a favourite he is with my cousins ! \u201d \u201c Yes , his manners to women are such as must please . Mrs. Grant , I believe , suspects him of a preference for Julia ; I have never seen much symptom of it , but I wish it may be so . He has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove . \u201d \u201c If Miss Bertram were not engaged , \u201d said Fanny cautiously , \u201c I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia . \u201d \u201c Which is , perhaps , more in favour of his liking Julia best , than you , Fanny , may be aware ; for I believe it often happens that a man , before he has quite made up his own mind , will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself . Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria ; and I am not at all afraid for her , after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong . \u201d Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken , and meant to think differently in future ; but with all that submission to Edmund could do , and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some of the others , and which seemed to say that Julia was Mr. Crawford \u2019s choice , she knew not always what to think . She was privy , one evening , to the hopes of her aunt Norris on the subject , as well as to her feelings , and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth , on a point of some similarity , and could not help wondering as she listened ; and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen , for it was while all the other young people were dancing , and she sitting , most unwillingly , among the chaperons at the fire , longing for the re - entrance of her elder cousin , on whom all her own hopes of a partner then depended . It was Fanny \u2019s first ball , though without the preparation or splendour of many a young lady \u2019s first ball , being the thought only of the afternoon , built on the late acquisition of a violin player in the servants \u2019 hall , and the possibility of raising five couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr. Bertram \u2019s just arrived on a visit . It had , however , been a very happy one to Fanny through four dances , and she was quite grieved to be losing even a quarter of an hour . While waiting and wishing , looking now at the dancers and now at the door , this dialogue between the two above - mentioned ladies was forced on her \u2014 \u201c I think , ma\u2019am , \u201d said Mrs. Norris , her eyes directed towards Mr. Rushworth and Maria , who were partners for the second time , \u201c we shall see some happy faces again now . \u201d \u201c Yes , ma\u2019am , indeed , \u201d replied the other , with a stately simper , \u201c there will be some satisfaction in looking on _ now _ , and I think it was rather a pity they should have been obliged to part . Young folks in their situation should be excused complying with the common forms . I wonder my son did not propose it . \u201d \u201c I dare say he did , ma\u2019am . Mr. Rushworth is never remiss . But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety , so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays , Mrs. Rushworth \u2014 that wish of avoiding particularity ! Dear ma\u2019am , only look at her face at this moment ; how different from what it was the two last dances ! \u201d Miss Bertram did indeed look happy , her eyes were sparkling with pleasure , and she was speaking with great animation , for Julia and her partner , Mr. Crawford , were close to her ; they were all in a cluster together . How she had looked before , Fanny could not recollect , for she had been dancing with Edmund herself , and had not thought about her . Mrs. Norris continued , \u201c It is quite delightful , ma\u2019am , to see young people so properly happy , so well suited , and so much the thing ! I can not but think of dear Sir Thomas \u2019s delight . And what do you say , ma\u2019am , to the chance of another match ? Mr. Rushworth has set a good example , and such things are very catching . \u201d Mrs. Rushworth , who saw nothing but her son , was quite at a loss . \u201c The couple above , ma\u2019am . Do you see no symptoms there ? \u201d \u201c Oh dear ! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford . Yes , indeed , a very pretty match . What is his property ? \u201d \u201c Four thousand a year . \u201d \u201c Very well . Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have . Four thousand a year is a pretty estate , and he seems a very genteel , steady young man , so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy . \u201d \u201c It is not a settled thing , ma\u2019am , yet . We only speak of it among friends . But I have very little doubt it _ will _ be . He is growing extremely particular in his attentions . \u201d Fanny could listen no farther . Listening and wondering were all suspended for a time , for Mr. Bertram was in the room again ; and though feeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him , she thought it must happen . He came towards their little circle ; but instead of asking her to dance , drew a chair near her , and gave her an account of the present state of a sick horse , and the opinion of the groom , from whom he had just parted . Fanny found that it was not to be , and in the modesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable in expecting it . When he had told of his horse , he took a newspaper from the table , and looking over it , said in a languid way , \u201c If you want to dance , Fanny , I will stand up with you . \u201d With more than equal civility the offer was declined ; she did not wish to dance . \u201c I am glad of it , \u201d said he , in a much brisker tone , and throwing down the newspaper again , \u201c for I am tired to death . I only wonder how the good people can keep it up so long . They had need be _ all _ in love , to find any amusement in such folly ; and so they are , I fancy . If you look at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers \u2014 all but Yates and Mrs. Grant \u2014 and , between ourselves , she , poor woman , must want a lover as much as any one of them . A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor , \u201d making a sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the latter , who proving , however , to be close at his elbow , made so instantaneous a change of expression and subject necessary , as Fanny , in spite of everything , could hardly help laughing at . \u201c A strange business this in America , Dr. Grant ! What is your opinion ? I always come to you to know what I am to think of public matters . \u201d \u201c My dear Tom , \u201d cried his aunt soon afterwards , \u201c as you are not dancing , I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber ; shall you ? \u201d Then leaving her seat , and coming to him to enforce the proposal , added in a whisper , \u201c We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth , you know . Your mother is quite anxious about it , but can not very well spare time to sit down herself , because of her fringe . Now , you and I and Dr. Grant will just do ; and though _ we _ play but half - crowns , you know , you may bet half - guineas with _ him _ . \u201d \u201c I should be most happy , \u201d replied he aloud , and jumping up with alacrity , \u201c it would give me the greatest pleasure ; but that I am this moment going to dance . Come , Fanny , \u201d taking her hand , \u201c do not be dawdling any longer , or the dance will be over . \u201d Fanny was led off very willingly , though it was impossible for her to feel much gratitude towards her cousin , or distinguish , as he certainly did , between the selfishness of another person and his own . \u201c A pretty modest request upon my word , \u201d he indignantly exclaimed as they walked away . \u201c To want to nail me to a card - table for the next two hours with herself and Dr. Grant , who are always quarrelling , and that poking old woman , who knows no more of whist than of algebra . I wish my good aunt would be a little less busy ! And to ask me in such a way too ! without ceremony , before them all , so as to leave me no possibility of refusing . _ That _ is what I dislike most particularly . It raises my spleen more than anything , to have the pretence of being asked , of being given a choice , and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing , whatever it be ! If I had not luckily thought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it . It is a great deal too bad . But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head , nothing can stop her . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Sir Thomas"}, {"position": [10, 11], "text": "his"},
