{"document": "XXX Miss Crawford \u2019s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation , and she walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another week of the same small party in the same bad weather , had they been put to the proof ; but as that very evening brought her brother down from London again in quite , or more than quite , his usual cheerfulness , she had nothing farther to try her own . His still refusing to tell her what he had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety ; a day before it might have irritated , but now it was a pleasant joke \u2014 suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself . And the next day _ did _ bring a surprise to her . Henry had said he should just go and ask the Bertrams how they did , and be back in ten minutes , but he was gone above an hour ; and when his sister , who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden , met him at last most impatiently in the sweep , and cried out , \u201c My dear Henry , where can you have been all this time ? \u201d he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady Bertram and Fanny . \u201c Sitting with them an hour and a half ! \u201d exclaimed Mary . But this was only the beginning of her surprise . \u201c Yes , Mary , \u201d said he , drawing her arm within his , and walking along the sweep as if not knowing where he was : \u201c I could not get away sooner ; Fanny looked so lovely ! I am quite determined , Mary . My mind is entirely made up . Will it astonish you ? No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . \u201d The surprise was now complete ; for , in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest , a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister \u2019s imagination ; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt , that he was obliged to repeat what he had said , and more fully and more solemnly . The conviction of his determination once admitted , it was not unwelcome . There was even pleasure with the surprise . Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family , and to be not displeased with her brother \u2019s marrying a little beneath him . \u201c Yes , Mary , \u201d was Henry \u2019s concluding assurance . \u201c I am fairly caught . You know with what idle designs I began ; but this is the end of them . I have , I flatter myself , made no inconsiderable progress in her affections ; but my own are entirely fixed . \u201d \u201c Lucky , lucky girl ! \u201d cried Mary , as soon as she could speak ; \u201c what a match for her ! My dearest Henry , this must be my _ first _ feeling ; but my _ second _ , which you shall have as sincerely , is , that I approve your choice from my soul , and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it . You will have a sweet little wife ; all gratitude and devotion . Exactly what you deserve . What an amazing match for her ! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck ; what will she say now ? The delight of all the family , indeed ! And she has some _ true _ friends in it ! How _ they _ will rejoice ! But tell me all about it ! Talk to me for ever . When did you begin to think seriously about her ? \u201d Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question , though nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked . \u201c How the pleasing plague had stolen on him \u201d he could not say ; and before he had expressed the same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over , his sister eagerly interrupted him with , \u201c Ah , my dear Henry , and this is what took you to London ! This was your business ! You chose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind . \u201d But this he stoutly denied . He knew his uncle too well to consult him on any matrimonial scheme . The Admiral hated marriage , and thought it never pardonable in a young man of independent fortune . \u201c When Fanny is known to him , \u201d continued Henry , \u201c he will doat on her . She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral , for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world . She is the very impossibility he would describe , if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas . But till it is absolutely settled \u2014 settled beyond all interference , he shall know nothing of the matter . No , Mary , you are quite mistaken . You have not discovered my business yet . \u201d \u201c Well , well , I am satisfied . I know now to whom it must relate , and am in no hurry for the rest . Fanny Price ! wonderful , quite wonderful ! That Mansfield should have done so much for \u2014 that _ you _ should have found your fate in Mansfield ! But you are quite right ; you could not have chosen better . There is not a better girl in the world , and you do not want for fortune ; and as to her connexions , they are more than good . The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country . She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram ; that will be enough for the world . But go on , go on . Tell me more . What are your plans ? Does she know her own happiness ? \u201d \u201c No . \u201d \u201c What are you waiting for ? \u201d \u201c For \u2014 for very little more than opportunity . Mary , she is not like her cousins ; but I think I shall not ask in vain . \u201d \u201c Oh no ! you can not . Were you even less pleasing \u2014 supposing her not to love you already ( of which , however , I can have little doubt)\u2014you would be safe . The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately . From my soul I do not think she would marry you _ without _ love ; that is , if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition , I can suppose it her ; but ask her to love you , and she will never have the heart to refuse . \u201d As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence , he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen ; and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself , though he had in fact nothing to relate but his own sensations , nothing to dwell on but Fanny \u2019s charms . Fanny \u2019s beauty of face and figure , Fanny \u2019s graces of manner and goodness of heart , were the exhaustless theme . The gentleness , modesty , and sweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on ; that sweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman \u2019s worth in the judgment of man , that though he sometimes loves where it is not , he can never believe it absent . Her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise . He had often seen it tried . Was there one of the family , excepting Edmund , who had not in some way or other continually exercised her patience and forbearance ? Her affections were evidently strong . To see her with her brother ! What could more delightfully prove that the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness ? What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love in view ? Then , her understanding was beyond every suspicion , quick and clear ; and her manners were the mirror of her own modest and elegant mind . Nor was this all . Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles in a wife , though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection to know them by their proper name ; but when he talked of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct , such a high notion of honour , and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity , he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well principled and religious . \u201c I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her , \u201d said he ; \u201c and _ that _ is what I want . \u201d Well might his sister , believing as she really did that his opinion of Fanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits , rejoice in her prospects . \u201c The more I think of it , \u201d she cried , \u201c the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy . Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed . You will both find your good in it . \u201d \u201c It was bad , very bad in me against such a creature ; but I did not know her then ; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head . I will make her very happy , Mary ; happier than she has ever yet been herself , or ever seen anybody else . I will not take her from Northamptonshire . I shall let Everingham , and rent a place in this neighbourhood ; perhaps Stanwix Lodge . I shall let a seven years \u2019 lease of Everingham . I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word . I could name three people now , who would give me my own terms and thank me . \u201d \u201c Ha ! \u201d cried Mary ; \u201c settle in Northamptonshire ! That is pleasant ! Then we shall be all together . \u201d When she had spoken it , she recollected herself , and wished it unsaid ; but there was no need of confusion ; for her brother saw her only as the supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage , and replied but to invite her in the kindest manner to his own house , and to claim the best right in her . \u201c You must give us more than half your time , \u201d said he . \u201c I can not admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself , for we shall both have a right in you . Fanny will be so truly your sister ! \u201d Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances ; but she was now very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sister many months longer . \u201c You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire ? \u201d \u201c Yes . \u201d \u201c That \u2019s right ; and in London , of course , a house of your own : no longer with the Admiral . My dearest Henry , the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his , before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions , or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life ! _ You _ are not sensible of the gain , for your regard for him has blinded you ; but , in my estimation , your marrying early may be the saving of you . To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed , look or gesture , would have broken my heart . \u201d \u201c Well , well , we do not think quite alike here . The Admiral has his faults , but he is a very good man , and has been more than a father to me . Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much . You must not prejudice Fanny against him . I must have them love one another . \u201d Mary refrained from saying what she felt , that there could not be two persons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant : time would discover it to him ; but she could not help _ this _ reflection on the Admiral . \u201c Henry , I think so highly of Fanny Price , that if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill - used aunt had to abhor the very name , I would prevent the marriage , if possible ; but I know you : I know that a wife you _ loved _ would be the happiest of women , and that even when you ceased to love , she would yet find in you the liberality and good - breeding of a gentleman . \u201d The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny Price happy , or of ceasing to love Fanny Price , was of course the groundwork of his eloquent answer . \u201c Had you seen her this morning , Mary , \u201d he continued , \u201c attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt \u2019s stupidity , working with her , and for her , her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work , then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman \u2019s service , and all this with such unpretending gentleness , so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command , her hair arranged as neatly as it always is , and one little curl falling forward as she wrote , which she now and then shook back , and in the midst of all this , still speaking at intervals to _ me _ , or listening , and as if she liked to listen , to what I said . Had you seen her so , Mary , you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing . \u201d \u201c My dearest Henry , \u201d cried Mary , stopping short , and smiling in his face , \u201c how glad I am to see you so much in love ! It quite delights me . But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say ? \u201d \u201c I care neither what they say nor what they feel . They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me , that can attach a man of sense . I wish the discovery may do them any good . And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be , and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness . They will be angry , \u201d he added , after a moment \u2019s silence , and in a cooler tone ; \u201c Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry . It will be a bitter pill to her ; that is , like other bitter pills , it will have two moments \u2019 ill flavour , and then be swallowed and forgotten ; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women \u2019s , though _ I _ was the object of them . Yes , Mary , my Fanny will feel a difference indeed : a daily , hourly difference , in the behaviour of every being who approaches her ; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it , that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due . Now she is dependent , helpless , friendless , neglected , forgotten . \u201d \u201c Nay , Henry , not by all ; not forgotten by all ; not friendless or forgotten . Her cousin Edmund never forgets her . \u201d \u201c Edmund ! True , I believe he is , generally speaking , kind to her , and so is Sir Thomas in his way ; but it is the way of a rich , superior , long - worded , arbitrary uncle . What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do , what _ do _ they do for her happiness , comfort , honour , and dignity in the world , to what I _ shall _ do ? \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions":
