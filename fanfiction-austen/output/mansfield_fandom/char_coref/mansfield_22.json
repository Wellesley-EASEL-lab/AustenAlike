{"document": "XXII Fanny \u2019s consequence increased on the departure of her cousins . Becoming , as she then did , the only young woman in the drawing - room , the only occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she had hitherto held so humble a third , it was impossible for her not to be more looked at , more thought of and attended to , than she had ever been before ; and \u201c Where is Fanny ? \u201d became no uncommon question , even without her being wanted for any one \u2019s convenience . Not only at home did her value increase , but at the Parsonage too . In that house , which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr. Norris \u2019s death , she became a welcome , an invited guest , and in the gloom and dirt of a November day , most acceptable to Mary Crawford . Her visits there , beginning by chance , were continued by solicitation . Mrs. Grant , really eager to get any change for her sister , could , by the easiest self - deceit , persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing by Fanny , and giving her the most important opportunities of improvement in pressing her frequent calls . Fanny , having been sent into the village on some errand by her aunt Norris , was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage ; and being descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter under the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their premises , was forced , though not without some modest reluctance on her part , to come in . A civil servant she had withstood ; but when Dr. Grant himself went out with an umbrella , there was nothing to be done but to be very much ashamed , and to get into the house as fast as possible ; and to poor Miss Crawford , who had just been contemplating the dismal rain in a very desponding state of mind , sighing over the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning , and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty - four hours , the sound of a little bustle at the front door , and the sight of Miss Price dripping with wet in the vestibule , was delightful . The value of an event on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her . She was all alive again directly , and among the most active in being useful to Fanny , in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first allow , and providing her with dry clothes ; and Fanny , after being obliged to submit to all this attention , and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses and maids , being also obliged , on returning downstairs , to be fixed in their drawing - room for an hour while the rain continued , the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford , and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing and dinner . The two sisters were so kind to her , and so pleasant , that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way , and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the end of the hour , and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant \u2019s carriage and horses out to take her home , with which she was threatened . As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home , she had nothing to suffer on that score ; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts , she was perfectly aware that none would be felt , and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain , her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram . It was beginning to look brighter , when Fanny , observing a harp in the room , asked some questions about it , which soon led to an acknowledgment of her wishing very much to hear it , and a confession , which could hardly be believed , of her having never yet heard it since its being in Mansfield . To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and natural circumstance . She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since the instrument \u2019s arrival , there had been no reason that she should ; but Miss Crawford , calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject , was concerned at her own neglect ; and \u201c Shall I play to you now ? \u201d and \u201c What will you have ? \u201d were questions immediately following with the readiest good - humour . She played accordingly ; happy to have a new listener , and a listener who seemed so much obliged , so full of wonder at the performance , and who shewed herself not wanting in taste . She played till Fanny \u2019s eyes , straying to the window on the weather \u2019s being evidently fair , spoke what she felt must be done . \u201c Another quarter of an hour , \u201d said Miss Crawford , \u201c and we shall see how it will be . Do not run away the first moment of its holding up . Those clouds look alarming . \u201d \u201c But they are passed over , \u201d said Fanny . \u201c I have been watching them . This weather is all from the south . \u201d \u201c South or north , I know a black cloud when I see it ; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening . And besides , I want to play something more to you \u2014 a very pretty piece \u2014 and your cousin Edmund \u2019s prime favourite . You must stay and hear your cousin \u2019s favourite . \u201d Fanny felt that she must ; and though she had not waited for that sentence to be thinking of Edmund , such a memento made her particularly awake to his idea , and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again , perhaps in the very spot where she sat now , listening with constant delight to the favourite air , played , as it appeared to her , with superior tone and expression ; and though pleased with it herself , and glad to like whatever was liked by him , she was more sincerely impatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before ; and on this being evident , she was so kindly asked to call again , to take them in her walk whenever she could , to come and hear more of the harp , that she felt it necessary to be done , if no objection arose at home . Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between them within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams \u2019 going away \u2014 an intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford \u2019s desire of something new , and which had little reality in Fanny \u2019s feelings . Fanny went to her every two or three days : it seemed a kind of fascination : she could not be easy without going , and yet it was without loving her , without ever thinking like her , without any sense of obligation for being sought after now when nobody else was to be had ; and deriving no higher pleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement , and _ that _ often at the expense of her judgment , when it was raised by pleasantry on people or subjects which she wished to be respected . She went , however , and they sauntered about together many an half - hour in Mrs. Grant \u2019s shrubbery , the weather being unusually mild for the time of year , and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now comparatively unsheltered , remaining there perhaps till , in the midst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny \u2019s on the sweets of so protracted an autumn , they were forced , by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them , to jump up and walk for warmth . \u201c This is pretty , very pretty , \u201d said Fanny , looking around her as they were thus sitting together one day ; \u201c every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty . Three years ago , this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field , never thought of as anything , or capable of becoming anything ; and now it is converted into a walk , and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament ; and perhaps , in another three years , we may be forgetting \u2014 almost forgetting what it was before . How wonderful , how very wonderful the operations of time , and the changes of the human mind ! \u201d And following the latter train of thought , she soon afterwards added : \u201c If any one faculty of our nature may be called _ more _ wonderful than the rest , I do think it is memory . There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers , the failures , the inequalities of memory , than in any other of our intelligences . The memory is sometimes so retentive , so serviceable , so obedient ; at others , so bewildered and so weak ; and at others again , so tyrannic , so beyond control ! We are , to be sure , a miracle every way ; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out . \u201d Miss Crawford , untouched and inattentive , had nothing to say ; and Fanny , perceiving it , brought back her own mind to what she thought must interest . \u201c It may seem impertinent in _ me _ to praise , but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this . There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk ! Not too much attempted ! \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d replied Miss Crawford carelessly , \u201c it does very well for a place of this sort . One does not think of extent _ here _ ; and between ourselves , till I came to Mansfield , I had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery , or anything of the kind . \u201d \u201c I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive ! \u201d said Fanny , in reply . \u201c My uncle \u2019s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own , and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general . The evergreen ! How beautiful , how welcome , how wonderful the evergreen ! When one thinks of it , how astonishing a variety of nature ! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety , but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence . You will think me rhapsodising ; but when I am out of doors , especially when I am sitting out of doors , I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain . One can not fix one \u2019s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy . \u201d \u201c To say the truth , \u201d replied Miss Crawford , \u201c I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV . ; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it . If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home , that I should be spending month after month here , as I have done , I certainly should not have believed them . I have now been here nearly five months ; and , moreover , the quietest five months I ever passed . \u201d \u201c _ Too _ quiet for you , I believe . \u201d \u201c I should have thought so _ theoretically _ myself , but , \u201d and her eyes brightened as she spoke , \u201c take it all and all , I never spent so happy a summer . But then , \u201d with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice , \u201c there is no saying what it may lead to . \u201d Fanny \u2019s heart beat quick , and she felt quite unequal to surmising or soliciting anything more . Miss Crawford , however , with renewed animation , soon went on \u2014 \u201c I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be . I can even suppose it pleasant to spend _ half _ the year in the country , under certain circumstances , very pleasant . An elegant , moderate - sized house in the centre of family connexions ; continual engagements among them ; commanding the first society in the neighbourhood ; looked up to , perhaps , as leading it even more than those of larger fortune , and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ with the person one feels most agreeable in the world . There is nothing frightful in such a picture , is there , Miss Price ? One need not envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _ that _ . \u201d \u201c Envy Mrs. Rushworth ! \u201d was all that Fanny attempted to say . \u201c Come , come , it would be very un - handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth , for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay , brilliant , happy hours . I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year . Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing ; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s wife must be to fill her house , and give the best balls in the country . \u201d Fanny was silent , and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness , till suddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes , she exclaimed , \u201c Ah ! here he is . \u201d It was not Mr. Rushworth , however , but Edmund , who then appeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant . \u201c My sister and Mr. Bertram . I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone , that he may be Mr. Bertram again . There is something in the sound of Mr. _ Edmund _ Bertram so formal , so pitiful , so younger - brother - like , that I detest it . \u201d \u201c How differently we feel ! \u201d cried Fanny . \u201c To me , the sound of _ Mr. _ Bertram is so cold and nothing - meaning , so entirely without warmth or character ! It just stands for a gentleman , and that \u2019s all . But there is nobleness in the name of Edmund . It is a name of heroism and renown ; of kings , princes , and knights ; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections . \u201d \u201c I grant you the name is good in itself , and _ Lord _ Edmund or _ Sir _ Edmund sound delightfully ; but sink it under the chill , the annihilation of a Mr. , and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas . Well , shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year , by being up before they can begin ? \u201d Edmund met them with particular pleasure . It was the first time of his seeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintance which he had been hearing of with great satisfaction . A friendship between two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished : and to the credit of the lover \u2019s understanding , be it stated , that he did not by any means consider Fanny as the only , or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship . \u201c Well , \u201d said Miss Crawford , \u201c and do you not scold us for our imprudence ? What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it , and entreated and supplicated never to do so again ? \u201d \u201c Perhaps I might have scolded , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c if either of you had been sitting down alone ; but while you do wrong together , I can overlook a great deal . \u201d \u201c They can not have been sitting long , \u201d cried Mrs. Grant , \u201c for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window , and then they were walking . \u201d \u201c And really , \u201d added Edmund , \u201c the day is so mild , that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent . Our weather must not always be judged by the calendar . We may sometimes take greater liberties in November than in May . \u201d \u201c Upon my word , \u201d cried Miss Crawford , \u201c you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with ! There is no giving you a moment \u2019s uneasiness . You do not know how much we have been suffering , nor what chills we have felt ! But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on , in any little manoeuvre against common sense , that a woman could be plagued with . I had very little hope of _ him _ from the first ; but you , Mrs. Grant , my sister , my own sister , I think I had a right to alarm you a little . \u201d \u201c Do not flatter yourself , my dearest Mary . You have not the smallest chance of moving me . I have my alarms , but they are quite in a different quarter ; and if I could have altered the weather , you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time \u2014 for here are some of my plants which Robert _ will _ leave out because the nights are so mild , and I know the end of it will be , that we shall have a sudden change of weather , a hard frost setting in all at once , taking everybody ( at least Robert ) by surprise , and I shall lose every one ; and what is worse , cook has just been telling me that the turkey , which I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday , because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day , will not keep beyond to - morrow . These are something like grievances , and make me think the weather most unseasonably close . \u201d \u201c The sweets of housekeeping in a country village ! \u201d said Miss Crawford archly . \u201c Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer . \u201d \u201c My dear child , commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul \u2019s , and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be . But we have no such people in Mansfield . What would you have me do ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! you can do nothing but what you do already : be plagued very often , and never lose your temper . \u201d \u201c Thank you ; but there is no escaping these little vexations , Mary , live where we may ; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you , I dare say I shall find you with yours , in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer , perhaps on their very account . Their remoteness and unpunctuality , or their exorbitant charges and frauds , will be drawing forth bitter lamentations . \u201d \u201c I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort . A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of . It certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it . \u201d \u201c You intend to be very rich ? \u201d said Edmund , with a look which , to Fanny \u2019s eye , had a great deal of serious meaning . \u201c To be sure . Do not you ? Do not we all ? \u201d \u201c I can not intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command . Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth . She has only to fix on her number of thousands a year , and there can be no doubt of their coming . My intentions are only not to be poor . \u201d \u201c By moderation and economy , and bringing down your wants to your income , and all that . I understand you \u2014 and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life , with such limited means and indifferent connexions . What can _ you _ want but a decent maintenance ? You have not much time before you ; and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you , or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence . Be honest and poor , by all means \u2014 but I shall not envy you ; I do not much think I shall even respect you . I have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich . \u201d \u201c Your degree of respect for honesty , rich or poor , is precisely what I have no manner of concern with . I do not mean to be poor . Poverty is exactly what I have determined against . Honesty , in the something between , in the middle state of worldly circumstances , is all that I am anxious for your not looking down on . \u201d \u201c But I do look down upon it , if it might have been higher . I must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction . \u201d \u201c But how may it rise ? How may my honesty at least rise to any distinction ? \u201d This was not so very easy a question to answer , and occasioned an \u201c Oh ! \u201d of some length from the fair lady before she could add , \u201c You ought to be in parliament , or you should have gone into the army ten years ago . \u201d \u201c _ That _ is not much to the purpose now ; and as to my being in parliament , I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on . No , Miss Crawford , \u201d he added , in a more serious tone , \u201c there _ are _ distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance \u2014 absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining \u2014 but they are of a different character . \u201d A look of consciousness as he spoke , and what seemed a consciousness of manner on Miss Crawford \u2019s side as she made some laughing answer , was sorrowfull food for Fanny \u2019s observation ; and finding herself quite unable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant , by whose side she was now following the others , she had nearly resolved on going home immediately , and only waited for courage to say so , when the sound of the great clock at Mansfield Park , striking three , made her feel that she had really been much longer absent than usual , and brought the previous self - inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just then , and how , to a very speedy issue . With undoubting decision she directly began her adieus ; and Edmund began at the same time to recollect that his mother had been inquiring for her , and that he had walked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her back . Fanny \u2019s hurry increased ; and without in the least expecting Edmund \u2019s attendance , she would have hastened away alone ; but the general pace was quickened , and they all accompanied her into the house , through which it was necessary to pass . Dr. Grant was in the vestibule , and as they stopt to speak to him she found , from Edmund \u2019s manner , that he _ did _ mean to go with her . He too was taking leave . She could not but be thankful . In the moment of parting , Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his mutton with him the next day ; and Fanny had barely time for an unpleasant feeling on the occasion , when Mrs. Grant , with sudden recollection , turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company too . This was so new an attention , so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of Fanny \u2019s life , that she was all surprise and embarrassment ; and while stammering out her great obligation , and her \u201c but she did not suppose it would be in her power , \u201d was looking at Edmund for his opinion and help . But Edmund , delighted with her having such an happiness offered , and ascertaining with half a look , and half a sentence , that she had no objection but on her aunt \u2019s account , could not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing her , and therefore gave his decided open advice that the invitation should be accepted ; and though Fanny would not venture , even on his encouragement , to such a flight of audacious independence , it was soon settled , that if nothing were heard to the contrary , Mrs. Grant might expect her . \u201c And you know what your dinner will be , \u201d said Mrs. Grant , smiling\u2014\u201cthe turkey , and I assure you a very fine one ; for , my dear , \u201d turning to her husband , \u201c cook insists upon the turkey \u2019s being dressed to - morrow . \u201d \u201c Very well , very well , \u201d cried Dr. Grant , \u201c all the better ; I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house . But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram , I dare say , would take their chance . We none of us want to hear the bill of fare . A friendly meeting , and not a fine dinner , is all we have in view . A turkey , or a goose , or a leg of mutton , or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us . \u201d The two cousins walked home together ; and , except in the immediate discussion of this engagement , which Edmund spoke of with the warmest satisfaction , as so particularly desirable for her in the intimacy which he saw with so much pleasure established , it was a silent walk ; for having finished that subject , he grew thoughtful and indisposed for any other .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Fanny"}, {"position": [9, 10], "text": "her"}, {"position": [15, 16],
