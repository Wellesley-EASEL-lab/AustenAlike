{"document": "XXI Sir Thomas \u2019s return made a striking change in the ways of the family , independent of Lovers \u2019 Vows . Under his government , Mansfield was an altered place . Some members of their society sent away , and the spirits of many others saddened \u2014 it was all sameness and gloom compared with the past \u2014 a sombre family party rarely enlivened . There was little intercourse with the Parsonage . Sir Thomas , drawing back from intimacies in general , was particularly disinclined , at this time , for any engagements but in one quarter . The Rushworths were the only addition to his own domestic circle which he could solicit . Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father \u2019s feelings , nor could he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants . \u201c But they , \u201d he observed to Fanny , \u201c have a claim . They seem to belong to us ; they seem to be part of ourselves . I could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away . I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected . But the truth is , that my father hardly knows them . They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England . If he knew them better , he would value their society as it deserves ; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like . We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves : my sisters seem out of spirits , and Tom is certainly not at his ease . Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us , and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father . \u201d \u201c Do you think so ? \u201d said Fanny : \u201c in my opinion , my uncle would not like _ any _ addition . I think he values the very quietness you speak of , and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants . And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be \u2014 I mean before my uncle went abroad . As well as I can recollect , it was always much the same . There was never much laughing in his presence ; or , if there is any difference , it is not more , I think , than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first . There must be a sort of shyness ; but I can not recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry , except when my uncle was in town . No young people \u2019s are , I suppose , when those they look up to are at home \u201d . \u201c I believe you are right , Fanny , \u201d was his reply , after a short consideration . \u201c I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were , than assuming a new character . The novelty was in their being lively . Yet , how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give ! I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before . \u201d \u201c I suppose I am graver than other people , \u201d said Fanny . \u201c The evenings do not appear long to me . I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies . I could listen to him for an hour together . It entertains _ me _ more than many other things have done ; but then I am unlike other people , I dare say . \u201d \u201c Why should you dare say _ that _ ? \u201d ( smiling ) . \u201c Do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet ? But when did you , or anybody , ever get a compliment from me , Fanny ? Go to my father if you want to be complimented . He will satisfy you . Ask your uncle what he thinks , and you will hear compliments enough : and though they may be chiefly on your person , you must put up with it , and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time . \u201d Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her . \u201c Your uncle thinks you very pretty , dear Fanny \u2014 and that is the long and the short of the matter . Anybody but myself would have made something more of it , and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before ; but the truth is , that your uncle never did admire you till now \u2014 and now he does . Your complexion is so improved!\u2014and you have gained so much countenance!\u2014and your figure \u2014 nay , Fanny , do not turn away about it \u2014 it is but an uncle . If you can not bear an uncle \u2019s admiration , what is to become of you ? You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at . You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman . \u201d \u201c Oh ! do n\u2019t talk so , do n\u2019t talk so , \u201d cried Fanny , distressed by more feelings than he was aware of ; but seeing that she was distressed , he had done with the subject , and only added more seriously \u2014 \u201c Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect ; and I only wish you would talk to him more . You are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle . \u201d \u201c But I do talk to him more than I used . I am sure I do . Did not you hear me ask him about the slave - trade last night ? \u201d \u201c I did \u2014 and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others . It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther . \u201d \u201c And I longed to do it \u2014 but there was such a dead silence ! And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word , or seeming at all interested in the subject , I did not like \u2014 I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense , by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel . \u201d \u201c Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day : that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect . We were talking of you at the Parsonage , and those were her words . She has great discernment . I know nobody who distinguishes characters better . For so young a woman it is remarkable ! She certainly understands _ you _ better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long ; and with regard to some others , I can perceive , from occasional lively hints , the unguarded expressions of the moment , that she could define _ many _ as accurately , did not delicacy forbid it . I wonder what she thinks of my father ! She must admire him as a fine - looking man , with most gentlemanlike , dignified , consistent manners ; but perhaps , having seen him so seldom , his reserve may be a little repulsive . Could they be much together , I feel sure of their liking each other . He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers . I wish they met more frequently ! I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side . \u201d \u201c She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you , \u201d said Fanny , with half a sigh , \u201c to have any such apprehension . And Sir Thomas \u2019s wishing just at first to be only with his family , is so very natural , that she can argue nothing from that . After a little while , I dare say , we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way , allowing for the difference of the time of year . \u201d \u201c This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her infancy . I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . \u201d Fanny could have said a great deal , but it was safer to say nothing , and leave untouched all Miss Crawford \u2019s resources \u2014 her accomplishments , her spirits , her importance , her friends , lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome . Miss Crawford \u2019s kind opinion of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance , and she began to talk of something else . \u201c To - morrow , I think , my uncle dines at Sotherton , and you and Mr. Bertram too . We shall be quite a small party at home . I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth . \u201d \u201c That is impossible , Fanny . He must like him less after to - morrow \u2019s visit , for we shall be five hours in his company . I should dread the stupidity of the day , if there were not a much greater evil to follow \u2014 the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas . He can not much longer deceive himself . I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . \u201d In this quarter , indeed , disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas . Not all his good - will for Mr. Rushworth , not all Mr. Rushworth \u2019s deference for him , could prevent him from soon discerning some part of the truth \u2014 that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man , as ignorant in business as in books , with opinions in general unfixed , and without seeming much aware of it himself . He had expected a very different son - in - law ; and beginning to feel grave on Maria \u2019s account , tried to understand _ her _ feelings . Little observation there was necessary to tell him that indifference was the most favourable state they could be in . Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth was careless and cold . She could not , did not like him . Sir Thomas resolved to speak seriously to her . Advantageous as would be the alliance , and long standing and public as was the engagement , her happiness must not be sacrificed to it . Mr. Rushworth had , perhaps , been accepted on too short an acquaintance , and , on knowing him better , she was repenting . With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her : told her his fears , inquired into her wishes , entreated her to be open and sincere , and assured her that every inconvenience should be braved , and the connexion entirely given up , if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it . He would act for her and release her . Maria had a moment \u2019s struggle as she listened , and only a moment \u2019s : when her father ceased , she was able to give her answer immediately , decidedly , and with no apparent agitation . She thanked him for his great attention , his paternal kindness , but he was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking through her engagement , or was sensible of any change of opinion or inclination since her forming it . She had the highest esteem for Mr. Rushworth \u2019s character and disposition , and could not have a doubt of her happiness with him . Sir Thomas was satisfied ; too glad to be satisfied , perhaps , to urge the matter quite so far as his judgment might have dictated to others . It was an alliance which he could not have relinquished without pain ; and thus he reasoned . Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve . Mr. Rushworth must and would improve in good society ; and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness with him , speaking certainly without the prejudice , the blindness of love , she ought to be believed . Her feelings , probably , were not acute ; he had never supposed them to be so ; but her comforts might not be less on that account ; and if she could dispense with seeing her husband a leading , shining character , there would certainly be everything else in her favour . A well - disposed young woman , who did not marry for love , was in general but the more attached to her own family ; and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield must naturally hold out the greatest temptation , and would , in all probability , be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent enjoyments . Such and such - like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas , happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture , the wonder , the reflections , the reproach that must attend it ; happy to secure a marriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and influence , and very happy to think anything of his daughter \u2019s disposition that was most favourable for the purpose . To her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him . She was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall : that she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton ; that she was safe from the possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions , and destroying her prospects ; and retired in proud resolve , determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future , that her father might not be again suspecting her . Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after Henry Crawford \u2019s leaving Mansfield , before her feelings were at all tranquillised , before she had given up every hope of him , or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival , her answer might have been different ; but after another three or four days , when there was no return , no letter , no message , no symptom of a softened heart , no hope of advantage from separation , her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self revenge could give . Henry Crawford had destroyed her happiness , but he should not know that he had done it ; he should not destroy her credit , her appearance , her prosperity , too . He should not have to think of her as pining in the retirement of Mansfield for _ him _ , rejecting Sotherton and London , independence and splendour , for _ his _ sake . Independence was more needful than ever ; the want of it at Mansfield more sensibly felt . She was less and less able to endure the restraint which her father imposed . The liberty which his absence had given was now become absolutely necessary . She must escape from him and Mansfield as soon as possible , and find consolation in fortune and consequence , bustle and the world , for a wounded spirit . Her mind was quite determined , and varied not . To such feelings delay , even the delay of much preparation , would have been an evil , and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the marriage than herself . In all the important preparations of the mind she was complete : being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home , restraint , and tranquillity ; by the misery of disappointed affection , and contempt of the man she was to marry . The rest might wait . The preparations of new carriages and furniture might wait for London and spring , when her own taste could have fairer play . The principals being all agreed in this respect , it soon appeared that a very few weeks would be sufficient for such arrangements as must precede the wedding . Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire , and make way for the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected ; and very early in November removed herself , her maid , her footman , and her chariot , with true dowager propriety , to Bath , there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her evening parties ; enjoying them as thoroughly , perhaps , in the animation of a card - table , as she had ever done on the spot ; and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another mistress . It was a very proper wedding . The bride was elegantly dressed ; the two bridesmaids were duly inferior ; her father gave her away ; her mother stood with salts in her hand , expecting to be agitated ; her aunt tried to cry ; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant . Nothing could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the neighbourhood , except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia from the church - door to Sotherton was the same chaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before . In everything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictest investigation . It was done , and they were gone . Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father must feel , and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his wife had been apprehensive of for herself , but had fortunately escaped . Mrs. Norris , most happy to assist in the duties of the day , by spending it at the Park to support her sister \u2019s spirits , and drinking the health of Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two , was all joyous delight ; for she had made the match ; she had done everything ; and no one would have supposed , from her confident triumph , that she had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life , or could have the smallest insight into the disposition of the niece who had been brought up under her eye . The plan of the young couple was to proceed , after a few days , to Brighton , and take a house there for some weeks . Every public place was new to Maria , and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer . When the novelty of amusement there was over , it would be time for the wider range of London . Julia was to go with them to Brighton . Since rivalry between the sisters had ceased , they had been gradually recovering much of their former good understanding ; and were at least sufficiently friends to make each of them exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time . Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady ; and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria , though she might not have struggled through so much to obtain them , and could better bear a subordinate situation . Their departure made another material change at Mansfield , a chasm which required some time to fill up . The family circle became greatly contracted ; and though the Miss Bertrams had latterly added little to its gaiety , they could not but be missed . Even their mother missed them ; and how much more their tenderhearted cousin , who wandered about the house , and thought of them , and felt for them , with a degree of affectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve !", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Sir Thomas"}, {"position": [23, 24], "text": "his"}, {"position": [74, 76], "text": "Sir Thomas"},
