{"document": "XV Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily ; and soon after Miss Bertram \u2019s return from the Parsonage , Mr. Rushworth arrived , and another character was consequently cast . He had the offer of Count Cassel and Anhalt , and at first did not know which to chuse , and wanted Miss Bertram to direct him ; but upon being made to understand the different style of the characters , and which was which , and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London , and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow , he soon decided for the Count . Miss Bertram approved the decision , for the less he had to learn the better ; and though she could not sympathise in his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act together , nor wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over the leaves with the hope of still discovering such a scene , she very kindly took his part in hand , and curtailed every speech that admitted being shortened ; besides pointing out the necessity of his being very much dressed , and chusing his colours . Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well , though affecting to despise it ; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others , or draw any of those conclusions , or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for . Thus much was settled before Edmund , who had been out all the morning , knew anything of the matter ; but when he entered the drawing - room before dinner , the buzz of discussion was high between Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates ; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable news . \u201c We have got a play , \u201d said he . \u201c It is to be Lovers \u2019 Vows ; and I am to be Count Cassel , and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak , and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit , by way of a shooting - dress . I do not know how I shall like it . \u201d Fanny \u2019s eyes followed Edmund , and her heart beat for him as she heard this speech , and saw his look , and felt what his sensations must be . \u201c Lovers \u2019 Vows ! \u201d in a tone of the greatest amazement , was his only reply to Mr. Rushworth , and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if hardly doubting a contradiction . \u201c Yes , \u201d cried Mr. Yates . \u201c After all our debatings and difficulties , we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well , nothing so unexceptionable , as Lovers \u2019 Vows . The wonder is that it should not have been thought of before . My stupidity was abominable , for here we have all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford ; and it is so useful to have anything of a model ! We have cast almost every part . \u201d \u201c But what do you do for women ? \u201d said Edmund gravely , and looking at Maria . Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered , \u201c I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and \u201d ( with a bolder eye ) \u201c Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . \u201d \u201c I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , \u201d replied Edmund , turning away to the fire , where sat his mother , aunt , and Fanny , and seating himself with a look of great vexation . Mr. Rushworth followed him to say , \u201c I come in three times , and have two - and - forty speeches . That \u2019s something , is not it ? But I do not much like the idea of being so fine . I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak . \u201d Edmund could not answer him . In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , \u201c I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up . I can not but suppose you _ will _ when you have read it carefully over . Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt , and see how you can approve it . It will not be necessary to send you to your _ father \u2019s _ judgment , I am convinced . \u201d \u201c We see things very differently , \u201d cried Maria . \u201c I am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and _ I _ am not the _ only _ young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . \u201d \u201c I am sorry for it , \u201d was his answer ; \u201c but in this matter it is _ you _ who are to lead . _ You _ must set the example . If others have blundered , it is your place to put them right , and shew them what true delicacy is . In all points of decorum _ your _ conduct must be law to the rest of the party . \u201d This picture of her consequence had some effect , for no one loved better to lead than Maria ; and with far more good - humour she answered , \u201c I am much obliged to you , Edmund ; you mean very well , I am sure : but I still think you see things too strongly ; and I really can not undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind . _ There _ would be the greatest indecorum , I think . \u201d \u201c Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head ? No ; let your conduct be the only harangue . Say that , on examining the part , you feel yourself unequal to it ; that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have . Say this with firmness , and it will be quite enough . All who can distinguish will understand your motive . The play will be given up , and your delicacy honoured as it ought . \u201d \u201c Do not act anything improper , my dear , \u201d said Lady Bertram . \u201c Sir Thomas would not like it.\u2014Fanny , ring the bell ; I must have my dinner.\u2014To be sure , Julia is dressed by this time . \u201d \u201c I am convinced , madam , \u201d said Edmund , preventing Fanny , \u201c that Sir Thomas would not like it . \u201d \u201c There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? \u201d \u201c If I were to decline the part , \u201d said Maria , with renewed zeal , \u201c Julia would certainly take it . \u201d \u201c What ! \u201d cried Edmund , \u201c if she knew your reasons ! \u201d \u201c Oh ! she might think the difference between us \u2014 the difference in our situations \u2014 that _ she _ need not be so scrupulous as _ I _ might feel necessary . I am sure she would argue so . No ; you must excuse me ; I can not retract my consent ; it is too far settled , everybody would be so disappointed , Tom would be quite angry ; and if we are so very nice , we shall never act anything . \u201d \u201c I was just going to say the very same thing , \u201d said Mrs. Norris . \u201c If every play is to be objected to , you will act nothing , and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away , and I am sure _ that _ would be a discredit to us all . I do not know the play ; but , as Maria says , if there is anything a little too warm ( and it is so with most of them ) it can be easily left out . We must not be over - precise , Edmund . As Mr. Rushworth is to act too , there can be no harm . I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day \u2019s work about those side - doors . The curtain will be a good job , however . The maids do their work very well , and I think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings . There is no occasion to put them so very close together . I _ am _ of some use , I hope , in preventing waste and making the most of things . There should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones . I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day . I had been looking about me in the poultry - yard , and was just coming out , when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants \u2019 hall - door with two bits of deal board in his hand , bringing them to father , you may be sure ; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father , and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board , for he could not no how do without them . I knew what all this meant , for the servants \u2019 dinner - bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads ; and as I hate such encroaching people ( the Jacksons are very encroaching , I have always said so : just the sort of people to get all they can ) , I said to the boy directly ( a great lubberly fellow of ten years old , you know , who ought to be ashamed of himself ) , \u2018 _ I \u2019ll _ take the boards to your father , Dick , so get you home again as fast as you can . \u2019 The boy looked very silly , and turned away without offering a word , for I believe I might speak pretty sharp ; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while . I hate such greediness \u2014 so good as your father is to the family , employing the man all the year round ! \u201d Nobody was at the trouble of an answer ; the others soon returned ; and Edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only satisfaction . Dinner passed heavily . Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick Jackson , but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked of , for Edmund \u2019s disapprobation was felt even by his brother , though he would not have owned it . Maria , wanting Henry Crawford \u2019s animating support , thought the subject better avoided . Mr. Yates , who was trying to make himself agreeable to Julia , found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company ; and Mr. Rushworth , having only his own part and his own dress in his head , had soon talked away all that could be said of either . But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . \u201c Well , how do you go on ? \u201d and \u201c What have you settled ? \u201d and \u201c Oh ! we can do nothing without you , \u201d followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ . \u201c I must really congratulate your ladyship , \u201d said she , \u201c on the play being chosen ; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience , I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties . The actors may be glad , but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision ; and I do sincerely give you joy , madam , as well as Mrs. Norris , and everybody else who is in the same predicament , \u201d glancing half fearfully , half slyly , beyond Fanny to Edmund . She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram , but Edmund said nothing . His being only a bystander was not disclaimed . After continuing in chat with the party round the fire a few minutes , Miss Crawford returned to the party round the table ; and standing by them , seemed to interest herself in their arrangements till , as if struck by a sudden recollection , she exclaimed , \u201c My good friends , you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses , inside and out ; but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile . Who is to be Anhalt ? What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to ? \u201d For a moment no one spoke ; and then many spoke together to tell the same melancholy truth , that they had not yet got any Anhalt . \u201c Mr. Rushworth was to be Count Cassel , but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt . \u201d \u201c I had my choice of the parts , \u201d said Mr. Rushworth ; \u201c but I thought I should like the Count best , though I do not much relish the finery I am to have . \u201d \u201c You chose very wisely , I am sure , \u201d replied Miss Crawford , with a brightened look ; \u201c Anhalt is a heavy part . \u201d \u201c _ The _ _ Count _ has two - and - forty speeches , \u201d returned Mr. Rushworth , \u201c which is no trifle . \u201d \u201c I am not at all surprised , \u201d said Miss Crawford , after a short pause , \u201c at this want of an Anhalt . Amelia deserves no better . Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men . \u201d \u201c I should be but too happy in taking the part , if it were possible , \u201d cried Tom ; \u201c but , unluckily , the Butler and Anhalt are in together . I will not entirely give it up , however ; I will try what can be done \u2014 I will look it over again . \u201d \u201c Your _ brother _ should take the part , \u201d said Mr. Yates , in a low voice . \u201c Do not you think he would ? \u201d \u201c _ I _ shall not ask him , \u201d replied Tom , in a cold , determined manner . Miss Crawford talked of something else , and soon afterwards rejoined the party at the fire . \u201c They do not want me at all , \u201d said she , seating herself . \u201c I only puzzle them , and oblige them to make civil speeches . Mr. Edmund Bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and , therefore , I apply to _ you _ . What shall we do for an Anhalt ? Is it practicable for any of the others to double it ? What is your advice ? \u201d \u201c My advice , \u201d said he calmly , \u201c is that you change the play . \u201d \u201c _ I _ should have no objection , \u201d she replied ; \u201c for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ \u201d ( looking round ) , \u201c it certainly will not be taken . \u201d Edmund said no more . \u201c If _ any _ part could tempt _ you _ to act , I suppose it would be Anhalt , \u201d observed the lady archly , after a short pause ; \u201c for he is a clergyman , you know . \u201d \u201c _ That _ circumstance would by no means tempt me , \u201d he replied , \u201c for I should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting . It must be very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal , solemn lecturer ; and the man who chuses the profession itself is , perhaps , one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage . \u201d Miss Crawford was silenced , and with some feelings of resentment and mortification , moved her chair considerably nearer the tea - table , and gave all her attention to Mrs. Norris , who was presiding there . \u201c Fanny , \u201d cried Tom Bertram , from the other table , where the conference was eagerly carrying on , and the conversation incessant , \u201c we want your services . \u201d Fanny was up in a moment , expecting some errand ; for the habit of employing her in that way was not yet overcome , in spite of all that Edmund could do . \u201c Oh ! we do not want to disturb you from your seat . We do not want your _ present _ services . We shall only want you in our play . You must be Cottager \u2019s wife . \u201d \u201c Me ! \u201d cried Fanny , sitting down again with a most frightened look . \u201c Indeed you must excuse me . I could not act anything if you were to give me the world . No , indeed , I can not act . \u201d \u201c Indeed , but you must , for we can not excuse you . It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . \u201d \u201c If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , \u201d cried Mr. Rushworth , \u201c what would you do with such a part as mine ? I have forty - two to learn . \u201d \u201c It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart , \u201d said Fanny , shocked to find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room , and to feel that almost every eye was upon her ; \u201c but I really can not act . \u201d \u201c Yes , yes , you can act well enough for _ us _ . Learn your part , and we will teach you all the rest . You have only two scenes , and as I shall be Cottager , I \u2019ll put you in and push you about , and you will do it very well , I \u2019ll answer for it . \u201d \u201c No , indeed , Mr. Bertram , you must excuse me . You can not have an idea . It would be absolutely impossible for me . If I were to undertake it , I should only disappoint you . \u201d \u201c Phoo ! Phoo ! Do not be so shamefaced . You \u2019ll do it very well . Every allowance will be made for you . We do not expect perfection . You must get a brown gown , and a white apron , and a mob cap , and we must make you a few wrinkles , and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes , and you will be a very proper , little old woman . \u201d \u201c You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , \u201d cried Fanny , growing more and more red from excessive agitation , and looking distressfully at Edmund , who was kindly observing her ; but unwilling to exasperate his brother by interference , gave her only an encouraging smile . Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible\u2014\u201cWhat a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort \u2014 so kind as they are to you ! Take the part with a good grace , and let us hear no more of the matter , I entreat . \u201d \u201c Do not urge her , madam , \u201d said Edmund . \u201c It is not fair to urge her in this manner . You see she does not like to act . Let her chuse for herself , as well as the rest of us . Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted . Do not urge her any more . \u201d \u201c I am not going to urge her , \u201d replied Mrs. Norris sharply ; \u201c but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her \u2014 very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is . \u201d Edmund was too angry to speak ; but Miss Crawford , looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris , and then at Fanny , whose tears were beginning to shew themselves , immediately said , with some keenness , \u201c I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , \u201d and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table , close to Fanny , saying to her , in a kind , low whisper , as she placed herself , \u201c Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them \u201d ; and with pointed attention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits , in spite of being out of spirits herself . By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board , and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund \u2019s favour . Fanny did not love Miss Crawford ; but she felt very much obliged to her for her present kindness ; and when , from taking notice of her work , and wishing _ she _ could work as well , and begging for the pattern , and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _ appearance _ , as of course she would come out when her cousin was married , Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea , and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him , and imagined him a very fine young man , and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again \u2014 she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery , or help listening , and answering with more animation than she had intended . The consultation upon the play still went on , and Miss Crawford \u2019s attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram \u2019s telling her , with infinite regret , that he found it absolutely impossible for him to undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler : he had been most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible , but it would not do ; he must give it up . \u201c But there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it , \u201d he added . \u201c We have but to speak the word ; we may pick and chuse . I could name , at this moment , at least six young men within six miles of us , who are wild to be admitted into our company , and there are one or two that would not disgrace us : I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox . Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow , and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere , so I will take my horse early to - morrow morning and ride over to Stoke , and settle with one of them . \u201d While he spoke , Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this : so contrary to all their first protestations ; but Edmund said nothing . After a moment \u2019s thought , Miss Crawford calmly replied , \u201c As far as I am concerned , I can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible . Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen ? Yes , Mr. Charles Maddox dined at my sister \u2019s one day , did not he , Henry ? A quiet - looking young man . I remember him . Let _ him _ be applied to , if you please , for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger . \u201d Charles Maddox was to be the man . Tom repeated his resolution of going to him early on the morrow ; and though Julia , who had scarcely opened her lips before , observed , in a sarcastic manner , and with a glance first at Maria and then at Edmund , that \u201c the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , \u201d Edmund still held his peace , and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity . \u201c I am not very sanguine as to our play , \u201d said Miss Crawford , in an undervoice to Fanny , after some consideration ; \u201c and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of _ his _ speeches , and a great many of _ my _ _ own _ , before we rehearse together . It will be very disagreeable , and by no means what I expected . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [20, 22], "text": "Mr. Rushworth"}, {"position": [31, 32], "text": "He"}, {"position":
