{"document": "XX Edmund \u2019s first object the next morning was to see his father alone , and give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme , defending his own share in it as far only as he could then , in a soberer moment , feel his motives to deserve , and acknowledging , with perfect ingenuousness , that his concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his judgment in it very doubtful . He was anxious , while vindicating himself , to say nothing unkind of the others : but there was only one amongst them whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defence or palliation . \u201c We have all been more or less to blame , \u201d said he , \u201c every one of us , excepting Fanny . Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout ; who has been consistent . _ Her _ feelings have been steadily against it from first to last . She never ceased to think of what was due to you . You will find Fanny everything you could wish . \u201d Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party , and at such a time , as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must ; he felt it too much , indeed , for many words ; and having shaken hands with Edmund , meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression , and forget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could , after the house had been cleared of every object enforcing the remembrance , and restored to its proper state . He did not enter into any remonstrance with his other children : he was more willing to believe they felt their error than to run the risk of investigation . The reproof of an immediate conclusion of everything , the sweep of every preparation , would be sufficient . There was one person , however , in the house , whom he could not leave to learn his sentiments merely through his conduct . He could not help giving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having hoped that her advice might have been interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly have disapproved . The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming the plan ; they ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves ; but they were young ; and , excepting Edmund , he believed , of unsteady characters ; and with greater surprise , therefore , he must regard her acquiescence in their wrong measures , her countenance of their unsafe amusements , than that such measures and such amusements should have been suggested . Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life ; for she was ashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was so glaring to Sir Thomas , and would not have admitted that her influence was insufficient \u2014 that she might have talked in vain . Her only resource was to get out of the subject as fast as possible , and turn the current of Sir Thomas \u2019s ideas into a happier channel . She had a great deal to insinuate in her own praise as to _ general _ attention to the interest and comfort of his family , much exertion and many sacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from her own fireside , and many excellent hints of distrust and economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail , whereby a most considerable saving had always arisen , and more than one bad servant been detected . But her chief strength lay in Sotherton . Her greatest support and glory was in having formed the connexion with the Rushworths . _ There _ she was impregnable . She took to herself all the credit of bringing Mr. Rushworth \u2019s admiration of Maria to any effect . \u201c If I had not been active , \u201d said she , \u201c and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle . But I left no stone unturned . I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister , and at last I did persuade her . You know the distance to Sotherton ; it was in the middle of winter , and the roads almost impassable , but I did persuade her . \u201d \u201c I know how great , how justly great , your influence is with Lady Bertram and her children , and am the more concerned that it should not have been \u2014 \u201d \u201c My dear Sir Thomas , if you had seen the state of the roads _ that _ day ! I thought we should never have got through them , though we had the four horses of course ; and poor old coachman would attend us , out of his great love and kindness , though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas . I cured him at last ; but he was very bad all the winter \u2014 and this was such a day , I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture : he was putting on his wig ; so I said , \u2018 Coachman , you had much better not go ; your Lady and I shall be very safe ; you know how steady Stephen is , and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now , that I am sure there is no fear . \u2019 But , however , I soon found it would not do ; he was bent upon going , and as I hate to be worrying and officious , I said no more ; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt , and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke , where , what with frost and snow upon beds of stones , it was worse than anything you can imagine , I was quite in an agony about him . And then the poor horses too ! To see them straining away ! You know how I always feel for the horses . And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill , what do you think I did ? You will laugh at me ; but I got out and walked up . I did indeed . It might not be saving them much , but it was something , and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals . I caught a dreadful cold , but _ that _ I did not regard . My object was accomplished in the visit . \u201d \u201c I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it . There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth \u2019s manners , but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject : his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting . He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish . \u201d \u201c Yes , indeed , and the more you know of him the better you will like him . He is not a shining character , but he has a thousand good qualities ; and is so disposed to look up to you , that I am quite laughed at about it , for everybody considers it as my doing . \u2018 Upon my word , Mrs. Norris , \u2019 said Mrs. Grant the other day , \u2018 if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own , he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect . \u2019 \u201d Sir Thomas gave up the point , foiled by her evasions , disarmed by her flattery ; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that where the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake , her kindness did sometimes overpower her judgment . It was a busy morning with him . Conversation with any of them occupied but a small part of it . He had to reinstate himself in all the wonted concerns of his Mansfield life : to see his steward and his bailiff ; to examine and compute , and , in the intervals of business , to walk into his stables and his gardens , and nearest plantations ; but active and methodical , he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat as master of the house at dinner , he had also set the carpenter to work in pulling down what had been so lately put up in the billiard - room , and given the scene - painter his dismissal long enough to justify the pleasing belief of his being then at least as far off as Northampton . The scene - painter was gone , having spoilt only the floor of one room , ruined all the coachman \u2019s sponges , and made five of the under - servants idle and dissatisfied ; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or two would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been , even to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers \u2019 Vows in the house , for he was burning all that met his eye . Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas \u2019s intentions , though as far as ever from understanding their source . He and his friend had been out with their guns the chief of the morning , and Tom had taken the opportunity of explaining , with proper apologies for his father \u2019s particularity , what was to be expected . Mr. Yates felt it as acutely as might be supposed . To be a second time disappointed in the same way was an instance of very severe ill - luck ; and his indignation was such , that had it not been for delicacy towards his friend , and his friend \u2019s youngest sister , he believed he should certainly attack the baronet on the absurdity of his proceedings , and argue him into a little more rationality . He believed this very stoutly while he was in Mansfield Wood , and all the way home ; but there was a something in Sir Thomas , when they sat round the same table , which made Mr. Yates think it wiser to let him pursue his own way , and feel the folly of it without opposition . He had known many disagreeable fathers before , and often been struck with the inconveniences they occasioned , but never , in the whole course of his life , had he seen one of that class so unintelligibly moral , so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas . He was not a man to be endured but for his children \u2019s sake , and he might be thankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof . The evening passed with external smoothness , though almost every mind was ruffled ; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony . Maria was in a good deal of agitation . It was of the utmost consequence to her that Crawford should now lose no time in declaring himself , and she was disturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance that point . She had been expecting to see him the whole morning , and all the evening , too , was still expecting him . Mr. Rushworth had set off early with the great news for Sotherton ; and she had fondly hoped for such an immediate _ eclaircissement _ as might save him the trouble of ever coming back again . But they had seen no one from the Parsonage , not a creature , and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of congratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram . It was the first day for many , many weeks , in which the families had been wholly divided . Four - and - twenty hours had never passed before , since August began , without bringing them together in some way or other . It was a sad , anxious day ; and the morrow , though differing in the sort of evil , did by no means bring less . A few moments of feverish enjoyment were followed by hours of acute suffering . Henry Crawford was again in the house : he walked up with Dr. Grant , who was anxious to pay his respects to Sir Thomas , and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the breakfast - room , where were most of the family . Sir Thomas soon appeared , and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of the man she loved to her father . Her sensations were indefinable , and so were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford , who had a chair between herself and Tom , ask the latter in an undervoice whether there were any plans for resuming the play after the present happy interruption ( with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas ) , because , in that case , he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time required by the party : he was going away immediately , being to meet his uncle at Bath without delay ; but if there were any prospect of a renewal of Lovers \u2019 Vows , he should hold himself positively engaged , he should break through every other claim , he should absolutely condition with his uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted . The play should not be lost by _ his _ absence . \u201c From Bath , Norfolk , London , York , wherever I may be , \u201d said he ; \u201c I will attend you from any place in England , at an hour \u2019s notice . \u201d It was well at that moment that Tom had to speak , and not his sister . He could immediately say with easy fluency , \u201c I am sorry you are going ; but as to our play , _ that _ is all over \u2014 entirely at an end \u201d ( looking significantly at his father ) . \u201c The painter was sent off yesterday , and very little will remain of the theatre to - morrow . I knew how _ that _ would be from the first . It is early for Bath . You will find nobody there . \u201d \u201c It is about my uncle \u2019s usual time . \u201d \u201c When do you think of going ? \u201d \u201c I may , perhaps , get as far as Banbury to - day . \u201d \u201c Whose stables do you use at Bath ? \u201d was the next question ; and while this branch of the subject was under discussion , Maria , who wanted neither pride nor resolution , was preparing to encounter her share of it with tolerable calmness . To her he soon turned , repeating much of what he had already said , with only a softened air and stronger expressions of regret . But what availed his expressions or his air ? He was going , and , if not voluntarily going , voluntarily intending to stay away ; for , excepting what might be due to his uncle , his engagements were all self - imposed . He might talk of necessity , but she knew his independence . The hand which had so pressed hers to his heart ! the hand and the heart were alike motionless and passive now ! Her spirit supported her , but the agony of her mind was severe . She had not long to endure what arose from listening to language which his actions contradicted , or to bury the tumult of her feelings under the restraint of society ; for general civilities soon called his notice from her , and the farewell visit , as it then became openly acknowledged , was a very short one . He was gone \u2014 he had touched her hand for the last time , he had made his parting bow , and she might seek directly all that solitude could do for her . Henry Crawford was gone , gone from the house , and within two hours afterwards from the parish ; and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised in Maria and Julia Bertram . Julia could rejoice that he was gone . His presence was beginning to be odious to her ; and if Maria gained him not , she was now cool enough to dispense with any other revenge . She did not want exposure to be added to desertion . Henry Crawford gone , she could even pity her sister . With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence . She heard it at dinner , and felt it a blessing . By all the others it was mentioned with regret ; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling \u2014 from the sincerity of Edmund \u2019s too partial regard , to the unconcern of his mother speaking entirely by rote . Mrs. Norris began to look about her , and wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing ; and could almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it ; but with so many to care for , how was it possible for even _ her _ activity to keep pace with her wishes ? Another day or two , and Mr. Yates was gone likewise . In _ his _ departure Sir Thomas felt the chief interest : wanting to be alone with his family , the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been irksome ; but of him , trifling and confident , idle and expensive , it was every way vexatious . In himself he was wearisome , but as the friend of Tom and the admirer of Julia he became offensive . Sir Thomas had been quite indifferent to Mr. Crawford \u2019s going or staying : but his good wishes for Mr. Yates \u2019s having a pleasant journey , as he walked with him to the hall - door , were given with genuine satisfaction . Mr. Yates had staid to see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield , the removal of everything appertaining to the play : he left the house in all the soberness of its general character ; and Sir Thomas hoped , in seeing him out of it , to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme , and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of its existence . Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that might have distressed him . The curtain , over which she had presided with such talent and such success , went off with her to her cottage , where she happened to be particularly in want of green baize .", "clusters":
