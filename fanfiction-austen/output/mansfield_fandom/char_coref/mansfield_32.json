{"document": "XXXII Fanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she awoke the next morning ; but she remembered the purport of her note , and was not less sanguine as to its effect than she had been the night before . If Mr. Crawford would but go away ! That was what she most earnestly desired : go and take his sister with him , as he was to do , and as he returned to Mansfield on purpose to do . And why it was not done already she could not devise , for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay . Fanny had hoped , in the course of his yesterday \u2019s visit , to hear the day named ; but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere long . Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey , she could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford , as she accidentally did , coming up to the house again , and at an hour as early as the day before . His coming might have nothing to do with her , but she must avoid seeing him if possible ; and being then on her way upstairs , she resolved there to remain , during the whole of his visit , unless actually sent for ; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house , there seemed little danger of her being wanted . She sat some time in a good deal of agitation , listening , trembling , and fearing to be sent for every moment ; but as no footsteps approached the East room , she grew gradually composed , could sit down , and be able to employ herself , and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and would go without her being obliged to know anything of the matter . Nearly half an hour had passed , and she was growing very comfortable , when suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard ; a heavy step , an unusual step in that part of the house : it was her uncle \u2019s ; she knew it as well as his voice ; she had trembled at it as often , and began to tremble again , at the idea of his coming up to speak to her , whatever might be the subject . It was indeed Sir Thomas who opened the door and asked if she were there , and if he might come in . The terror of his former occasional visits to that room seemed all renewed , and she felt as if he were going to examine her again in French and English . She was all attention , however , in placing a chair for him , and trying to appear honoured ; and , in her agitation , had quite overlooked the deficiencies of her apartment , till he , stopping short as he entered , said , with much surprise , \u201c Why have you no fire to - day ? \u201d There was snow on the ground , and she was sitting in a shawl . She hesitated . \u201c I am not cold , sir : I never sit here long at this time of year . \u201d \u201c But you have a fire in general ? \u201d \u201c No , sir . \u201d \u201c How comes this about ? Here must be some mistake . I understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable . In your bedchamber I know you _ can not _ have a fire . Here is some great misapprehension which must be rectified . It is highly unfit for you to sit , be it only half an hour a day , without a fire . You are not strong . You are chilly . Your aunt can not be aware of this . \u201d Fanny would rather have been silent ; but being obliged to speak , she could not forbear , in justice to the aunt she loved best , from saying something in which the words \u201c my aunt Norris \u201d were distinguishable . \u201c I understand , \u201d cried her uncle , recollecting himself , and not wanting to hear more : \u201c I understand . Your aunt Norris has always been an advocate , and very judiciously , for young people \u2019s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences ; but there should be moderation in everything . She is also very hardy herself , which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others . And on another account , too , I can perfectly comprehend . I know what her sentiments have always been . The principle was good in itself , but it may have been , and I believe _ has _ _ been _ , carried too far in your case . I am aware that there has been sometimes , in some points , a misplaced distinction ; but I think too well of you , Fanny , to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account . You have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part , and judging partially by the event . You will take in the whole of the past , you will consider times , persons , and probabilities , and you will feel that _ they _ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which _ seemed _ to be your lot . Though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary , it was kindly meant ; and of this you may be assured , that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been imposed . I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you , by failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and attention that are due to her . But enough of this . Sit down , my dear . I must speak to you for a few minutes , but I will not detain you long . \u201d Fanny obeyed , with eyes cast down and colour rising . After a moment \u2019s pause , Sir Thomas , trying to suppress a smile , went on . \u201c You are not aware , perhaps , that I have had a visitor this morning . I had not been long in my own room , after breakfast , when Mr. Crawford was shewn in . His errand you may probably conjecture . \u201d Fanny \u2019s colour grew deeper and deeper ; and her uncle , perceiving that she was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up quite impossible , turned away his own eyes , and without any farther pause proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford \u2019s visit . Mr. Crawford \u2019s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny , make decided proposals for her , and entreat the sanction of the uncle , who seemed to stand in the place of her parents ; and he had done it all so well , so openly , so liberally , so properly , that Sir Thomas , feeling , moreover , his own replies , and his own remarks to have been very much to the purpose , was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their conversation ; and little aware of what was passing in his niece \u2019s mind , conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than himself . He talked , therefore , for several minutes without Fanny \u2019s daring to interrupt him . She had hardly even attained the wish to do it . Her mind was in too much confusion . She had changed her position ; and , with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows , was listening to her uncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay . For a moment he ceased , but she had barely become conscious of it , when , rising from his chair , he said , \u201c And now , Fanny , having performed one part of my commission , and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory , I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs , where , though I can not but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself , I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to . Mr. Crawford , as you have perhaps foreseen , is yet in the house . He is in my room , and hoping to see you there . \u201d There was a look , a start , an exclamation on hearing this , which astonished Sir Thomas ; but what was his increase of astonishment on hearing her exclaim\u2014\u201cOh ! no , sir , I can not , indeed I can not go down to him . Mr. Crawford ought to know \u2014 he must know that : I told him enough yesterday to convince him ; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday , and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me , and quite out of my power to return his good opinion . \u201d \u201c I do not catch your meaning , \u201d said Sir Thomas , sitting down again . \u201c Out of your power to return his good opinion ? What is all this ? I know he spoke to you yesterday , and ( as far as I understand ) received as much encouragement to proceed as a well - judging young woman could permit herself to give . I was very much pleased with what I collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion ; it shewed a discretion highly to be commended . But now , when he has made his overtures so properly , and honourably \u2014 what are your scruples _ now _ ? \u201d \u201c You are mistaken , sir , \u201d cried Fanny , forced by the anxiety of the moment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong ; \u201c you are quite mistaken . How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing ? I gave him no encouragement yesterday . On the contrary , I told him , I can not recollect my exact words , but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him , that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect , and that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again . I am sure I said as much as that and more ; and I should have said still more , if I had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously ; but I did not like to be , I could not bear to be , imputing more than might be intended . I thought it might all pass for nothing with _ him _ . \u201d She could say no more ; her breath was almost gone . \u201c Am I to understand , \u201d said Sir Thomas , after a few moments \u2019 silence , \u201c that you mean to _ refuse _ Mr. Crawford ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir . \u201d \u201c Refuse him ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir . \u201d \u201c Refuse Mr. Crawford ! Upon what plea ? For what reason ? \u201d \u201c I \u2014 I can not like him , sir , well enough to marry him . \u201d \u201c This is very strange ! \u201d said Sir Thomas , in a voice of calm displeasure . \u201c There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach . Here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you , with everything to recommend him : not merely situation in life , fortune , and character , but with more than common agreeableness , with address and conversation pleasing to everybody . And he is not an acquaintance of to - day ; you have now known him some time . His sister , moreover , is your intimate friend , and he has been doing _ that _ for your brother , which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you , had there been no other . It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William on . He has done it already . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d said Fanny , in a faint voice , and looking down with fresh shame ; and she did feel almost ashamed of herself , after such a picture as her uncle had drawn , for not liking Mr. Crawford . \u201c You must have been aware , \u201d continued Sir Thomas presently , \u201c you must have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford \u2019s manners to you . This can not have taken you by surprise . You must have observed his attentions ; and though you always received them very properly ( I have no accusation to make on that head ) , I never perceived them to be unpleasant to you . I am half inclined to think , Fanny , that you do not quite know your own feelings . \u201d \u201c Oh yes , sir ! indeed I do . His attentions were always \u2014 what I did not like . \u201d Sir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise . \u201c This is beyond me , \u201d said he . \u201c This requires explanation . Young as you are , and having seen scarcely any one , it is hardly possible that your affections \u2014 \u201d He paused and eyed her fixedly . He saw her lips formed into a _ no _ , though the sound was inarticulate , but her face was like scarlet . That , however , in so modest a girl , might be very compatible with innocence ; and chusing at least to appear satisfied , he quickly added , \u201c No , no , I know _ that _ is quite out of the question ; quite impossible . Well , there is nothing more to be said . \u201d And for a few minutes he did say nothing . He was deep in thought . His niece was deep in thought likewise , trying to harden and prepare herself against farther questioning . She would rather die than own the truth ; and she hoped , by a little reflection , to fortify herself beyond betraying it . \u201c Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford \u2019s _ choice _ seemed to justify \u201d said Sir Thomas , beginning again , and very composedly , \u201c his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me . I am an advocate for early marriages , where there are means in proportion , and would have every young man , with a sufficient income , settle as soon after four - and - twenty as he can . This is so much my opinion , that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son , your cousin , Mr. Bertram , is to marry early ; but at present , as far as I can judge , matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts . I wish he were more likely to fix . \u201d Here was a glance at Fanny . \u201c Edmund , I consider , from his dispositions and habits , as much more likely to marry early than his brother . _ He _ , indeed , I have lately thought , has seen the woman he could love , which , I am convinced , my eldest son has not . Am I right ? Do you agree with me , my dear ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir . \u201d It was gently , but it was calmly said , and Sir Thomas was easy on the score of the cousins . But the removal of his alarm did his niece no service : as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure increased ; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown , which Fanny could picture to herself , though she dared not lift up her eyes , he shortly afterwards , and in a voice of authority , said , \u201c Have you any reason , child , to think ill of Mr. Crawford \u2019s temper ? \u201d \u201c No , sir . \u201d She longed to add , \u201c But of his principles I have \u201d ; but her heart sunk under the appalling prospect of discussion , explanation , and probably non - conviction . Her ill opinion of him was founded chiefly on observations , which , for her cousins \u2019 sake , she could scarcely dare mention to their father . Maria and Julia , and especially Maria , were so closely implicated in Mr. Crawford \u2019s misconduct , that she could not give his character , such as she believed it , without betraying them . She had hoped that , to a man like her uncle , so discerning , so honourable , so good , the simple acknowledgment of settled _ dislike _ on her side would have been sufficient . To her infinite grief she found it was not . Sir Thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling wretchedness , and with a good deal of cold sternness , said , \u201c It is of no use , I perceive , to talk to you . We had better put an end to this most mortifying conference . Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting . I will , therefore , only add , as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct , that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed , and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed . For I _ had _ , Fanny , as I think my behaviour must have shewn , formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to England . I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper , self - conceit , and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days , even in young women , and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence . But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice . You have shewn yourself very , very different from anything that I had imagined . The advantage or disadvantage of your family , of your parents , your brothers and sisters , never seems to have had a moment \u2019s share in your thoughts on this occasion . How _ they _ might be benefited , how _ they _ must rejoice in such an establishment for you , is nothing to _ you _ . You think only of yourself , and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again . Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford \u2019s estate , or a tenth part of his merits . Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him . Maria is nobly married ; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia \u2019s hand , I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria \u2019s to Mr. Rushworth . \u201d After half a moment \u2019s pause : \u201c And I should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters , on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only _ half _ the eligibility of _ this _ , immediately and peremptorily , and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation , put a decided negative on it . I should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding . I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect . _ You _ are not to be judged by the same rule . You do not owe me the duty of a child . But , Fanny , if your heart can acquit you of _ ingratitude _ \u2014 \u201d He ceased . Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that , angry as he was , he would not press that article farther . Her heart was almost broke by such a picture of what she appeared to him ; by such accusations , so heavy , so multiplied , so rising in dreadful gradation ! Self - willed , obstinate , selfish , and ungrateful . He thought her all this . She had deceived his expectations ; she had lost his good opinion . What was to become of her ? \u201c I am very sorry , \u201d said she inarticulately , through her tears , \u201c I am very sorry indeed . \u201d \u201c Sorry ! yes , I hope you are sorry ; and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day \u2019s transactions . \u201d \u201c If it were possible for me to do otherwise \u201d said she , with another strong effort ; \u201c but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . \u201d Another burst of tears ; but in spite of that burst , and in spite of that great black word _ miserable _ , which served to introduce it , Sir Thomas began to think a little relenting , a little change of inclination , might have something to do with it ; and to augur favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself . He knew her to be very timid , and exceedingly nervous ; and thought it not improbable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time , a little pressing , a little patience , and a little impatience , a judicious mixture of all on the lover \u2019s side , might work their usual effect on . If the gentleman would but persevere , if he had but love enough to persevere , Sir Thomas began to have hopes ; and these reflections having passed across his mind and cheered it , \u201c Well , \u201d said he , in a tone of becoming gravity , but of less anger , \u201c well , child , dry up your tears . There is no use in these tears ; they can do no good . You must now come downstairs with me . Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already . You must give him your own answer : we can not expect him to be satisfied with less ; and you only can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments , which , unfortunately for himself , he certainly has imbibed . I am totally unequal to it . \u201d But Fanny shewed such reluctance , such misery , at the idea of going down to him , that Sir Thomas , after a little consideration , judged it better to indulge her . His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small depression in consequence ; but when he looked at his niece , and saw the state of feature and complexion which her crying had brought her into , he thought there might be as much lost as gained by an immediate interview . With a few words , therefore , of no particular meaning , he walked off by himself , leaving his poor niece to sit and cry over what had passed , with very wretched feelings . Her mind was all disorder . The past , present , future , everything was terrible . But her uncle \u2019s anger gave her the severest pain of all . Selfish and ungrateful ! to have appeared so to him ! She was miserable for ever . She had no one to take her part , to counsel , or speak for her . Her only friend was absent . He might have softened his father ; but all , perhaps all , would think her selfish and ungrateful . She might have to endure the reproach again and again ; she might hear it , or see it , or know it to exist for ever in every connexion about her . She could not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford ; yet , if he really loved her , and were unhappy too ! It was all wretchedness together . In about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned ; she was almost ready to faint at the sight of him . He spoke calmly , however , without austerity , without reproach , and she revived a little . There was comfort , too , in his words , as well as his manner , for he began with , \u201c Mr. Crawford is gone : he has just left me . I need not repeat what has passed . I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling , by an account of what he has felt . Suffice it , that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner , and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding , heart , and temper . Upon my representation of what you were suffering , he immediately , and with the greatest delicacy , ceased to urge to see you for the present . \u201d Here Fanny , who had looked up , looked down again . \u201c Of course , \u201d continued her uncle , \u201c it can not be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone , be it only for five minutes ; a request too natural , a claim too just to be denied . But there is no time fixed ; perhaps to - morrow , or whenever your spirits are composed enough . For the present you have only to tranquillise yourself . Check these tears ; they do but exhaust you . If , as I am willing to suppose , you wish to shew me any observance , you will not give way to these emotions , but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind . I advise you to go out : the air will do you good ; go out for an hour on the gravel ; you will have the shrubbery to yourself , and will be the better for air and exercise . And , Fanny \u201d ( turning back again for a moment ) , \u201c I shall make no mention below of what has passed ; I shall not even tell your aunt Bertram . There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment ; say nothing about it yourself . \u201d This was an order to be most joyfully obeyed ; this was an act of kindness which Fanny felt at her heart . To be spared from her aunt Norris \u2019s interminable reproaches ! he left her in a glow of gratitude . Anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches . Even to see Mr. Crawford would be less overpowering . She walked out directly , as her uncle recommended , and followed his advice throughout , as far as she could ; did check her tears ; did earnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind . She wished to prove to him that she did desire his comfort , and sought to regain his favour ; and he had given her another strong motive for exertion , in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts . Not to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth attaining ; and she felt equal to almost anything that might save her from her aunt Norris . She was struck , quite struck , when , on returning from her walk and going into the East room again , the first thing which caught her eye was a fire lighted and burning . A fire ! it seemed too much ; just at that time to be giving her such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude . She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of such a trifle again ; but she soon found , from the voluntary information of the housemaid , who came in to attend it , that so it was to be every day . Sir Thomas had given orders for it . \u201c I must be a brute , indeed , if I can be really ungrateful ! \u201d said she , in soliloquy . \u201c Heaven defend me from being ungrateful ! \u201d She saw nothing more of her uncle , nor of her aunt Norris , till they met at dinner . Her uncle \u2019s behaviour to her was then as nearly as possible what it had been before ; she was sure he did not mean there should be any change , and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy any ; but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her ; and when she found how much and how unpleasantly her having only walked out without her aunt \u2019s knowledge could be dwelt on , she felt all the reason she had to bless the kindness which saved her from the same spirit of reproach , exerted on a more momentous subject . \u201c If I had known you were going out , I should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny , \u201d said she , \u201c which I have since , to my very great inconvenience , been obliged to go and carry myself . I could very ill spare the time , and you might have saved me the trouble , if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out . It would have made no difference to you , I suppose , whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house . \u201d \u201c I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place , \u201d said Sir Thomas . \u201c Oh ! \u201d said Mrs. Norris , with a moment \u2019s check , \u201c that was very kind of you , Sir Thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house . Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there , I assure you , with the advantage of being of some use , and obliging her aunt : it is all her fault . If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a something about Fanny , I have often observed it before \u2014 she likes to go her own way to work ; she does not like to be dictated to ; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can ; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy , and independence , and nonsense , about her , which I would advise her to get the better of . \u201d As a general reflection on Fanny , Sir Thomas thought nothing could be more unjust , though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments himself , and he tried to turn the conversation : tried repeatedly before he could succeed ; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to perceive , either now , or at any other time , to what degree he thought well of his niece , or how very far he was from wishing to have his own children \u2019s merits set off by the depreciation of hers . She was talking _ at _ Fanny , and resenting this private walk half through the dinner . It was over , however , at last ; and the evening set in with more composure to Fanny , and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning ; but she trusted , in the first place , that she had done right : that her judgment had not misled her . For the purity of her intentions she could answer ; and she was willing to hope , secondly , that her uncle \u2019s displeasure was abating , and would abate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality , and felt , as a good man must feel , how wretched , and how unpardonable , how hopeless , and how wicked it was to marry without affection . When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past , she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally concluded , and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield , that everything would soon be as if no such subject had existed . She would not , could not believe , that Mr. Crawford \u2019s affection for her could distress him long ; his mind was not of that sort . London would soon bring its cure . In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation , and be thankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences . While Fanny \u2019s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes , her uncle was , soon after tea , called out of the room ; an occurrence too common to strike her , and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards , and advancing decidedly towards herself , said , \u201c Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma\u2019am , in his own room . \u201d Then it occurred to her what might be going on ; a suspicion rushed over her mind which drove the colour from her cheeks ; but instantly rising , she was preparing to obey , when Mrs. Norris called out , \u201c Stay , stay , Fanny ! what are you about ? where are you going ? do n\u2019t be in such a hurry . Depend upon it , it is not you who are wanted ; depend upon it , it is me \u201d ( looking at the butler ) ; \u201c but you are so very eager to put yourself forward . What should Sir Thomas want you for ? It is me , Baddeley , you mean ; I am coming this moment . You mean me , Baddeley , I am sure ; Sir Thomas wants me , not Miss Price . \u201d But Baddeley was stout . \u201c No , ma\u2019am , it is Miss Price ; I am certain of its being Miss Price . \u201d And there was a half - smile with the words , which meant , \u201c I do not think you would answer the purpose at all . \u201d Mrs. Norris , much discontented , was obliged to compose herself to work again ; and Fanny , walking off in agitating consciousness , found herself , as she anticipated , in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text":
