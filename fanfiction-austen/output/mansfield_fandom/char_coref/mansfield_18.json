{"document": "XVIII Everything was now in a regular train : theatre , actors , actresses , and dresses , were all getting forward ; but though no other great impediments arose , Fanny found , before many days were past , that it was not all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves , and that she had not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost too much for her at first . Everybody began to have their vexation . Edmund had many . Entirely against _ his _ judgment , a scene - painter arrived from town , and was at work , much to the increase of the expenses , and , what was worse , of the eclat of their proceedings ; and his brother , instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of the representation , was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way . Tom himself began to fret over the scene - painter \u2019s slow progress , and to feel the miseries of waiting . He had learned his part \u2014 all his parts , for he took every trifling one that could be united with the Butler , and began to be impatient to be acting ; and every day thus unemployed was tending to increase his sense of the insignificance of all his parts together , and make him more ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen . Fanny , being always a very courteous listener , and often the only listener at hand , came in for the complaints and the distresses of most of them . _ She _ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully ; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford ; that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible ; that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing ; that Edmund was behindhand with his part , and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth , who was wanting a prompter through every speech . She knew , also , that poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him : _ his _ complaint came before her as well as the rest ; and so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria \u2019s avoidance of him , and so needlessly often the rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford , that she had soon all the terror of other complaints from _ him _ . So far from being all satisfied and all enjoying , she found everybody requiring something they had not , and giving occasion of discontent to the others . Everybody had a part either too long or too short ; nobody would attend as they ought ; nobody would remember on which side they were to come in ; nobody but the complainer would observe any directions . Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them ; Henry Crawford acted well , and it was a pleasure to _ her _ to creep into the theatre , and attend the rehearsal of the first act , in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria . Maria , she also thought , acted well , too well ; and after the first rehearsal or two , Fanny began to be their only audience ; and sometimes as prompter , sometimes as spectator , was often very useful . As far as she could judge , Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all : he had more confidence than Edmund , more judgment than Tom , more talent and taste than Mr. Yates . She did not like him as a man , but she must admit him to be the best actor , and on this point there were not many who differed from her . Mr. Yates , indeed , exclaimed against his tameness and insipidity ; and the day came at last , when Mr. Rushworth turned to her with a black look , and said , \u201c Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this ? For the life and soul of me , I can not admire him ; and , between ourselves , to see such an undersized , little , mean - looking man , set up for a fine actor , is very ridiculous in my opinion . \u201d From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy , which Maria , from increasing hopes of Crawford , was at little pains to remove ; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s ever attaining to the knowledge of his two - and - forty speeches became much less . As to his ever making anything _ tolerable _ of them , nobody had the smallest idea of that except his mother ; _ she _ , indeed , regretted that his part was not more considerable , and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they were forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes ; but the others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword , and the first line of his speech , and being able to follow the prompter through the rest . Fanny , in her pity and kindheartedness , was at great pains to teach him how to learn , giving him all the helps and directions in her power , trying to make an artificial memory for him , and learning every word of his part herself , but without his being much the forwarder . Many uncomfortable , anxious , apprehensive feelings she certainly had ; but with all these , and other claims on her time and attention , she was as far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them , as without a companion in uneasiness ; quite as far from having no demand on her leisure as on her compassion . The gloom of her first anticipations was proved to have been unfounded . She was occasionally useful to all ; she was perhaps as much at peace as any . There was a great deal of needlework to be done , moreover , in which her help was wanted ; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well off as the rest , was evident by the manner in which she claimed it\u2014\u201cCome , Fanny , \u201d she cried , \u201c these are fine times for you , but you must not be always walking from one room to the other , and doing the lookings - on at your ease , in this way ; I want you here . I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand , to contrive Mr. Rushworth \u2019s cloak without sending for any more satin ; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together . There are but three seams ; you may do them in a trice . It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do . _ You _ are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than _ you _ , we should not get on very fast . \u201d Fanny took the work very quietly , without attempting any defence ; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf \u2014 \u201c One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _ should _ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too . What is the play about , Fanny ? you have never told me . \u201d \u201c Oh ! sister , pray do not ask her now ; for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time . It is about Lovers \u2019 Vows . \u201d \u201c I believe , \u201d said Fanny to her aunt Bertram , \u201c there will be three acts rehearsed to - morrow evening , and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once . \u201d \u201c You had better stay till the curtain is hung , \u201d interposed Mrs. Norris ; \u201c the curtain will be hung in a day or two \u2014 there is very little sense in a play without a curtain \u2014 and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons . \u201d Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting . Fanny did not share her aunt \u2019s composure : she thought of the morrow a great deal , for if the three acts were rehearsed , Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting together for the first time ; the third act would bring a scene between them which interested her most particularly , and which she was longing and dreading to see how they would perform . The whole subject of it was love \u2014 a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman , and very little short of a declaration of love be made by the lady . She had read and read the scene again with many painful , many wondering emotions , and looked forward to their representation of it as a circumstance almost too interesting . She did not _ believe _ they had yet rehearsed it , even in private . The morrow came , the plan for the evening continued , and Fanny \u2019s consideration of it did not become less agitated . She worked very diligently under her aunt \u2019s directions , but her diligence and her silence concealed a very absent , anxious mind ; and about noon she made her escape with her work to the East room , that she might have no concern in another , and , as she deemed it , most unnecessary rehearsal of the first act , which Henry Crawford was just proposing , desirous at once of having her time to herself , and of avoiding the sight of Mr. Rushworth . A glimpse , as she passed through the hall , of the two ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat , and she worked and meditated in the East room , undisturbed , for a quarter of an hour , when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford . \u201c Am I right ? Yes ; this is the East room . My dear Miss Price , I beg your pardon , but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help . \u201d Fanny , quite surprised , endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the room by her civilities , and looked at the bright bars of her empty grate with concern . \u201c Thank you ; I am quite warm , very warm . Allow me to stay here a little while , and do have the goodness to hear me my third act . I have brought my book , and if you would but rehearse it with me , I should be _ so _ obliged ! I came here to - day intending to rehearse it with Edmund \u2014 by ourselves \u2014 against the evening , but he is not in the way ; and if he _ were _ , I do not think I could go through it with _ him _ , till I have hardened myself a little ; for really there is a speech or two . You will be so good , wo n\u2019t you ? \u201d Fanny was most civil in her assurances , though she could not give them in a very steady voice . \u201c Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean ? \u201d continued Miss Crawford , opening her book . \u201c Here it is . I did not think much of it at first \u2014 but , upon my word . There , look at _ that _ speech , and _ that _ , and _ that _ . How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things ? Could you do it ? But then he is your cousin , which makes all the difference . You must rehearse it with me , that I may fancy _ you _ him , and get on by degrees . You _ have _ a look of _ his _ sometimes . \u201d \u201c Have I ? I will do my best with the greatest readiness ; but I must _ read _ the part , for I can say very little of it . \u201d \u201c _ None _ of it , I suppose . You are to have the book , of course . Now for it . We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage . There \u2014 very good school - room chairs , not made for a theatre , I dare say ; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson . What would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose ? Could Sir Thomas look in upon us just now , he would bless himself , for we are rehearsing all over the house . Yates is storming away in the dining - room . I heard him as I came upstairs , and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers , Agatha and Frederick . If _ they _ are not perfect , I _ shall _ be surprised . By the bye , I looked in upon them five minutes ago , and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying _ not _ to embrace , and Mr. Rushworth was with me . I thought he began to look a little queer , so I turned it off as well as I could , by whispering to him , \u2018 We shall have an excellent Agatha ; there is something so _ maternal _ in her manner , so completely _ maternal _ in her voice and countenance . \u2019 Was not that well done of me ? He brightened up directly . Now for my soliloquy . \u201d She began , and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire ; but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man . With such an Anhalt , however , Miss Crawford had courage enough ; and they had got through half the scene , when a tap at the door brought a pause , and the entrance of Edmund , the next moment , suspended it all . Surprise , consciousness , and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting ; and as Edmund was come on the very same business that had brought Miss Crawford , consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in _ them _ . He too had his book , and was seeking Fanny , to ask her to rehearse with him , and help him to prepare for the evening , without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house ; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together , of comparing schemes , and sympathising in praise of Fanny \u2019s kind offices . _ She _ could not equal them in their warmth . _ Her _ spirits sank under the glow of theirs , and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either . They must now rehearse together . Edmund proposed , urged , entreated it , till the lady , not very unwilling at first , could refuse no longer , and Fanny was wanted only to prompt and observe them . She was invested , indeed , with the office of judge and critic , and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults ; but from doing so every feeling within her shrank \u2014 she could not , would not , dared not attempt it : had she been otherwise qualified for criticism , her conscience must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation . She believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars . To prompt them must be enough for her ; and it was sometimes _ more _ than enough ; for she could not always pay attention to the book . In watching them she forgot herself ; and , agitated by the increasing spirit of Edmund \u2019s manner , had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help . It was imputed to very reasonable weariness , and she was thanked and pitied ; but she deserved their pity more than she hoped they would ever surmise . At last the scene was over , and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other ; and when again alone and able to recall the whole , she was inclined to believe their performance would , indeed , have such nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit , and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself . Whatever might be its effect , however , she must stand the brunt of it again that very day . The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly to take place in the evening : Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to return for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner ; and every one concerned was looking forward with eagerness . There seemed a general diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion . Tom was enjoying such an advance towards the end ; Edmund was in spirits from the morning \u2019s rehearsal , and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away . All were alert and impatient ; the ladies moved soon , the gentlemen soon followed them , and with the exception of Lady Bertram , Mrs. Norris , and Julia , everybody was in the theatre at an early hour ; and having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted , were waiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin . They did not wait long for the Crawfords , but there was no Mrs. Grant . She could not come . Dr. Grant , professing an indisposition , for which he had little credit with his fair sister - in - law , could not spare his wife . \u201c Dr. Grant is ill , \u201d said she , with mock solemnity . \u201c He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today . He fancied it tough , sent away his plate , and has been suffering ever since \u201d . Here was disappointment ! Mrs. Grant \u2019s non - attendance was sad indeed . Her pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her always valuable amongst them ; but _ now _ she was absolutely necessary . They could not act , they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her . The comfort of the whole evening was destroyed . What was to be done ? Tom , as Cottager , was in despair . After a pause of perplexity , some eyes began to be turned towards Fanny , and a voice or two to say , \u201c If Miss Price would be so good as to _ read _ the part . \u201d She was immediately surrounded by supplications ; everybody asked it ; even Edmund said , \u201c Do , Fanny , if it is not _ very _ disagreeable to you . \u201d But Fanny still hung back . She could not endure the idea of it . Why was not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well ? Or why had not she rather gone to her own room , as she had felt to be safest , instead of attending the rehearsal at all ? She had known it would irritate and distress her ; she had known it her duty to keep away . She was properly punished . \u201c You have only to _ read _ the part , \u201d said Henry Crawford , with renewed entreaty . \u201c And I do believe she can say every word of it , \u201d added Maria , \u201c for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places . Fanny , I am sure you know the part . \u201d Fanny could not say she did _ not _ ; and as they all persevered , as Edmund repeated his wish , and with a look of even fond dependence on her good - nature , she must yield . She would do her best . Everybody was satisfied ; and she was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart , while the others prepared to begin . They _ did _ begin ; and being too much engaged in their own noise to be struck by an unusual noise in the other part of the house , had proceeded some way when the door of the room was thrown open , and Julia , appearing at it , with a face all aghast , exclaimed , \u201c My father is come ! He is in the hall at this moment . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [31, 32], "text": "Fanny"}, {"position": [54, 55], "text": "she"}, {"position": [73, 74], "text": "her"},
