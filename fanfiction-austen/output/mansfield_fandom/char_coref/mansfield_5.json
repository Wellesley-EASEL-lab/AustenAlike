{"document": "V The young people were pleased with each other from the first . On each side there was much to attract , and their acquaintance soon promised as early an intimacy as good manners would warrant . Miss Crawford \u2019s beauty did her no disservice with the Miss Bertrams . They were too handsome themselves to dislike any woman for being so too , and were almost as much charmed as their brothers with her lively dark eye , clear brown complexion , and general prettiness . Had she been tall , full formed , and fair , it might have been more of a trial : but as it was , there could be no comparison ; and she was most allowably a sweet , pretty girl , while they were the finest young women in the country . Her brother was not handsome : no , when they first saw him he was absolutely plain , black and plain ; but still he was the gentleman , with a pleasing address . The second meeting proved him not so very plain : he was plain , to be sure , but then he had so much countenance , and his teeth were so good , and he was so well made , that one soon forgot he was plain ; and after a third interview , after dining in company with him at the Parsonage , he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody . He was , in fact , the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known , and they were equally delighted with him . Miss Bertram \u2019s engagement made him in equity the property of Julia , of which Julia was fully aware ; and before he had been at Mansfield a week , she was quite ready to be fallen in love with . Maria \u2019s notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct . She did not want to see or understand . \u201c There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man \u2014 everybody knew her situation \u2014 Mr. Crawford must take care of himself . \u201d Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger ! the Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing , and were ready to be pleased ; and he began with no object but of making them like him . He did not want them to die of love ; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him judge and feel better , he allowed himself great latitude on such points . \u201c I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , \u201d said he , as he returned from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit ; \u201c they are very elegant , agreeable girls . \u201d \u201c So they are indeed , and I am delighted to hear you say it . But you like Julia best . \u201d \u201c Oh yes ! I like Julia best . \u201d \u201c But do you really ? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the handsomest . \u201d \u201c So I should suppose . She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me . \u201d \u201c I shall not talk to you , Henry , but I know you _ will _ like her best at last . \u201d \u201c Do not I tell you that I like her best _ at _ _ first _ ? \u201d \u201c And besides , Miss Bertram is engaged . Remember that , my dear brother . Her choice is made . \u201d \u201c Yes , and I like her the better for it . An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged . She is satisfied with herself . Her cares are over , and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion . All is safe with a lady engaged : no harm can be done . \u201d \u201c Why , as to that , Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man , and it is a great match for her . \u201d \u201c But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him ; _ that _ is your opinion of your intimate friend . _ I _ do not subscribe to it . I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth . I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned . I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart . \u201d \u201c Mary , how shall we manage him ? \u201d \u201c We must leave him to himself , I believe . Talking does no good . He will be taken in at last . \u201d \u201c But I would not have him _ taken _ _ in _ ; I would not have him duped ; I would have it all fair and honourable . \u201d \u201c Oh dear ! let him stand his chance and be taken in . It will do just as well . Everybody is taken in at some period or other . \u201d \u201c Not always in marriage , dear Mary . \u201d \u201c In marriage especially . With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married , my dear Mrs. Grant , there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry . Look where I will , I see that it _ is _ so ; and I feel that it _ must _ be so , when I consider that it is , of all transactions , the one in which people expect most from others , and are least honest themselves . \u201d \u201c Ah ! You have been in a bad school for matrimony , in Hill Street . \u201d \u201c My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state ; but , however , speaking from my own observation , it is a manoeuvring business . I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion , or accomplishment , or good quality in the person , who have found themselves entirely deceived , and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse . What is this but a take in ? \u201d \u201c My dear child , there must be a little imagination here . I beg your pardon , but I can not quite believe you . Depend upon it , you see but half . You see the evil , but you do not see the consolation . There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere , and we are all apt to expect too much ; but then , if one scheme of happiness fails , human nature turns to another ; if the first calculation is wrong , we make a second better : we find comfort somewhere \u2014 and those evil - minded observers , dearest Mary , who make much of a little , are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves . \u201d \u201c Well done , sister ! I honour your _ esprit _ _ du _ _ corps _ . When I am a wife , I mean to be just as staunch myself ; and I wish my friends in general would be so too . It would save me many a heartache . \u201d \u201c You are as bad as your brother , Mary ; but we will cure you both . Mansfield shall cure you both , and without any taking in . Stay with us , and we will cure you . \u201d The Crawfords , without wanting to be cured , were very willing to stay . Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home , and Henry equally ready to lengthen his visit . He had come , intending to spend only a few days with them ; but Mansfield promised well , and there was nothing to call him elsewhere . It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her , and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so : a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent , stay - at - home man ; and Mr. Crawford \u2019s being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day . The Miss Bertrams \u2019 admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford \u2019s habits made her likely to feel . She acknowledged , however , that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men , that two such young men were not often seen together even in London , and that their manners , particularly those of the eldest , were very good . _ He _ had been much in London , and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund , and must , therefore , be preferred ; and , indeed , his being the eldest was another strong claim . She had felt an early presentiment that she _ should _ like the eldest best . She knew it was her way . Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant , indeed , at any rate ; he was the sort of young man to be generally liked , his agreeableness was of the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp , for he had easy manners , excellent spirits , a large acquaintance , and a great deal to say ; and the reversion of Mansfield Park , and a baronetcy , did no harm to all this . Miss Crawford soon felt that he and his situation might do . She looked about her with due consideration , and found almost everything in his favour : a park , a real park , five miles round , a spacious modern - built house , so well placed and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen \u2019s seats in the kingdom , and wanting only to be completely new furnished \u2014 pleasant sisters , a quiet mother , and an agreeable man himself \u2014 with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his father , and of being Sir Thomas hereafter . It might do very well ; she believed she should accept him ; and she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B \u2014 \u2014 races . These races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance began ; and as it appeared that the family did not , from his usual goings on , expect him back again for many weeks , it would bring his passion to an early proof . Much was said on his side to induce her to attend the races , and schemes were made for a large party to them , with all the eagerness of inclination , but it would only do to be talked of . And Fanny , what was _ she _ doing and thinking all this while ? and what was _ her _ opinion of the newcomers ? Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny . In a quiet way , very little attended to , she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss Crawford \u2019s beauty ; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very plain , in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary , she never mentioned _ him _ . The notice , which she excited herself , was to this effect . \u201c I begin now to understand you all , except Miss Price , \u201d said Miss Crawford , as she was walking with the Mr. Bertrams . \u201c Pray , is she out , or is she not ? I am puzzled . She dined at the Parsonage , with the rest of you , which seemed like being _ out _ ; and yet she says so little , that I can hardly suppose she _ is _ . \u201d Edmund , to whom this was chiefly addressed , replied , \u201c I believe I know what you mean , but I will not undertake to answer the question . My cousin is grown up . She has the age and sense of a woman , but the outs and not outs are beyond me . \u201d \u201c And yet , in general , nothing can be more easily ascertained . The distinction is so broad . Manners as well as appearance are , generally speaking , so totally different . Till now , I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl \u2019s being out or not . A girl not out has always the same sort of dress : a close bonnet , for instance ; looks very demure , and never says a word . You may smile , but it is so , I assure you ; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far , it is all very proper . Girls should be quiet and modest . The most objectionable part is , that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden . They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite \u2014 to confidence ! _ That _ is the faulty part of the present system . One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing \u2014 and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before . Mr. Bertram , I dare say _ you _ have sometimes met with such changes . \u201d \u201c I believe I have , but this is hardly fair ; I see what you are at . You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson . \u201d \u201c No , indeed . Miss Anderson ! I do not know who or what you mean . I am quite in the dark . But I _ will _ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about . \u201d \u201c Ah ! you carry it off very well , but I can not be quite so far imposed on . You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye , in describing an altered young lady . You paint too accurately for mistake . It was exactly so . The Andersons of Baker Street . We were speaking of them the other day , you know . Edmund , you have heard me mention Charles Anderson . The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it . When Anderson first introduced me to his family , about two years ago , his sister was not _ out _ , and I could not get her to speak to me . I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson , with only her and a little girl or two in the room , the governess being sick or run away , and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business , and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady \u2014 nothing like a civil answer \u2014 she screwed up her mouth , and turned from me with such an air ! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth . She was then _ out _ . I met her at Mrs. Holford \u2019s , and did not recollect her . She came up to me , claimed me as an acquaintance , stared me out of countenance ; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look . I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time , and Miss Crawford , it is plain , has heard the story . \u201d \u201c And a very pretty story it is , and with more truth in it , I dare say , than does credit to Miss Anderson . It is too common a fault . Mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters . I do not know where the error lies . I do not pretend to set people right , but I do see that they are often wrong . \u201d \u201c Those who are showing the world what female manners _ should _ be , \u201d said Mr. Bertram gallantly , \u201c are doing a great deal to set them right . \u201d \u201c The error is plain enough , \u201d said the less courteous Edmund ; \u201c such girls are ill brought up . They are given wrong notions from the beginning . They are always acting upon motives of vanity , and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour _ before _ they appear in public than afterwards . \u201d \u201c I do not know , \u201d replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly . \u201c Yes , I can not agree with you there . It is certainly the modestest part of the business . It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were , which I have seen done . That is worse than anything \u2014 quite disgusting ! \u201d \u201c Yes , _ that _ is very inconvenient indeed , \u201d said Mr. Bertram . \u201c It leads one astray ; one does not know what to do . The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well ( and nothing was ever juster ) , tell one what is expected ; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them . I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September , just after my return from the West Indies . My friend Sneyd \u2014 you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund \u2014 his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me . When we reached Albion Place they were out ; we went after them , and found them on the pier : Mrs. and the two Miss Sneyds , with others of their acquaintance . I made my bow in form ; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men , attached myself to one of her daughters , walked by her side all the way home , and made myself as agreeable as I could ; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners , and as ready to talk as to listen . I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong . They looked just the same : both well - dressed , with veils and parasols like other girls ; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not _ out _ , and had most excessively offended the eldest . Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months ; and Miss Sneyd , I believe , has never forgiven me . \u201d \u201c That was bad indeed . Poor Miss Sneyd . Though I have no younger sister , I feel for her . To be neglected before one \u2019s time must be very vexatious ; but it was entirely the mother \u2019s fault . Miss Augusta should have been with her governess . Such half - and - half doings never prosper . But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price . Does she go to balls ? Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister \u2019s ? \u201d \u201c No , \u201d replied Edmund ; \u201c I do not think she has ever been to a ball . My mother seldom goes into company herself , and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant , and Fanny stays at home with _ her _ . \u201d \u201c Oh ! then the point is clear . Miss Price is not out . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 4], "text": "The young people"}, {"position": [46, 49], "text": "the Miss Bertrams"}, {"position": [50, 51], "text":
