{"document": "XIII The Honourable John Yates , this new friend , had not much to recommend him beyond habits of fashion and expense , and being the younger son of a lord with a tolerable independence ; and Sir Thomas would probably have thought his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable . Mr. Bertram \u2019s acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth , where they had spent ten days together in the same society , and the friendship , if friendship it might be called , had been proved and perfected by Mr. Yates \u2019s being invited to take Mansfield in his way , whenever he could , and by his promising to come ; and he did come rather earlier than had been expected , in consequence of the sudden breaking - up of a large party assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend , which he had left Weymouth to join . He came on the wings of disappointment , and with his head full of acting , for it had been a theatrical party ; and the play in which he had borne a part was within two days of representation , when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the family had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers . To be so near happiness , so near fame , so near the long paragraph in praise of the private theatricals at Ecclesford , the seat of the Right Hon . Lord Ravenshaw , in Cornwall , which would of course have immortalised the whole party for at least a twelvemonth ! and being so near , to lose it all , was an injury to be keenly felt , and Mr. Yates could talk of nothing else . Ecclesford and its theatre , with its arrangements and dresses , rehearsals and jokes , was his never - failing subject , and to boast of the past his only consolation . Happily for him , a love of the theatre is so general , an itch for acting so strong among young people , that he could hardly out - talk the interest of his hearers . From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue it was all bewitching , and there were few who did not wish to have been a party concerned , or would have hesitated to try their skill . The play had been Lovers \u2019 Vows , and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel . \u201c A trifling part , \u201d said he , \u201c and not at all to my taste , and such a one as I certainly would not accept again ; but I was determined to make no difficulties . Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford ; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me , it was impossible to take it , you know . I was sorry for _ him _ that he should have so mistaken his powers , for he was no more equal to the Baron \u2014 a little man with a weak voice , always hoarse after the first ten minutes . It must have injured the piece materially ; but _ I _ was resolved to make no difficulties . Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick , but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself ; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two . I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick . Luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him . Our Agatha was inimitable , and the duke was thought very great by many . And upon the whole , it would certainly have gone off wonderfully . \u201d \u201c It was a hard case , upon my word \u201d ; and , \u201c I do think you were very much to be pitied , \u201d were the kind responses of listening sympathy . \u201c It is not worth complaining about ; but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time ; and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted . It was but three days ; and being only a grandmother , and all happening two hundred miles off , I think there would have been no great harm , and it was suggested , I know ; but Lord Ravenshaw , who I suppose is one of the most correct men in England , would not hear of it . \u201d \u201c An afterpiece instead of a comedy , \u201d said Mr. Bertram . \u201c Lovers \u2019 Vows were at an end , and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by themselves . Well , the jointure may comfort _ him _ ; and perhaps , between friends , he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron , and was not sorry to withdraw ; and to make _ you _ amends , Yates , I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield , and ask you to be our manager . \u201d This , though the thought of the moment , did not end with the moment ; for the inclination to act was awakened , and in no one more strongly than in him who was now master of the house ; and who , having so much leisure as to make almost any novelty a certain good , had likewise such a degree of lively talents and comic taste , as were exactly adapted to the novelty of acting . The thought returned again and again . \u201c Oh for the Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with . \u201d Each sister could echo the wish ; and Henry Crawford , to whom , in all the riot of his gratifications it was yet an untasted pleasure , was quite alive at the idea . \u201c I really believe , \u201d said he , \u201c I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written , from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat . I feel as if I could be anything or everything ; as if I could rant and storm , or sigh or cut capers , in any tragedy or comedy in the English language . Let us be doing something . Be it only half a play , an act , a scene ; what should prevent us ? Not these countenances , I am sure , \u201d looking towards the Miss Bertrams ; \u201c and for a theatre , what signifies a theatre ? We shall be only amusing ourselves . Any room in this house might suffice . \u201d \u201c We must have a curtain , \u201d said Tom Bertram ; \u201c a few yards of green baize for a curtain , and perhaps that may be enough . \u201d \u201c Oh , quite enough , \u201d cried Mr. Yates , \u201c with only just a side wing or two run up , doors in flat , and three or four scenes to be let down ; nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this . For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more . \u201d \u201c I believe we must be satisfied with _ less _ , \u201d said Maria . \u201c There would not be time , and other difficulties would arise . We must rather adopt Mr. Crawford \u2019s views , and make the _ performance _ , not the _ theatre _ , our object . Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery . \u201d \u201c Nay , \u201d said Edmund , who began to listen with alarm . \u201c Let us do nothing by halves . If we are to act , let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit , boxes , and gallery , and let us have a play entire from beginning to end ; so as it be a German play , no matter what , with a good tricking , shifting afterpiece , and a figure - dance , and a hornpipe , and a song between the acts . If we do not outdo Ecclesford , we do nothing . \u201d \u201c Now , Edmund , do not be disagreeable , \u201d said Julia . \u201c Nobody loves a play better than you do , or can have gone much farther to see one . \u201d \u201c True , to see real acting , good hardened real acting ; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade : a set of gentlemen and ladies , who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through . \u201d After a short pause , however , the subject still continued , and was discussed with unabated eagerness , every one \u2019s inclination increasing by the discussion , and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest ; and though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy , and his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy , and that nothing in the world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all , the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable . He was determined to prevent it , if possible , though his mother , who equally heard the conversation which passed at table , did not evince the least disapprobation . The same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying his strength . Maria , Julia , Henry Crawford , and Mr. Yates were in the billiard - room . Tom , returning from them into the drawing - room , where Edmund was standing thoughtfully by the fire , while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little distance , and Fanny close beside her arranging her work , thus began as he entered\u2014\u201cSuch a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground . I can stand it no longer , and I think , I may say , that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again ; but one good thing I have just ascertained : it is the very room for a theatre , precisely the shape and length for it ; and the doors at the farther end , communicating with each other , as they may be made to do in five minutes , by merely moving the bookcase in my father \u2019s room , is the very thing we could have desired , if we had sat down to wish for it ; and my father \u2019s room will be an excellent greenroom . It seems to join the billiard - room on purpose . \u201d \u201c You are not serious , Tom , in meaning to act ? \u201d said Edmund , in a low voice , as his brother approached the fire . \u201c Not serious ! never more so , I assure you . What is there to surprise you in it ? \u201d \u201c I think it would be very wrong . In a _ general _ light , private theatricals are open to some objections , but as _ we _ are circumstanced , I must think it would be highly injudicious , and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind . It would shew great want of feeling on my father \u2019s account , absent as he is , and in some degree of constant danger ; and it would be imprudent , I think , with regard to Maria , whose situation is a very delicate one , considering everything , extremely delicate . \u201d \u201c You take up a thing so seriously ! as if we were going to act three times a week till my father \u2019s return , and invite all the country . But it is not to be a display of that sort . We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves , just to vary the scene , and exercise our powers in something new . We want no audience , no publicity . We may be trusted , I think , in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable ; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own . I have no fears and no scruples . And as to my father \u2019s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he . It is a _ very _ anxious period for her . \u201d As he said this , each looked towards their mother . Lady Bertram , sunk back in one corner of the sofa , the picture of health , wealth , ease , and tranquillity , was just falling into a gentle doze , while Fanny was getting through the few difficulties of her work for her . Edmund smiled and shook his head . \u201c By Jove ! this wo n\u2019t do , \u201d cried Tom , throwing himself into a chair with a hearty laugh . \u201c To be sure , my dear mother , your anxiety \u2014 I was unlucky there . \u201d \u201c What is the matter ? \u201d asked her ladyship , in the heavy tone of one half - roused ; \u201c I was not asleep . \u201d \u201c Oh dear , no , ma\u2019am , nobody suspected you ! Well , Edmund , \u201d he continued , returning to the former subject , posture , and voice , as soon as Lady Bertram began to nod again , \u201c but _ this _ I _ will _ maintain , that we shall be doing no harm . \u201d \u201c I can not agree with you ; I am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it . \u201d \u201c And I am convinced to the contrary . Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people , or promotes it more , than my father , and for anything of the acting , spouting , reciting kind , I think he has always a decided taste . I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys . How many a time have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar , and to _ be\u2019d _ and not _ to _ _ be\u2019d _ , in this very room , for his amusement ? And I am sure , _ my _ _ name _ _ was _ _ Norval _ , every evening of my life through one Christmas holidays . \u201d \u201c It was a very different thing . You must see the difference yourself . My father wished us , as schoolboys , to speak well , but he would never wish his grown - up daughters to be acting plays . His sense of decorum is strict . \u201d \u201c I know all that , \u201d said Tom , displeased . \u201c I know my father as well as you do ; and I \u2019ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him . Manage your own concerns , Edmund , and I \u2019ll take care of the rest of the family . \u201d \u201c If you are resolved on acting , \u201d replied the persevering Edmund , \u201c I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way ; and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted . It would be taking liberties with my father \u2019s house in his absence which could not be justified . \u201d \u201c For everything of that nature I will be answerable , \u201d said Tom , in a decided tone . \u201c His house shall not be hurt . I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister \u2019s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other . Absolute nonsense ! \u201d \u201c The innovation , if not wrong as an innovation , will be wrong as an expense . \u201d \u201c Yes , the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious ! Perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds . Something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly , but it will be on the simplest plan : a green curtain and a little carpenter \u2019s work , and that \u2019s all ; and as the carpenter \u2019s work may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself , it will be too absurd to talk of expense ; and as long as Jackson is employed , everything will be right with Sir Thomas . Do n\u2019t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself . Do n\u2019t act yourself , if you do not like it , but do n\u2019t expect to govern everybody else . \u201d \u201c No , as to acting myself , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c _ that _ I absolutely protest against . \u201d Tom walked out of the room as he said it , and Edmund was left to sit down and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation . Fanny , who had heard it all , and borne Edmund company in every feeling throughout the whole , now ventured to say , in her anxiety to suggest some comfort , \u201c Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them . Your brother \u2019s taste and your sisters \u2019 seem very different . \u201d \u201c I have no hope there , Fanny . If they persist in the scheme , they will find something . I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _ them _ , and that is all I can do . \u201d \u201c I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side . \u201d \u201c I dare say she would , but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use ; and if I can not convince them myself , I shall let things take their course , without attempting it through her . Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all , and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears . \u201d His sisters , to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning , were quite as impatient of his advice , quite as unyielding to his representation , quite as determined in the cause of pleasure , as Tom . Their mother had no objection to the plan , and they were not in the least afraid of their father \u2019s disapprobation . There could be no harm in what had been done in so many respectable families , and by so many women of the first consideration ; and it must be scrupulousness run mad that could see anything to censure in a plan like theirs , comprehending only brothers and sisters and intimate friends , and which would never be heard of beyond themselves . Julia _ did _ seem inclined to admit that Maria \u2019s situation might require particular caution and delicacy \u2014 but that could not extend to _ her_\u2014she was at liberty ; and Maria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint , and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either father or mother . Edmund had little to hope , but he was still urging the subject when Henry Crawford entered the room , fresh from the Parsonage , calling out , \u201c No want of hands in our theatre , Miss Bertram . No want of understrappers : my sister desires her love , and hopes to be admitted into the company , and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante , that you may not like to do yourselves . \u201d Maria gave Edmund a glance , which meant , \u201c What say you now ? Can we be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same ? \u201d And Edmund , silenced , was obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry fascination to the mind of genius ; and with the ingenuity of love , to dwell more on the obliging , accommodating purport of the message than on anything else . The scheme advanced . Opposition was vain ; and as to Mrs. Norris , he was mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any . She started no difficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest nephew and niece , who were all - powerful with her ; and as the whole arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody , and none at all to herself , as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry , bustle , and importance , and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself obliged to leave her own house , where she had been living a month at her own cost , and take up her abode in theirs , that every hour might be spent in their service , she was , in fact , exceedingly delighted with the project .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 5], "text": "The Honourable John Yates"}, {"position": [15, 16], "text": "him"}, {"position": [37, 39], "text": "Sir Thomas"}, {"position": [43,
