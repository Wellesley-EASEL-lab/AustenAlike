{"document": "XXIV Henry Crawford had quite made up his mind by the next morning to give another fortnight to Mansfield , and having sent for his hunters , and written a few lines of explanation to the Admiral , he looked round at his sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him , and seeing the coast clear of the rest of the family , said , with a smile , \u201c And how do you think I mean to amuse myself , Mary , on the days that I do not hunt ? I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week ; but I have a plan for the intermediate days , and what do you think it is ? \u201d \u201c To walk and ride with me , to be sure . \u201d \u201c Not exactly , though I shall be happy to do both , but _ that _ would be exercise only to my body , and I must take care of my mind . Besides , _ that _ would be all recreation and indulgence , without the wholesome alloy of labour , and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness . No , my plan is to make Fanny Price in love with me . \u201d \u201c Fanny Price ! Nonsense ! No , no . You ought to be satisfied with her two cousins . \u201d \u201c But I can not be satisfied without Fanny Price , without making a small hole in Fanny Price \u2019s heart . You do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice . When we talked of her last night , you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks . You see her every day , and therefore do not notice it ; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn . She was then merely a quiet , modest , not plain - looking girl , but she is now absolutely pretty . I used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance ; but in that soft skin of hers , so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday , there is decided beauty ; and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth , I do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express . And then , her air , her manner , her _ tout _ _ ensemble _ , is so indescribably improved ! She must be grown two inches , at least , since October . \u201d \u201c Phoo ! phoo ! This is only because there were no tall women to compare her with , and because she has got a new gown , and you never saw her so well dressed before . She is just what she was in October , believe me . The truth is , that she was the only girl in company for you to notice , and you must have a somebody . I have always thought her pretty \u2014 not strikingly pretty \u2014 but \u2018 pretty enough , \u2019 as people say ; a sort of beauty that grows on one . Her eyes should be darker , but she has a sweet smile ; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement , I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress , and your having nobody else to look at ; and therefore , if you do set about a flirtation with her , you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty , or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly . \u201d Her brother gave only a smile to this accusation , and soon afterwards said , \u201c I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny . I do not understand her . I could not tell what she would be at yesterday . What is her character ? Is she solemn ? Is she queer ? Is she prudish ? Why did she draw back and look so grave at me ? I could hardly get her to speak . I never was so long in company with a girl in my life , trying to entertain her , and succeed so ill ! Never met with a girl who looked so grave on me ! I must try to get the better of this . Her looks say , \u2018 I will not like you , I am determined not to like you \u2019 ; and I say she shall . \u201d \u201c Foolish fellow ! And so this is her attraction after all ! This it is , her not caring about you , which gives her such a soft skin , and makes her so much taller , and produces all these charms and graces ! I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy ; a _ little _ love , perhaps , may animate and do her good , but I will not have you plunge her deep , for she is as good a little creature as ever lived , and has a great deal of feeling . \u201d \u201c It can be but for a fortnight , \u201d said Henry ; \u201c and if a fortnight can kill her , she must have a constitution which nothing could save . No , I will not do her any harm , dear little soul ! I only want her to look kindly on me , to give me smiles as well as blushes , to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are , and be all animation when I take it and talk to her ; to think as I think , be interested in all my possessions and pleasures , try to keep me longer at Mansfield , and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again . I want nothing more . \u201d \u201c Moderation itself ! \u201d said Mary . \u201c I can have no scruples now . Well , you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself , for we are a great deal together . \u201d And without attempting any farther remonstrance , she left Fanny to her fate , a fate which , had not Fanny \u2019s heart been guarded in a way unsuspected by Miss Crawford , might have been a little harder than she deserved ; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young ladies of eighteen ( or one should not read about them ) as are never to be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent , manner , attention , and flattery can do , I have no inclination to believe Fanny one of them , or to think that with so much tenderness of disposition , and so much taste as belonged to her , she could have escaped heart - whole from the courtship ( though the courtship only of a fortnight ) of such a man as Crawford , in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him to be overcome , had not her affection been engaged elsewhere . With all the security which love of another and disesteem of him could give to the peace of mind he was attacking , his continued attentions \u2014 continued , but not obtrusive , and adapting themselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of her character \u2014 obliged her very soon to dislike him less than formerly . She had by no means forgotten the past , and she thought as ill of him as ever ; but she felt his powers : he was entertaining ; and his manners were so improved , so polite , so seriously and blamelessly polite , that it was impossible not to be civil to him in return . A very few days were enough to effect this ; and at the end of those few days , circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his views of pleasing her , inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness which must dispose her to be pleased with everybody . William , her brother , the so long absent and dearly loved brother , was in England again . She had a letter from him herself , a few hurried happy lines , written as the ship came up Channel , and sent into Portsmouth with the first boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead ; and when Crawford walked up with the newspaper in his hand , which he had hoped would bring the first tidings , he found her trembling with joy over this letter , and listening with a glowing , grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply . It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughly master of the subject , or had in fact become at all aware of her having such a brother , or his being in such a ship , but the interest then excited had been very properly lively , determining him on his return to town to apply for information as to the probable period of the Antwerp \u2019s return from the Mediterranean , etc . ; and the good luck which attended his early examination of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of his ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her , as well as of his dutiful attention to the Admiral , in having for many years taken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence . He proved , however , to be too late . All those fine first feelings , of which he had hoped to be the exciter , were already given . But his intention , the kindness of his intention , was thankfully acknowledged : quite thankfully and warmly , for she was elevated beyond the common timidity of her mind by the flow of her love for William . This dear William would soon be amongst them . There could be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately , for he was still only a midshipman ; and as his parents , from living on the spot , must already have seen him , and be seeing him perhaps daily , his direct holidays might with justice be instantly given to the sister , who had been his best correspondent through a period of seven years , and the uncle who had done most for his support and advancement ; and accordingly the reply to her reply , fixing a very early day for his arrival , came as soon as possible ; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in the agitation of her first dinner - visit , when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature , watching in the hall , in the lobby , on the stairs , for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her a brother . It came happily while she was thus waiting ; and there being neither ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting , she was with him as he entered the house , and the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no interruption and no witnesses , unless the servants chiefly intent upon opening the proper doors could be called such . This was exactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at , as each proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised Mrs. Norris \u2019s continuing where she was , instead of rushing out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them . William and Fanny soon shewed themselves ; and Sir Thomas had the pleasure of receiving , in his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , certainly a very different person from the one he had equipped seven years ago , but a young man of an open , pleasant countenance , and frank , unstudied , but feeling and respectful manners , and such as confirmed him his friend . It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of such an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation , and the first of fruition ; it was some time even before her happiness could be said to make her happy , before the disappointment inseparable from the alteration of person had vanished , and she could see in him the same William as before , and talk to him , as her heart had been yearning to do through many a past year . That time , however , did gradually come , forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her own , and much less encumbered by refinement or self - distrust . She was the first object of his love , but it was a love which his stronger spirits , and bolder temper , made it as natural for him to express as to feel . On the morrow they were walking about together with true enjoyment , and every succeeding morrow renewed a _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ which Sir Thomas could not but observe with complacency , even before Edmund had pointed it out to him . Excepting the moments of peculiar delight , which any marked or unlooked - for instance of Edmund \u2019s consideration of her in the last few months had excited , Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life , as in this unchecked , equal , fearless intercourse with the brother and friend who was opening all his heart to her , telling her all his hopes and fears , plans , and solicitudes respecting that long thought of , dearly earned , and justly valued blessing of promotion ; who could give her direct and minute information of the father and mother , brothers and sisters , of whom she very seldom heard ; who was interested in all the comforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield ; ready to think of every member of that home as she directed , or differing only by a less scrupulous opinion , and more noisy abuse of their aunt Norris , and with whom ( perhaps the dearest indulgence of the whole ) all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over again , and every former united pain and pleasure retraced with the fondest recollection . An advantage this , a strengthener of love , in which even the conjugal tie is beneath the fraternal . Children of the same family , the same blood , with the same first associations and habits , have some means of enjoyment in their power , which no subsequent connexions can supply ; and it must be by a long and unnatural estrangement , by a divorce which no subsequent connexion can justify , if such precious remains of the earliest attachments are ever entirely outlived . Too often , alas ! it is so . Fraternal love , sometimes almost everything , is at others worse than nothing . But with William and Fanny Price it was still a sentiment in all its prime and freshness , wounded by no opposition of interest , cooled by no separate attachment , and feeling the influence of time and absence only in its increase . An affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who had hearts to value anything good . Henry Crawford was as much struck with it as any . He honoured the warm - hearted , blunt fondness of the young sailor , which led him to say , with his hands stretched towards Fanny \u2019s head , \u201c Do you know , I begin to like that queer fashion already , though when I first heard of such things being done in England , I could not believe it ; and when Mrs. Brown , and the other women at the Commissioner \u2019s at Gibraltar , appeared in the same trim , I thought they were mad ; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything \u201d ; and saw , with lively admiration , the glow of Fanny \u2019s cheek , the brightness of her eye , the deep interest , the absorbed attention , while her brother was describing any of the imminent hazards , or terrific scenes , which such a period at sea must supply . It was a picture which Henry Crawford had moral taste enough to value . Fanny \u2019s attractions increased \u2014 increased twofold ; for the sensibility which beautified her complexion and illumined her countenance was an attraction in itself . He was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of her heart . She had feeling , genuine feeling . It would be something to be loved by such a girl , to excite the first ardours of her young unsophisticated mind ! She interested him more than he had foreseen . A fortnight was not enough . His stay became indefinite . William was often called on by his uncle to be the talker . His recitals were amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas , but the chief object in seeking them was to understand the reciter , to know the young man by his histories ; and he listened to his clear , simple , spirited details with full satisfaction , seeing in them the proof of good principles , professional knowledge , energy , courage , and cheerfulness , everything that could deserve or promise well . Young as he was , William had already seen a great deal . He had been in the Mediterranean ; in the West Indies ; in the Mediterranean again ; had been often taken on shore by the favour of his captain , and in the course of seven years had known every variety of danger which sea and war together could offer . With such means in his power he had a right to be listened to ; and though Mrs. Norris could fidget about the room , and disturb everybody in quest of two needlefuls of thread or a second - hand shirt button , in the midst of her nephew \u2019s account of a shipwreck or an engagement , everybody else was attentive ; and even Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved , or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say , \u201c Dear me ! how disagreeable ! I wonder anybody can ever go to sea . \u201d To Henry Crawford they gave a different feeling . He longed to have been at sea , and seen and done and suffered as much . His heart was warmed , his fancy fired , and he felt the highest respect for a lad who , before he was twenty , had gone through such bodily hardships and given such proofs of mind . The glory of heroism , of usefulness , of exertion , of endurance , made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful contrast ; and he wished he had been a William Price , distinguishing himself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much self - respect and happy ardour , instead of what he was ! The wish was rather eager than lasting . He was roused from the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it , by some inquiry from Edmund as to his plans for the next day \u2019s hunting ; and he found it was as well to be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command . In one respect it was better , as it gave him the means of conferring a kindness where he wished to oblige . With spirits , courage , and curiosity up to anything , William expressed an inclination to hunt ; and Crawford could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself , and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas , who knew better than his nephew the value of such a loan , and some alarms to reason away in Fanny . She feared for William ; by no means convinced by all that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries , of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged , the rough horses and mules he had ridden , or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls , that he was at all equal to the management of a high - fed hunter in an English fox - chase ; nor till he returned safe and well , without accident or discredit , could she be reconciled to the risk , or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he had fully intended it should produce . When it was proved , however , to have done William no harm , she could allow it to be a kindness , and even reward the owner with a smile when the animal was one minute tendered to his use again ; and the next , with the greatest cordiality , and in a manner not to be resisted , made over to his use entirely so long as he remained in Northamptonshire .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position":
