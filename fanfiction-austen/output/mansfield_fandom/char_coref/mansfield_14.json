{"document": "XIV Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed . The business of finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle ; and the carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements , had suggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties , and having made the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident , was already at work , while a play was still to seek . Other preparations were also in hand . An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from Northampton , and been cut out by Mrs. Norris ( with a saving by her good management of full three - quarters of a yard ) , and was actually forming into a curtain by the housemaids , and still the play was wanting ; and as two or three days passed away in this manner , Edmund began almost to hope that none might ever be found . There were , in fact , so many things to be attended to , so many people to be pleased , so many best characters required , and , above all , such a need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy , that there did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and zeal could hold out . On the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams , Henry Crawford , and Mr. Yates ; on the comic , Tom Bertram , not _ quite _ alone , because it was evident that Mary Crawford \u2019s wishes , though politely kept back , inclined the same way : but his determinateness and his power seemed to make allies unnecessary ; and , independent of this great irreconcilable difference , they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the whole , but every character first - rate , and three principal women . All the best plays were run over in vain . Neither Hamlet , nor Macbeth , nor Othello , nor Douglas , nor The Gamester , presented anything that could satisfy even the tragedians ; and The Rivals , The School for Scandal , Wheel of Fortune , Heir at Law , and a long et cetera , were successively dismissed with yet warmer objections . No piece could be proposed that did not supply somebody with a difficulty , and on one side or the other it was a continual repetition of , \u201c Oh no , _ that _ will never do ! Let us have no ranting tragedies . Too many characters . Not a tolerable woman \u2019s part in the play . Anything but _ that _ , my dear Tom . It would be impossible to fill it up . One could not expect anybody to take such a part . Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end . _ That _ might do , perhaps , but for the low parts . If I _ must _ give my opinion , I have always thought it the most insipid play in the English language . _ I _ do not wish to make objections ; I shall be happy to be of any use , but I think we could not chuse worse . \u201d Fanny looked on and listened , not unamused to observe the selfishness which , more or less disguised , seemed to govern them all , and wondering how it would end . For her own gratification she could have wished that something might be acted , for she had never seen even half a play , but everything of higher consequence was against it . \u201c This will never do , \u201d said Tom Bertram at last . \u201c We are wasting time most abominably . Something must be fixed on . No matter what , so that something is chosen . We must not be so nice . A few characters too many must not frighten us . We must _ double _ them . We must descend a little . If a part is insignificant , the greater our credit in making anything of it . From this moment I make no difficulties . I take any part you chuse to give me , so as it be comic . Let it but be comic , I condition for nothing more . \u201d For about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law , doubting only whether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself ; and very earnestly , but very unsuccessfully , trying to persuade the others that there were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the Dramatis Person\u00e6 . The pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same speaker , who , taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the table , and turning it over , suddenly exclaimed\u2014\u201cLovers \u2019 Vows ! And why should not Lovers \u2019 Vows do for _ us _ as well as for the Ravenshaws ? How came it never to be thought of before ? It strikes me as if it would do exactly . What say you all ? Here are two capital tragic parts for Yates and Crawford , and here is the rhyming Butler for me , if nobody else wants it ; a trifling part , but the sort of thing I should not dislike , and , as I said before , I am determined to take anything and do my best . And as for the rest , they may be filled up by anybody . It is only Count Cassel and Anhalt . \u201d The suggestion was generally welcome . Everybody was growing weary of indecision , and the first idea with everybody was , that nothing had been proposed before so likely to suit them all . Mr. Yates was particularly pleased : he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford , had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw \u2019s , and been forced to re - rant it all in his own room . The storm through Baron Wildenheim was the height of his theatrical ambition ; and with the advantage of knowing half the scenes by heart already , he did now , with the greatest alacrity , offer his services for the part . To do him justice , however , he did not resolve to appropriate it ; for remembering that there was some very good ranting - ground in Frederick , he professed an equal willingness for that . Henry Crawford was ready to take either . Whichever Mr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him , and a short parley of compliment ensued . Miss Bertram , feeling all the interest of an Agatha in the question , took on her to decide it , by observing to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which height and figure ought to be considered , and that _ his _ being the tallest , seemed to fit him peculiarly for the Baron . She was acknowledged to be quite right , and the two parts being accepted accordingly , she was certain of the proper Frederick . Three of the characters were now cast , besides Mr. Rushworth , who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything ; when Julia , meaning , like her sister , to be Agatha , began to be scrupulous on Miss Crawford \u2019s account . \u201c This is not behaving well by the absent , \u201d said she . \u201c Here are not women enough . Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me , but here is nothing for your sister , Mr. Crawford . \u201d Mr. Crawford desired _ that _ might not be thought of : he was very sure his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful , and that she would not allow herself to be considered in the present case . But this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram , who asserted the part of Amelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford , if she would accept it . \u201c It falls as naturally , as necessarily to her , \u201d said he , \u201c as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters . It can be no sacrifice on their side , for it is highly comic . \u201d A short silence followed . Each sister looked anxious ; for each felt the best claim to Agatha , and was hoping to have it pressed on her by the rest . Henry Crawford , who meanwhile had taken up the play , and with seeming carelessness was turning over the first act , soon settled the business . \u201c I must entreat Miss _ Julia _ Bertram , \u201d said he , \u201c not to engage in the part of Agatha , or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity . You must not , indeed you must not \u201d ( turning to her ) . \u201c I could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness . The many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me , and Frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away . \u201d Pleasantly , courteously , it was spoken ; but the manner was lost in the matter to Julia \u2019s feelings . She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the injury to herself : it was a scheme , a trick ; she was slighted , Maria was preferred ; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress shewed how well it was understood ; and before Julia could command herself enough to speak , her brother gave his weight against her too , by saying , \u201c Oh yes ! Maria must be Agatha . Maria will be the best Agatha . Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy , I would not trust her in it . There is nothing of tragedy about her . She has not the look of it . Her features are not tragic features , and she walks too quick , and speaks too quick , and would not keep her countenance . She had better do the old countrywoman : the Cottager \u2019s wife ; you had , indeed , Julia . Cottager \u2019s wife is a very pretty part , I assure you . The old lady relieves the high - flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit . You shall be Cottager \u2019s wife . \u201d \u201c Cottager \u2019s wife ! \u201d cried Mr. Yates . \u201c What are you talking of ? The most trivial , paltry , insignificant part ; the merest commonplace ; not a tolerable speech in the whole . Your sister do that ! It is an insult to propose it . At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it . We all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else . A little more justice , Mr. Manager , if you please . You do not deserve the office , if you can not appreciate the talents of your company a little better . \u201d \u201c Why , as to _ that _ , my good friend , till I and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork ; but I mean no disparagement to Julia . We can not have two Agathas , and we must have one Cottager \u2019s wife ; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old Butler . If the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it ; and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous , let her take Cottager \u2019s speeches instead of Cottager \u2019s wife \u2019s , and so change the parts all through ; _ he _ is solemn and pathetic enough , I am sure . It could make no difference in the play , and as for Cottager himself , when he has got his wife \u2019s speeches , _ I _ would undertake him with all my heart . \u201d \u201c With all your partiality for Cottager \u2019s wife , \u201d said Henry Crawford , \u201c it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister , and we must not suffer her good - nature to be imposed on . We must not _ allow _ her to accept the part . She must not be left to her own complaisance . Her talents will be wanted in Amelia . Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha . I consider Amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece . It requires great powers , great nicety , to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance . I have seen good actresses fail in the part . Simplicity , indeed , is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession . It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not . It requires a gentlewoman \u2014 a Julia Bertram . You _ will _ undertake it , I hope ? \u201d turning to her with a look of anxious entreaty , which softened her a little ; but while she hesitated what to say , her brother again interposed with Miss Crawford \u2019s better claim . \u201c No , no , Julia must not be Amelia . It is not at all the part for her . She would not like it . She would not do well . She is too tall and robust . Amelia should be a small , light , girlish , skipping figure . It is fit for Miss Crawford , and Miss Crawford only . She looks the part , and I am persuaded will do it admirably . \u201d Without attending to this , Henry Crawford continued his supplication . \u201c You must oblige us , \u201d said he , \u201c indeed you must . When you have studied the character , I am sure you will feel it suit you . Tragedy may be your choice , but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _ you _ . You will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions ; you will not refuse to visit me in prison ? I think I see you coming in with your basket . \u201d The influence of his voice was felt . Julia wavered ; but was he only trying to soothe and pacify her , and make her overlook the previous affront ? She distrusted him . The slight had been most determined . He was , perhaps , but at treacherous play with her . She looked suspiciously at her sister ; Maria \u2019s countenance was to decide it : if she were vexed and alarmed \u2014 but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction , and Julia well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense . With hasty indignation , therefore , and a tremulous voice , she said to him , \u201c You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket of provisions \u2014 though one might have supposed \u2014 but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering ! \u201d She stopped \u2014 Henry Crawford looked rather foolish , and as if he did not know what to say . Tom Bertram began again \u2014 \u201c Miss Crawford must be Amelia . She will be an excellent Amelia . \u201d \u201c Do not be afraid of _ my _ wanting the character , \u201d cried Julia , with angry quickness : \u201c I am _ not _ to be Agatha , and I am sure I will do nothing else ; and as to Amelia , it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me . I quite detest her . An odious , little , pert , unnatural , impudent girl . I have always protested against comedy , and this is comedy in its worst form . \u201d And so saying , she walked hastily out of the room , leaving awkward feelings to more than one , but exciting small compassion in any except Fanny , who had been a quiet auditor of the whole , and who could not think of her as under the agitations of _ jealousy _ without great pity . A short silence succeeded her leaving them ; but her brother soon returned to business and Lovers \u2019 Vows , and was eagerly looking over the play , with Mr. Yates \u2019s help , to ascertain what scenery would be necessary \u2014 while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under - voice , and the declaration with which she began of , \u201c I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly , but that though I shall probably do it very ill , I feel persuaded _ she _ would do it worse , \u201d was doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for . When this had lasted some time , the division of the party was completed by Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in the room now beginning to be called _ the _ _ Theatre _ , and Miss Bertram \u2019s resolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia to Miss Crawford ; and Fanny remained alone . The first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume which had been left on the table , and begin to acquaint herself with the play of which she had heard so much . Her curiosity was all awake , and she ran through it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals of astonishment , that it could be chosen in the present instance , that it could be proposed and accepted in a private theatre ! Agatha and Amelia appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home representation \u2014 the situation of one , and the language of the other , so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty , that she could hardly suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in ; and longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which Edmund would certainly make .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [28, 30], "text": "the carpenter"}, {"position": [32, 33], "text": "his"}, {"position": [36, 37], "text": "his"}], "name": "the carpenter"},
