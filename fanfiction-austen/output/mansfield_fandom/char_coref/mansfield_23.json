{"document": "XXIII \u201c But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny ? \u201d said Lady Bertram . \u201c How came she to think of asking Fanny ? Fanny never dines there , you know , in this sort of way . I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go . Fanny , you do not want to go , do you ? \u201d \u201c If you put such a question to her , \u201d cried Edmund , preventing his cousin \u2019s speaking , \u201c Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure , my dear mother , she would like to go ; and I can see no reason why she should not . \u201d \u201c I can not imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her ? She never did before . She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny . \u201d \u201c If you can not do without me , ma\u2019am \u2014 \u201d said Fanny , in a self - denying tone . \u201c But my mother will have my father with her all the evening . \u201d \u201c To be sure , so I shall . \u201d \u201c Suppose you take my father \u2019s opinion , ma\u2019am . \u201d \u201c That \u2019s well thought of . So I will , Edmund . I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . \u201d \u201c As you please , ma\u2019am , on that head ; but I meant my father \u2019s opinion as to the _ propriety _ of the invitation \u2019s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the _ first _ invitation it should be accepted . \u201d \u201c I do not know . We will ask him . But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all . \u201d There was nothing more to be said , or that could be said to any purpose , till Sir Thomas were present ; but the subject involving , as it did , her own evening \u2019s comfort for the morrow , was so much uppermost in Lady Bertram \u2019s mind , that half an hour afterwards , on his looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing - room , she called him back again , when he had almost closed the door , with \u201c Sir Thomas , stop a moment \u2014 I have something to say to you . \u201d Her tone of calm languor , for she never took the trouble of raising her voice , was always heard and attended to ; and Sir Thomas came back . Her story began ; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room ; for to hear herself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her nerves could bear . She was anxious , she knew \u2014 more anxious perhaps than she ought to be \u2014 for what was it after all whether she went or staid ? but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding , and with very grave looks , and those grave looks directed to her , and at last decide against her , she might not be able to appear properly submissive and indifferent . Her cause , meanwhile , went on well . It began , on Lady Bertram \u2019s part , with\u2014\u201cI have something to tell you that will surprise you . Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner . \u201d \u201c Well , \u201d said Sir Thomas , as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise . \u201c Edmund wants her to go . But how can I spare her ? \u201d \u201c She will be late , \u201d said Sir Thomas , taking out his watch ; \u201c but what is your difficulty ? \u201d Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his mother \u2019s story . He told the whole ; and she had only to add , \u201c So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . \u201d \u201c But is it not very natural , \u201d observed Edmund , \u201c that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? \u201d \u201c Nothing can be more natural , \u201d said Sir Thomas , after a short deliberation ; \u201c nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural . Mrs. Grant \u2019s shewing civility to Miss Price , to Lady Bertram \u2019s niece , could never want explanation . The only surprise I can feel is , that this should be the _ first _ time of its being paid . Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer . She appears to feel as she ought . But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . \u201d \u201c But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ? \u201d \u201c Indeed I think you may . \u201d \u201c She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . \u201d \u201c Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . \u201d \u201c Very well , then , Fanny may go , Edmund . \u201d The good news soon followed her . Edmund knocked at her door in his way to his own . \u201c Well , Fanny , it is all happily settled , and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle \u2019s side . He had but one opinion . You are to go . \u201d \u201c Thank you , I am _ so _ glad , \u201d was Fanny \u2019s instinctive reply ; though when she had turned from him and shut the door , she could not help feeling , \u201c And yet why should I be glad ? for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me ? \u201d In spite of this conviction , however , she was glad . Simple as such an engagement might appear in other eyes , it had novelty and importance in hers , for excepting the day at Sotherton , she had scarcely ever dined out before ; and though now going only half a mile , and only to three people , still it was dining out , and all the little interests of preparation were enjoyments in themselves . She had neither sympathy nor assistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and directed her taste ; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody , and Mrs. Norris , when she came on the morrow , in consequence of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas , was in a very ill humour , and seemed intent only on lessening her niece \u2019s pleasure , both present and future , as much as possible . \u201c Upon my word , Fanny , you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence ! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated . Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to _ you _ ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me . Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _ us _ to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all . \u201d Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant \u2019s part of the favour , that Fanny , who found herself expected to speak , could only say that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her , and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt \u2019s evening work in such a state as to prevent her being missed . \u201c Oh ! depend upon it , your aunt can do very well without you , or you would not be allowed to go . _ I _ shall be here , so you may be quite easy about your aunt . And I hope you will have a very _ agreeable _ day , and find it all mighty _ delightful _ . But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table ; and I can not but be surprised that such an _ elegant _ lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better ! And round their enormous great wide table , too , which fills up the room so dreadfully ! Had the doctor been contented to take my dining - table when I came away , as anybody in their senses would have done , instead of having that absurd new one of his own , which is wider , literally wider than the dinner - table here , how infinitely better it would have been ! and how much more he would have been respected ! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere . Remember that , Fanny . Five \u2014 only five to be sitting round that table . However , you will have dinner enough on it for ten , I dare say . \u201d Mrs. Norris fetched breath , and went on again . \u201c The nonsense and folly of people \u2019s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins \u2014 as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia . _ That _ will never do , believe me . Remember , wherever you are , you must be the lowest and last ; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage , you are not to be taking place of her . And as to coming away at night , you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses . Leave him to settle _ that _ . \u201d \u201c Yes , ma\u2019am , I should not think of anything else . \u201d \u201c And if it should rain , which I think exceedingly likely , for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life , you must manage as well as you can , and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you . I certainly do not go home to - night , and , therefore , the carriage will not be out on my account ; so you must make up your mind to what may happen , and take your things accordingly . \u201d Her niece thought it perfectly reasonable . She rated her own claims to comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could ; and when Sir Thomas soon afterwards , just opening the door , said , \u201c Fanny , at what time would you have the carriage come round ? \u201d she felt a degree of astonishment which made it impossible for her to speak . \u201c My dear Sir Thomas ! \u201d cried Mrs. Norris , red with anger , \u201c Fanny can walk . \u201d \u201c Walk ! \u201d repeated Sir Thomas , in a tone of most unanswerable dignity , and coming farther into the room . \u201c My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year ! Will twenty minutes after four suit you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir , \u201d was Fanny \u2019s humble answer , given with the feelings almost of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris ; and not bearing to remain with her in what might seem a state of triumph , she followed her uncle out of the room , having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words spoken in angry agitation \u2014 \u201c Quite unnecessary ! a great deal too kind ! But Edmund goes ; true , it is upon Edmund \u2019s account . I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night . \u201d But this could not impose on Fanny . She felt that the carriage was for herself , and herself alone : and her uncle \u2019s consideration of her , coming immediately after such representations from her aunt , cost her some tears of gratitude when she was alone . The coachman drove round to a minute ; another minute brought down the gentleman ; and as the lady had , with a most scrupulous fear of being late , been many minutes seated in the drawing - room , Sir Thomas saw them off in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required . \u201c Now I must look at you , Fanny , \u201d said Edmund , with the kind smile of an affectionate brother , \u201c and tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed . What have you got on ? \u201d \u201c The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin \u2019s marriage . I hope it is not too fine ; but I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could , and that I might not have such another opportunity all the winter . I hope you do not think me too fine . \u201d \u201c A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white . No , I see no finery about you ; nothing but what is perfectly proper . Your gown seems very pretty . I like these glossy spots . Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same ? \u201d In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable - yard and coach - house . \u201c Heyday ! \u201d said Edmund , \u201c here \u2019s company , here \u2019s a carriage ! who have they got to meet us ? \u201d And letting down the side - glass to distinguish , \u201c \u2019 Tis Crawford \u2019s , Crawford \u2019s barouche , I protest ! There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters . He is here , of course . This is quite a surprise , Fanny . I shall be very glad to see him . \u201d There was no occasion , there was no time for Fanny to say how very differently she felt ; but the idea of having such another to observe her was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing - room . In the drawing - room Mr. Crawford certainly was , having been just long enough arrived to be ready for dinner ; and the smiles and pleased looks of the three others standing round him , shewed how welcome was his sudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath . A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund ; and with the exception of Fanny , the pleasure was general ; and even to _ her _ there might be some advantage in his presence , since every addition to the party must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent and unattended to . She was soon aware of this herself ; for though she must submit , as her own propriety of mind directed , in spite of her aunt Norris \u2019s opinion , to being the principal lady in company , and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon , she found , while they were at table , such a happy flow of conversation prevailing , in which she was not required to take any part \u2014 there was so much to be said between the brother and sister about Bath , so much between the two young men about hunting , so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and Dr. Grant , and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant , as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet , and of passing a very agreeable day . She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman , however , with any appearance of interest , in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield , and sending for his hunters from Norfolk , which , suggested by Dr. Grant , advised by Edmund , and warmly urged by the two sisters , was soon in possession of his mind , and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her to resolve on . Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of the open weather , but her answers were as short and indifferent as civility allowed . She could not wish him to stay , and would much rather not have him speak to her . Her two absent cousins , especially Maria , were much in her thoughts on seeing him ; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _ his _ spirits . Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before , and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams , as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state . She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way , till they were all re - assembled in the drawing - room , when Edmund , being engaged apart in some matter of business with Dr. Grant , which seemed entirely to engross them , and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea - table , he began talking of them with more particularity to his other sister . With a significant smile , which made Fanny quite hate him , he said , \u201c So ! Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton , I understand ; happy man ! \u201d \u201c Yes , they have been there about a fortnight , Miss Price , have they not ? And Julia is with them . \u201d \u201c And Mr. Yates , I presume , is not far off . \u201d \u201c Mr. Yates ! Oh ! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates . I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park ; do you , Miss Price ? I think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates . \u201d \u201c Poor Rushworth and his two - and - forty speeches ! \u201d continued Crawford . \u201c Nobody can ever forget them . Poor fellow ! I see him now \u2014 his toil and his despair . Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her \u201d ; adding , with a momentary seriousness , \u201c She is too good for him \u2014 much too good . \u201d And then changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry , and addressing Fanny , he said , \u201c You were Mr. Rushworth \u2019s best friend . Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten , your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part \u2014 in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied \u2014 to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own ! _ He _ might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness , but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party . \u201d Fanny coloured , and said nothing . \u201c It is as a dream , a pleasant dream ! \u201d he exclaimed , breaking forth again , after a few minutes \u2019 musing . \u201c I shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure . There was such an interest , such an animation , such a spirit diffused . Everybody felt it . We were all alive . There was employment , hope , solicitude , bustle , for every hour of the day . Always some little objection , some little doubt , some little anxiety to be got over . I never was happier . \u201d With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself , \u201c Never happier!\u2014never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable!\u2014never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly ! Oh ! what a corrupted mind ! \u201d \u201c We were unlucky , Miss Price , \u201d he continued , in a lower tone , to avoid the possibility of being heard by Edmund , and not at all aware of her feelings , \u201c we certainly were very unlucky . Another week , only one other week , would have been enough for us . I think if we had had the disposal of events \u2014 if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two , about the equinox , there would have been a difference . Not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather \u2014 but only by a steady contrary wind , or a calm . I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week \u2019s calm in the Atlantic at that season . \u201d He seemed determined to be answered ; and Fanny , averting her face , said , with a firmer tone than usual , \u201c As far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day . My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive , that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough . \u201d She had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before , and never so angrily to any one ; and when her speech was over , she trembled and blushed at her own daring . He was surprised ; but after a few moments \u2019 silent consideration of her , replied in a calmer , graver tone , and as if the candid result of conviction , \u201c I believe you are right . It was more pleasant than prudent . We were getting too noisy . \u201d And then turning the conversation , he would have engaged her on some other subject , but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not advance in any . Miss Crawford , who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund , now observed , \u201c Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . \u201d \u201c The most interesting in the world , \u201d replied her brother\u2014\u201chow to make money ; how to turn a good income into a better . Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon . I find he takes orders in a few weeks . They were at it in the dining - parlour . I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off . He will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with , and earned without much trouble . I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year . Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother ; and as of course he will still live at home , it will be all for his _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ ; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter , I suppose , will be the sum total of sacrifice . \u201d His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying , \u201c Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves . You would look rather blank , Henry , if your _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ were to be limited to seven hundred a year . \u201d \u201c Perhaps I might ; but all _ that _ you know is entirely comparative . Birthright and habit must settle the business . Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet \u2019s family . By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year , and nothing to do for it . \u201d Miss Crawford _ could _ have said that there would be a something to do and to suffer for it , which she could not think lightly of ; but she checked herself and let it pass ; and tried to look calm and unconcerned when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them . \u201c Bertram , \u201d said Henry Crawford , \u201c I shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon . I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner . When is it to be ? Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ? Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time \u2014 as I shall do \u2014 not to lose a word ; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful ? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil . When will it be ? You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you . \u201d \u201c I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , \u201d said Edmund ; \u201c for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . \u201d \u201c Will he not feel this ? \u201d thought Fanny . \u201c No , he can feel nothing as he ought . \u201d The party being now all united , and the chief talkers attracting each other , she remained in tranquillity ; and as a whist - table was formed after tea \u2014 formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant , by his attentive wife , though it was not to be supposed so \u2014 and Miss Crawford took her harp , she had nothing to do but to listen ; and her tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening , except when Mr. Crawford now and then addressed to her a question or observation , which she could not avoid answering . Miss Crawford was too much vexed by what had passed to be in a humour for anything but music . With that she soothed herself and amused her friend . The assurance of Edmund \u2019s being so soon to take orders , coming upon her like a blow that had been suspended , and still hoped uncertain and at a distance , was felt with resentment and mortification . She was very angry with him . She had thought her influence more . She _ had _ begun to think of him ; she felt that she had , with great regard , with almost decided intentions ; but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings . It was plain that he could have no serious views , no true attachment , by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to . She would learn to match him in his indifference . She would henceforth admit his attentions without any idea beyond immediate amusement . If _ he _ could so command his affections , _ hers _ should do her no harm .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [5, 7], "text": "Mrs. Grant"}, {"position": [18, 19], "text": "she"},
