{"document": "IV Tom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he could be only nominally missed ; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished to find how very well they did even without his father , how well Edmund could supply his place in carving , talking to the steward , writing to the attorney , settling with the servants , and equally saving her from all possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of directing her letters . The earliest intelligence of the travellers \u2019 safe arrival at Antigua , after a favourable voyage , was received ; though not before Mrs. Norris had been indulging in very dreadful fears , and trying to make Edmund participate them whenever she could get him alone ; and as she depended on being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe , she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others , when Sir Thomas \u2019s assurances of their both being alive and well made it necessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while . The winter came and passed without their being called for ; the accounts continued perfectly good ; and Mrs. Norris , in promoting gaieties for her nieces , assisting their toilets , displaying their accomplishments , and looking about for their future husbands , had so much to do as , in addition to all her own household cares , some interference in those of her sister , and Mrs. Grant \u2019s wasteful doings to overlook , left her very little occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent . The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the neighbourhood ; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements a manner naturally easy , and carefully formed to general civility and obligingness , they possessed its favour as well as its admiration . Their vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it , and gave themselves no airs ; while the praises attending such behaviour , secured and brought round by their aunt , served to strengthen them in believing they had no faults . Lady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters . She was too indolent even to accept a mother \u2019s gratification in witnessing their success and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble , and the charge was made over to her sister , who desired nothing better than a post of such honourable representation , and very thoroughly relished the means it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses to hire . Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season ; but she enjoyed being avowedly useful as her aunt \u2019s companion when they called away the rest of the family ; and , as Miss Lee had left Mansfield , she naturally became everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party . She talked to her , listened to her , read to her ; and the tranquillity of such evenings , her perfect security in such a _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ from any sound of unkindness , was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom known a pause in its alarms or embarrassments . As to her cousins \u2019 gaieties , she loved to hear an account of them , especially of the balls , and whom Edmund had danced with ; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same , and listened , therefore , without an idea of any nearer concern in them . Upon the whole , it was a comfortable winter to her ; for though it brought no William to England , the never - failing hope of his arrival was worth much . The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend , the old grey pony ; and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health as well as in her affections ; for in spite of the acknowledged importance of her riding on horse - back , no measures were taken for mounting her again , \u201c because , \u201d as it was observed by her aunts , \u201c she might ride one of her cousin \u2019s horses at any time when they did not want them , \u201d and as the Miss Bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day , and had no idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real pleasure , that time , of course , never came . They took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings of April and May ; and Fanny either sat at home the whole day with one aunt , or walked beyond her strength at the instigation of the other : Lady Bertram holding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as it was unpleasant to herself ; and Mrs. Norris , who was walking all day , thinking everybody ought to walk as much . Edmund was absent at this time , or the evil would have been earlier remedied . When he returned , to understand how Fanny was situated , and perceived its ill effects , there seemed with him but one thing to be done ; and that \u201c Fanny must have a horse \u201d was the resolute declaration with which he opposed whatever could be urged by the supineness of his mother , or the economy of his aunt , to make it appear unimportant . Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some steady old thing might be found among the numbers belonging to the Park that would do vastly well ; or that one might be borrowed of the steward ; or that perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to the post . She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary , and even improper , that Fanny should have a regular lady \u2019s horse of her own , in the style of her cousins . She was sure Sir Thomas had never intended it : and she must say that , to be making such a purchase in his absence , and adding to the great expenses of his stable , at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled , seemed to her very unjustifiable . \u201c Fanny must have a horse , \u201d was Edmund \u2019s only reply . Mrs. Norris could not see it in the same light . Lady Bertram did : she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity of it , and as to its being considered necessary by his father ; she only pleaded against there being any hurry ; she only wanted him to wait till Sir Thomas \u2019s return , and then Sir Thomas might settle it all himself . He would be at home in September , and where would be the harm of only waiting till September ? Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his mother , as evincing least regard for her niece , he could not help paying more attention to what she said ; and at length determined on a method of proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father \u2019s thinking he had done too much , and at the same time procure for Fanny the immediate means of exercise , which he could not bear she should be without . He had three horses of his own , but not one that would carry a woman . Two of them were hunters ; the third , a useful road - horse : this third he resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride ; he knew where such a one was to be met with ; and having once made up his mind , the whole business was soon completed . The new mare proved a treasure ; with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose , and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her . She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the old grey pony ; but her delight in Edmund \u2019s mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort ; and the addition it was ever receiving in the consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung , was beyond all her words to express . She regarded her cousin as an example of everything good and great , as possessing worth which no one but herself could ever appreciate , and as entitled to such gratitude from her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay . Her sentiments towards him were compounded of all that was respectful , grateful , confiding , and tender . As the horse continued in name , as well as fact , the property of Edmund , Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny \u2019s use ; and had Lady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again , he might have been excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas \u2019s return in September , for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad , and without any near prospect of finishing his business . Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards England ; and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then involved determined him on sending home his son , and waiting the final arrangement by himself . Tom arrived safely , bringing an excellent account of his father \u2019s health ; but to very little purpose , as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned . Sir Thomas \u2019s sending away his son seemed to her so like a parent \u2019s care , under the influence of a foreboding of evil to himself , that she could not help feeling dreadful presentiments ; and as the long evenings of autumn came on , was so terribly haunted by these ideas , in the sad solitariness of her cottage , as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining - room of the Park . The return of winter engagements , however , was not without its effect ; and in the course of their progress , her mind became so pleasantly occupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest niece , as tolerably to quiet her nerves . \u201c If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return , it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married , \u201d she very often thought ; always when they were in the company of men of fortune , and particularly on the introduction of a young man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest places in the country . Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram , and , being inclined to marry , soon fancied himself in love . He was a heavy young man , with not more than common sense ; but as there was nothing disagreeable in his figure or address , the young lady was well pleased with her conquest . Being now in her twenty - first year , Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty ; and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father \u2019s , as well as ensure her the house in town , which was now a prime object , it became , by the same rule of moral obligation , her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could . Mrs. Norris was most zealous in promoting the match , by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party ; and , among other means , by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman \u2019s mother , who at present lived with him , and to whom she even forced Lady Bertram to go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit . It was not long before a good understanding took place between this lady and herself . Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry , and declared that of all the young ladies she had ever seen , Miss Bertram seemed , by her amiable qualities and accomplishments , the best adapted to make him happy . Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment , and admired the nice discernment of character which could so well distinguish merit . Maria was indeed the pride and delight of them all \u2014 perfectly faultless \u2014 an angel ; and , of course , so surrounded by admirers , must be difficult in her choice : but yet , as far as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance , Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her . After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls , the young people justified these opinions , and an engagement , with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas , was entered into , much to the satisfaction of their respective families , and of the general lookers - on of the neighbourhood , who had , for many weeks past , felt the expediency of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s marrying Miss Bertram . It was some months before Sir Thomas \u2019s consent could be received ; but , in the meanwhile , as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the connexion , the intercourse of the two families was carried on without restraint , and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs. Norris \u2019s talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at present . Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the business ; but no representation of his aunt \u2019s could induce him to find Mr. Rushworth a desirable companion . He could allow his sister to be the best judge of her own happiness , but he was not pleased that her happiness should centre in a large income ; nor could he refrain from often saying to himself , in Mr. Rushworth \u2019s company\u2014\u201cIf this man had not twelve thousand a year , he would be a very stupid fellow . \u201d Sir Thomas , however , was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so unquestionably advantageous , and of which he heard nothing but the perfectly good and agreeable . It was a connexion exactly of the right sort \u2014 in the same county , and the same interest \u2014 and his most hearty concurrence was conveyed as soon as possible . He only conditioned that the marriage should not take place before his return , which he was again looking eagerly forward to . He wrote in April , and had strong hopes of settling everything to his entire satisfaction , and leaving Antigua before the end of the summer . Such was the state of affairs in the month of July ; and Fanny had just reached her eighteenth year , when the society of the village received an addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant , a Mr. and Miss Crawford , the children of her mother by a second marriage . They were young people of fortune . The son had a good estate in Norfolk , the daughter twenty thousand pounds . As children , their sister had been always very fond of them ; but , as her own marriage had been soon followed by the death of their common parent , which left them to the care of a brother of their father , of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing , she had scarcely seen them since . In their uncle \u2019s house they had found a kind home . Admiral and Mrs. Crawford , though agreeing in nothing else , were united in affection for these children , or , at least , were no farther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite , to whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two . The Admiral delighted in the boy , Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl ; and it was the lady \u2019s death which now obliged her _ protegee _ , after some months \u2019 further trial at her uncle \u2019s house , to find another home . Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct , who chose , instead of retaining his niece , to bring his mistress under his own roof ; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted for her sister \u2019s proposal of coming to her , a measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other ; for Mrs. Grant , having by this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the country without a family of children \u2014 having more than filled her favourite sitting - room with pretty furniture , and made a choice collection of plants and poultry \u2014 was very much in want of some variety at home . The arrival , therefore , of a sister whom she had always loved , and now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained single , was highly agreeable ; and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to London . Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions , though they arose principally from doubts of her sister \u2019s style of living and tone of society ; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house , that she could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations . To anything like a permanence of abode , or limitation of society , Henry Crawford had , unluckily , a great dislike : he could not accommodate his sister in an article of such importance ; but he escorted her , with the utmost kindness , into Northamptonshire , and as readily engaged to fetch her away again , at half an hour \u2019s notice , whenever she were weary of the place . The meeting was very satisfactory on each side . Miss Crawford found a sister without preciseness or rusticity , a sister \u2019s husband who looked the gentleman , and a house commodious and well fitted up ; and Mrs. Grant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and woman of very prepossessing appearance . Mary Crawford was remarkably pretty ; Henry , though not handsome , had air and countenance ; the manners of both were lively and pleasant , and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them credit for everything else . She was delighted with each , but Mary was her dearest object ; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her own , she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister \u2019s . She had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her : she had fixed on Tom Bertram ; the eldest son of a baronet was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds , with all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her ; and being a warm - hearted , unreserved woman , Mary had not been three hours in the house before she told her what she had planned . Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near them , and not at all displeased either at her sister \u2019s early care , or the choice it had fallen on . Matrimony was her object , provided she could marry well : and having seen Mr. Bertram in town , she knew that objection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life . While she treated it as a joke , therefore , she did not forget to think of it seriously . The scheme was soon repeated to Henry . \u201c And now , \u201d added Mrs. Grant , \u201c I have thought of something to make it complete . I should dearly love to settle you both in this country ; and therefore , Henry , you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram , a nice , handsome , good - humoured , accomplished girl , who will make you very happy . \u201d Henry bowed and thanked her . \u201c My dear sister , \u201d said Mary , \u201c if you can persuade him into anything of the sort , it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever , and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of . If you can persuade Henry to marry , you must have the address of a Frenchwoman . All that English abilities can do has been tried already . I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn ; and the pains which they , their mothers ( very clever women ) , as well as my dear aunt and myself , have taken to reason , coax , or trick him into marrying , is inconceivable ! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined . If your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke , let them avoid Henry . \u201d \u201c My dear brother , I will not believe this of you . \u201d \u201c No , I am sure you are too good . You will be kinder than Mary . You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience . I am of a cautious temper , and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry . Nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself . I consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet\u2014\u2018Heaven \u2019s _ last _ best gift . \u2019 \u201d \u201c There , Mrs. Grant , you see how he dwells on one word , and only look at his smile . I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral \u2019s lessons have quite spoiled him . \u201d \u201c I pay very little regard , \u201d said Mrs. Grant , \u201c to what any young person says on the subject of marriage . If they profess a disinclination for it , I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person . \u201d Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no disinclination to the state herself . \u201c Oh yes ! I am not at all ashamed of it . I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly : I do not like to have people throw themselves away ; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage . \u201d", "clusters":
