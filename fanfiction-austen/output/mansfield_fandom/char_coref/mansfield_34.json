{"document": "XXXIV Edmund had great things to hear on his return . Many surprises were awaiting him . The first that occurred was not least in interest : the appearance of Henry Crawford and his sister walking together through the village as he rode into it . He had concluded \u2014 he had meant them to be far distant . His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely to avoid Miss Crawford . He was returning to Mansfield with spirits ready to feed on melancholy remembrances , and tender associations , when her own fair self was before him , leaning on her brother \u2019s arm , and he found himself receiving a welcome , unquestionably friendly , from the woman whom , two moments before , he had been thinking of as seventy miles off , and as farther , much farther , from him in inclination than any distance could express . Her reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hoped for , had he expected to see her . Coming as he did from such a purport fulfilled as had taken him away , he would have expected anything rather than a look of satisfaction , and words of simple , pleasant meaning . It was enough to set his heart in a glow , and to bring him home in the properest state for feeling the full value of the other joyful surprises at hand . William \u2019s promotion , with all its particulars , he was soon master of ; and with such a secret provision of comfort within his own breast to help the joy , he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and unvarying cheerfulness all dinner - time . After dinner , when he and his father were alone , he had Fanny \u2019s history ; and then all the great events of the last fortnight , and the present situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him . Fanny suspected what was going on . They sat so much longer than usual in the dining - parlour , that she was sure they must be talking of her ; and when tea at last brought them away , and she was to be seen by Edmund again , she felt dreadfully guilty . He came to her , sat down by her , took her hand , and pressed it kindly ; and at that moment she thought that , but for the occupation and the scene which the tea - things afforded , she must have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable excess . He was not intending , however , by such action , to be conveying to her that unqualified approbation and encouragement which her hopes drew from it . It was designed only to express his participation in all that interested her , and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened every feeling of affection . He was , in fact , entirely on his father \u2019s side of the question . His surprise was not so great as his father \u2019s at her refusing Crawford , because , so far from supposing her to consider him with anything like a preference , he had always believed it to be rather the reverse , and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared , but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more desirable than he did . It had every recommendation to him ; and while honouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present indifference , honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo , he was most earnest in hoping , and sanguine in believing , that it would be a match at last , and that , united by mutual affection , it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other , as he was now beginning seriously to consider them . Crawford had been too precipitate . He had not given her time to attach herself . He had begun at the wrong end . With such powers as his , however , and such a disposition as hers , Edmund trusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion . Meanwhile , he saw enough of Fanny \u2019s embarrassment to make him scrupulously guard against exciting it a second time , by any word , or look , or movement . Crawford called the next day , and on the score of Edmund \u2019s return , Sir Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner ; it was really a necessary compliment . He staid of course , and Edmund had then ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny , and what degree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her manners ; and it was so little , so very , very little \u2014 every chance , every possibility of it , resting upon her embarrassment only ; if there was not hope in her confusion , there was hope in nothing else \u2014 that he was almost ready to wonder at his friend \u2019s perseverance . Fanny was worth it all ; he held her to be worth every effort of patience , every exertion of mind , but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any woman breathing , without something more to warm his courage than his eyes could discern in hers . He was very willing to hope that Crawford saw clearer , and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friend that he could come to from all that he observed to pass before , and at , and after dinner . In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more promising . When he and Crawford walked into the drawing - room , his mother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there were nothing else to care for . Edmund could not help noticing their apparently deep tranquillity . \u201c We have not been so silent all the time , \u201d replied his mother . \u201c Fanny has been reading to me , and only put the book down upon hearing you coming . \u201d And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air of being very recently closed : a volume of Shakespeare . \u201c She often reads to me out of those books ; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man\u2019s \u2014 what \u2019s his name , Fanny?\u2014when we heard your footsteps . \u201d Crawford took the volume . \u201c Let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship , \u201d said he . \u201c I shall find it immediately . \u201d And by carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves , he did find it , or within a page or two , quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram , who assured him , as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey , that he had got the very speech . Not a look or an offer of help had Fanny given ; not a syllable for or against . All her attention was for her work . She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else . But taste was too strong in her . She could not abstract her mind five minutes : she was forced to listen ; his reading was capital , and her pleasure in good reading extreme . To _ good _ reading , however , she had been long used : her uncle read well , her cousins all , Edmund very well , but in Mr. Crawford \u2019s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond what she had ever met with . The King , the Queen , Buckingham , Wolsey , Cromwell , all were given in turn ; for with the happiest knack , the happiest power of jumping and guessing , he could always alight at will on the best scene , or the best speeches of each ; and whether it were dignity , or pride , or tenderness , or remorse , or whatever were to be expressed , he could do it with equal beauty . It was truly dramatic . His acting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play might give , and his reading brought all his acting before her again ; nay , perhaps with greater enjoyment , for it came unexpectedly , and with no such drawback as she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss Bertram . Edmund watched the progress of her attention , and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework , which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally : how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it , and at last , how the eyes which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford \u2014 fixed on him for minutes , fixed on him , in short , till the attraction drew Crawford \u2019s upon her , and the book was closed , and the charm was broken . Then she was shrinking again into herself , and blushing and working as hard as ever ; but it had been enough to give Edmund encouragement for his friend , and as he cordially thanked him , he hoped to be expressing Fanny \u2019s secret feelings too . \u201c That play must be a favourite with you , \u201d said he ; \u201c you read as if you knew it well . \u201d \u201c It will be a favourite , I believe , from this hour , \u201d replied Crawford ; \u201c but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen . I once saw Henry the Eighth acted , or I have heard of it from somebody who did , I am not certain which . But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how . It is a part of an Englishman \u2019s constitution . His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere ; one is intimate with him by instinct . No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately . \u201d \u201c No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c from one \u2019s earliest years . His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody ; they are in half the books we open , and we all talk Shakespeare , use his similes , and describe with his descriptions ; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it . To know him in bits and scraps is common enough ; to know him pretty thoroughly is , perhaps , not uncommon ; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent . \u201d \u201c Sir , you do me honour , \u201d was Crawford \u2019s answer , with a bow of mock gravity . Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny , to see if a word of accordant praise could be extorted from her ; yet both feeling that it could not be . Her praise had been given in her attention ; _ that _ must content them . Lady Bertram \u2019s admiration was expressed , and strongly too . \u201c It was really like being at a play , \u201d said she . \u201c I wish Sir Thomas had been here . \u201d Crawford was excessively pleased . If Lady Bertram , with all her incompetency and languor , could feel this , the inference of what her niece , alive and enlightened as she was , must feel , was elevating . \u201c You have a great turn for acting , I am sure , Mr. Crawford , \u201d said her ladyship soon afterwards ; \u201c and I will tell you what , I think you will have a theatre , some time or other , at your house in Norfolk . I mean when you are settled there . I do indeed . I think you will fit up a theatre at your house in Norfolk . \u201d \u201c Do you , ma\u2019am ? \u201d cried he , with quickness . \u201c No , no , that will never be . Your ladyship is quite mistaken . No theatre at Everingham ! Oh no ! \u201d And he looked at Fanny with an expressive smile , which evidently meant , \u201c That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham . \u201d Edmund saw it all , and saw Fanny so determined _ not _ to see it , as to make it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of the protestation ; and such a quick consciousness of compliment , such a ready comprehension of a hint , he thought , was rather favourable than not . The subject of reading aloud was farther discussed . The two young men were the only talkers , but they , standing by the fire , talked over the too common neglect of the qualification , the total inattention to it , in the ordinary school - system for boys , the consequently natural , yet in some instances almost unnatural , degree of ignorance and uncouthness of men , of sensible and well - informed men , when suddenly called to the necessity of reading aloud , which had fallen within their notice , giving instances of blunders , and failures with their secondary causes , the want of management of the voice , of proper modulation and emphasis , of foresight and judgment , all proceeding from the first cause : want of early attention and habit ; and Fanny was listening again with great entertainment . \u201c Even in my profession , \u201d said Edmund , with a smile , \u201c how little the art of reading has been studied ! how little a clear manner , and good delivery , have been attended to ! I speak rather of the past , however , than the present . There is now a spirit of improvement abroad ; but among those who were ordained twenty , thirty , forty years ago , the larger number , to judge by their performance , must have thought reading was reading , and preaching was preaching . It is different now . The subject is more justly considered . It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths ; and besides , there is more general observation and taste , a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly ; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter , and who can judge and criticise . \u201d Edmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination ; and upon this being understood , he had a variety of questions from Crawford as to his feelings and success ; questions , which being made , though with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste , without any touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew to be most offensive to Fanny , he had true pleasure in satisfying ; and when Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the properest manner in which particular passages in the service should be delivered , shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before , and thought with judgment , Edmund was still more and more pleased . This would be the way to Fanny \u2019s heart . She was not to be won by all that gallantry and wit and good - nature together could do ; or , at least , she would not be won by them nearly so soon , without the assistance of sentiment and feeling , and seriousness on serious subjects . \u201c Our liturgy , \u201d observed Crawford , \u201c has beauties , which not even a careless , slovenly style of reading can destroy ; but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt . For myself , at least , I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be \u201d ( here was a glance at Fanny ) ; \u201c that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read , and longing to have it to read myself . Did you speak ? \u201d stepping eagerly to Fanny , and addressing her in a softened voice ; and upon her saying \u201c No , \u201d he added , \u201c Are you sure you did not speak ? I saw your lips move . I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive , and not _ allow _ my thoughts to wander . Are not you going to tell me so ? \u201d \u201c No , indeed , you know your duty too well for me to \u2014 even supposing \u2014 \u201d She stopt , felt herself getting into a puzzle , and could not be prevailed on to add another word , not by dint of several minutes of supplication and waiting . He then returned to his former station , and went on as if there had been no such tender interruption . \u201c A sermon , well delivered , is more uncommon even than prayers well read . A sermon , good in itself , is no rare thing . It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well ; that is , the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study . A thoroughly good sermon , thoroughly well delivered , is a capital gratification . I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect , and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself . There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit , when it is really eloquence , which is entitled to the highest praise and honour . The preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers , on subjects limited , and long worn threadbare in all common hands ; who can say anything new or striking , anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste , or wearing out the feelings of his hearers , is a man whom one could not , in his public capacity , honour enough . I should like to be such a man . \u201d Edmund laughed . \u201c I should indeed . I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy . But then , I must have a London audience . I could not preach but to the educated ; to those who were capable of estimating my composition . And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often ; now and then , perhaps once or twice in the spring , after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together ; but not for a constancy ; it would not do for a constancy . \u201d Here Fanny , who could not but listen , involuntarily shook her head , and Crawford was instantly by her side again , entreating to know her meaning ; and as Edmund perceived , by his drawing in a chair , and sitting down close by her , that it was to be a very thorough attack , that looks and undertones were to be well tried , he sank as quietly as possible into a corner , turned his back , and took up a newspaper , very sincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover ; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in murmurs of his own , over the various advertisements of \u201c A most desirable Estate in South Wales \u201d ; \u201c To Parents and Guardians \u201d ; and a \u201c Capital season\u2019d Hunter . \u201d Fanny , meanwhile , vexed with herself for not having been as motionless as she was speechless , and grieved to the heart to see Edmund \u2019s arrangements , was trying by everything in the power of her modest , gentle nature , to repulse Mr. Crawford , and avoid both his looks and inquiries ; and he , unrepulsable , was persisting in both . \u201c What did that shake of the head mean ? \u201d said he . \u201c What was it meant to express ? Disapprobation , I fear . But of what ? What had I been saying to displease you ? Did you think me speaking improperly , lightly , irreverently on the subject ? Only tell me if I was . Only tell me if I was wrong . I want to be set right . Nay , nay , I entreat you ; for one moment put down your work . What did that shake of the head mean ? \u201d In vain was her \u201c Pray , sir , do n\u2019t ; pray , Mr. Crawford , \u201d repeated twice over ; and in vain did she try to move away . In the same low , eager voice , and the same close neighbourhood , he went on , reurging the same questions as before . She grew more agitated and displeased . \u201c How can you , sir ? You quite astonish me ; I wonder how you can \u2014 \u201d \u201c Do I astonish you ? \u201d said he . \u201c Do you wonder ? Is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand ? I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner , all that gives me an interest in what you look and do , and excites my present curiosity . I will not leave you to wonder long . \u201d In spite of herself , she could not help half a smile , but she said nothing . \u201c You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy . Yes , that was the word . Constancy : I am not afraid of the word . I would spell it , read it , write it with anybody . I see nothing alarming in the word . Did you think I ought ? \u201d \u201c Perhaps , sir , \u201d said Fanny , wearied at last into speaking\u2014\u201cperhaps , sir , I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment . \u201d Crawford , delighted to get her to speak at any rate , was determined to keep it up ; and poor Fanny , who had hoped to silence him by such an extremity of reproof , found herself sadly mistaken , and that it was only a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another . He had always something to entreat the explanation of . The opportunity was too fair . None such had occurred since his seeing her in her uncle \u2019s room , none such might occur again before his leaving Mansfield . Lady Bertram \u2019s being just on the other side of the table was a trifle , for she might always be considered as only half - awake , and Edmund \u2019s advertisements were still of the first utility . \u201c Well , \u201d said Crawford , after a course of rapid questions and reluctant answers ; \u201c I am happier than I was , because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me . You think me unsteady : easily swayed by the whim of the moment , easily tempted , easily put aside . With such an opinion , no wonder that \u2014 But we shall see.\u2014It is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged ; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady . My conduct shall speak for me ; absence , distance , time shall speak for me . _ They _ shall prove that , as far as you can be deserved by anybody , I do deserve you . You are infinitely my superior in merit ; all _ that _ I know . You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature . You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what \u2014 not merely beyond what one sees , because one never sees anything like it \u2014 but beyond what one fancies might be . But still I am not frightened . It is not by equality of merit that you can be won . That is out of the question . It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest , who loves you most devotedly , that has the best right to a return . There I build my confidence . By that right I do and will deserve you ; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it , I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes . Yes , dearest , sweetest Fanny . Nay \u201d ( seeing her draw back displeased ) , \u201c forgive me . Perhaps I have as yet no right ; but by what other name can I call you ? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other ? No , it is \u2018 Fanny \u2019 that I think of all day , and dream of all night . You have given the name such reality of sweetness , that nothing else can now be descriptive of you . \u201d Fanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer , or have refrained from at least trying to get away in spite of all the too public opposition she foresaw to it , had it not been for the sound of approaching relief , the very sound which she had been long watching for , and long thinking strangely delayed . The solemn procession , headed by Baddeley , of tea - board , urn , and cake - bearers , made its appearance , and delivered her from a grievous imprisonment of body and mind . Mr. Crawford was obliged to move . She was at liberty , she was busy , she was protected . Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those who might speak and hear . But though the conference had seemed full long to him , and though on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation , he inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened to without some profit to the speaker .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Edmund"}, {"position": [8, 9], "text": "his"}, {"position": [15, 16], "text": "him"}, {"position": [33,
