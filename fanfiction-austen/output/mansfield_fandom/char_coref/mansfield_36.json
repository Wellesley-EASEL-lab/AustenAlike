{"document": "XXXVI Edmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fanny could tell , or could leave to be conjectured of her sentiments , and he was satisfied . It had been , as he before presumed , too hasty a measure on Crawford \u2019s side , and time must be given to make the idea first familiar , and then agreeable to her . She must be used to the consideration of his being in love with her , and then a return of affection might not be very distant . He gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his father ; and recommended there being nothing more said to her : no farther attempts to influence or persuade ; but that everything should be left to Crawford \u2019s assiduities , and the natural workings of her own mind . Sir Thomas promised that it should be so . Edmund \u2019s account of Fanny \u2019s disposition he could believe to be just ; he supposed she had all those feelings , but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _ had _ ; for , less willing than his son to trust to the future , he could not help fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were necessary for her , she might not have persuaded herself into receiving his addresses properly before the young man \u2019s inclination for paying them were over . There was nothing to be done , however , but to submit quietly and hope the best . The promised visit from \u201c her friend , \u201d as Edmund called Miss Crawford , was a formidable threat to Fanny , and she lived in continual terror of it . As a sister , so partial and so angry , and so little scrupulous of what she said , and in another light so triumphant and secure , she was in every way an object of painful alarm . Her displeasure , her penetration , and her happiness were all fearful to encounter ; and the dependence of having others present when they met was Fanny \u2019s only support in looking forward to it . She absented herself as little as possible from Lady Bertram , kept away from the East room , and took no solitary walk in the shrubbery , in her caution to avoid any sudden attack . She succeeded . She was safe in the breakfast - room , with her aunt , when Miss Crawford did come ; and the first misery over , and Miss Crawford looking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than she had anticipated , Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse to be endured than a half - hour of moderate agitation . But here she hoped too much ; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity . She was determined to see Fanny alone , and therefore said to her tolerably soon , in a low voice , \u201c I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere \u201d ; words that Fanny felt all over her , in all her pulses and all her nerves . Denial was impossible . Her habits of ready submission , on the contrary , made her almost instantly rise and lead the way out of the room . She did it with wretched feelings , but it was inevitable . They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance was over on Miss Crawford \u2019s side . She immediately shook her head at Fanny with arch , yet affectionate reproach , and taking her hand , seemed hardly able to help beginning directly . She said nothing , however , but , \u201c Sad , sad girl ! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you , \u201d and had discretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure of having four walls to themselves . Fanny naturally turned upstairs , and took her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortable use ; opening the door , however , with a most aching heart , and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before her than ever that spot had yet witnessed . But the evil ready to burst on her was at least delayed by the sudden change in Miss Crawford \u2019s ideas ; by the strong effect on her mind which the finding herself in the East room again produced . \u201c Ha ! \u201d she cried , with instant animation , \u201c am I here again ? The East room ! Once only was I in this room before \u201d ; and after stopping to look about her , and seemingly to retrace all that had then passed , she added , \u201c Once only before . Do you remember it ? I came to rehearse . Your cousin came too ; and we had a rehearsal . You were our audience and prompter . A delightful rehearsal . I shall never forget it . Here we were , just in this part of the room : here was your cousin , here was I , here were the chairs . Oh ! why will such things ever pass away ? \u201d Happily for her companion , she wanted no answer . Her mind was entirely self - engrossed . She was in a reverie of sweet remembrances . \u201c The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable ! The subject of it so very \u2014 very \u2014 what shall I say ? He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me . I think I see him now , trying to be as demure and composed as Anhalt ought , through the two long speeches . \u2018 When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state , matrimony may be called a happy life . \u2019 I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words . It was curious , very curious , that we should have such a scene to play ! If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence , it should be that week \u2014 that acting week . Say what you would , Fanny , it should be _ that _ ; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other . His sturdy spirit to bend as it did ! Oh ! it was sweet beyond expression . But alas , that very evening destroyed it all . That very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle . Poor Sir Thomas , who was glad to see you ? Yet , Fanny , do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas , though I certainly did hate him for many a week . No , I do him justice now . He is just what the head of such a family should be . Nay , in sober sadness , I believe I now love you all . \u201d And having said so , with a degree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her before , and now thought only too becoming , she turned away for a moment to recover herself . \u201c I have had a little fit since I came into this room , as you may perceive , \u201d said she presently , with a playful smile , \u201c but it is over now ; so let us sit down and be comfortable ; for as to scolding you , Fanny , which I came fully intending to do , I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point . \u201d And embracing her very affectionately , \u201c Good , gentle Fanny ! when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long , I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you . \u201d Fanny was affected . She had not foreseen anything of this , and her feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word \u201c last . \u201d She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she possibly could ; and Miss Crawford , yet farther softened by the sight of such emotion , hung about her with fondness , and said , \u201c I hate to leave you . I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going . Who says we shall not be sisters ? I know we shall . I feel that we are born to be connected ; and those tears convince me that you feel it too , dear Fanny . \u201d Fanny roused herself , and replying only in part , said , \u201c But you are only going from one set of friends to another . You are going to a very particular friend . \u201d \u201c Yes , very true . Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years . But I have not the least inclination to go near her . I can think only of the friends I am leaving : my excellent sister , yourself , and the Bertrams in general . You have all so much more _ heart _ among you than one finds in the world at large . You all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you , which in common intercourse one knows nothing of . I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter , a much better time for the visit , but now I can not put her off . And when I have done with her I must go to her sister , Lady Stornaway , because _ she _ was rather my most particular friend of the two , but I have not cared much for _ her _ these three years . \u201d After this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent , each thoughtful : Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in the world , Mary on something of less philosophic tendency . _ She _ first spoke again . \u201c How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs , and setting off to find my way to the East room , without having an idea whereabouts it was ! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along , and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work ; and then your cousin \u2019s astonishment , when he opened the door , at seeing me here ! To be sure , your uncle \u2019s returning that very evening ! There never was anything quite like it . \u201d Another short fit of abstraction followed , when , shaking it off , she thus attacked her companion . \u201c Why , Fanny , you are absolutely in a reverie . Thinking , I hope , of one who is always thinking of you . Oh ! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town , that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there ! Oh ! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens ; the wonder , the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done ! For as to secrecy , Henry is quite the hero of an old romance , and glories in his chains . You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest . If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . Oh ! she has been trying for him to such a degree . Innocent and quiet as you sit here , you can not have an idea of the _ sensation _ that you will be occasioning , of the curiosity there will be to see you , of the endless questions I shall have to answer ! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth , and how you do your hair , and who makes your shoes . I wish Margaret were married , for my poor friend \u2019s sake , for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people . And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time . We were all delighted . She could not do otherwise than accept him , for he was rich , and she had nothing ; but he turns out ill - tempered and _ exigeant _ , and wants a young woman , a beautiful young woman of five - and - twenty , to be as steady as himself . And my friend does not manage him well ; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it . There is a spirit of irritation which , to say nothing worse , is certainly very ill - bred . In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect . Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister , and a certain consideration for her judgment , which makes one feel there _ is _ attachment ; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers . I shall be at Mansfield for ever , Fanny . My own sister as a wife , Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband , are my standards of perfection . Poor Janet has been sadly taken in , and yet there was nothing improper on her side : she did not run into the match inconsiderately ; there was no want of foresight . She took three days to consider of his proposals , and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having , and especially applied to my late dear aunt , whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance , and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser . This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort . I have not so much to say for my friend Flora , who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway , who has about as much sense , Fanny , as Mr. Rushworth , but much worse - looking , and with a blackguard character . I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong . By the bye , Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out . But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference . But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? No , no , I see you are not . \u201d There was , indeed , so deep a blush over Fanny \u2019s face at that moment as might warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind . \u201c Excellent creature ! I will not tease you . Everything shall take its course . But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies . It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject , some surmises as to what might be . You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power . Was not he devoted to you at the ball ? And then before the ball , the necklace ! Oh ! you received it just as it was meant . You were as conscious as heart could desire . I remember it perfectly . \u201d \u201c Do you mean , then , that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand ? Oh ! Miss Crawford , _ that _ was not fair . \u201d \u201c Knew of it ! It was his own doing entirely , his own thought . I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . \u201d \u201c I will not say , \u201d replied Fanny , \u201c that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first \u2014 indeed , indeed I was . It is as true as that I sit here . And had I had an idea of it , nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace . As to your brother \u2019s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me . I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn . I was quiet , but I was not blind . I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . \u201d \u201c Ah ! I can not deny it . He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies \u2019 affections . I have often scolded him for it , but it is his only fault ; and there is this to be said , that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for . And then , Fanny , the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many ; of having it in one \u2019s power to pay off the debts of one \u2019s sex ! Oh ! I am sure it is not in woman \u2019s nature to refuse such a triumph . \u201d Fanny shook her head . \u201c I can not think well of a man who sports with any woman \u2019s feelings ; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander - by can judge of . \u201d \u201c I do not defend him . I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife \u2019s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to . And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . If any man ever loved a woman for ever , I think Henry will do as much for you . \u201d Fanny could not avoid a faint smile , but had nothing to say . \u201c I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , \u201d continued Mary presently , \u201c than when he had succeeded in getting your brother \u2019s commission . \u201d She had made a sure push at Fanny \u2019s feelings here . \u201c Oh ! yes . How very , very kind of him . \u201d \u201c I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move . The Admiral hates trouble , and scorns asking favours ; and there are so many young men \u2019s claims to be attended to in the same way , that a friendship and energy , not very determined , is easily put by . What a happy creature William must be ! I wish we could see him . \u201d Poor Fanny \u2019s mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its varieties . The recollection of what had been done for William was always the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford ; and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary , who had been first watching her complacently , and then musing on something else , suddenly called her attention by saying : \u201c I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here . And I do take leave , longing for a happy reunion , and trusting that when we meet again , it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve . \u201d A very , very kind embrace , and some agitation of manner , accompanied these words . \u201c I shall see your cousin in town soon : he talks of being there tolerably soon ; and Sir Thomas , I dare say , in the course of the spring ; and your eldest cousin , and the Rushworths , and Julia , I am sure of meeting again and again , and all but you . I have two favours to ask , Fanny : one is your correspondence . You must write to me . And the other , that you will often call on Mrs. Grant , and make her amends for my being gone . \u201d The first , at least , of these favours Fanny would rather not have been asked ; but it was impossible for her to refuse the correspondence ; it was impossible for her even not to accede to it more readily than her own judgment authorised . There was no resisting so much apparent affection . Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond treatment , and from having hitherto known so little of it , she was the more overcome by Miss Crawford \u2019s . Besides , there was gratitude towards her , for having made their _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ so much less painful than her fears had predicted . It was over , and she had escaped without reproaches and without detection . Her secret was still her own ; and while that was the case , she thought she could resign herself to almost everything . In the evening there was another parting . Henry Crawford came and sat some time with them ; and her spirits not being previously in the strongest state , her heart was softened for a while towards him , because he really seemed to feel . Quite unlike his usual self , he scarcely said anything . He was evidently oppressed , and Fanny must grieve for him , though hoping she might never see him again till he were the husband of some other woman . When it came to the moment of parting , he would take her hand , he would not be denied it ; he said nothing , however , or nothing that she heard , and when he had left the room , she was better pleased that such a token of friendship had passed . On the morrow the Crawfords were gone .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Edmund"}, {"position": [4, 5], "text": "himself"}, {"position": [25, 26], "text": "he"}, {"position":
