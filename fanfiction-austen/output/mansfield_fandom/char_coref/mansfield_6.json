{"document": "VI Mr. Bertram set off for \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 , and Miss Crawford was prepared to find a great chasm in their society , and to miss him decidedly in the meetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families ; and on their all dining together at the Park soon after his going , she retook her chosen place near the bottom of the table , fully expecting to feel a most melancholy difference in the change of masters . It would be a very flat business , she was sure . In comparison with his brother , Edmund would have nothing to say . The soup would be sent round in a most spiritless manner , wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling , and the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any former haunch , or a single entertaining story , about \u201c my friend such a one . \u201d She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper end of the table , and in observing Mr. Rushworth , who was now making his appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords \u2019 arrival . He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county , and that friend having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver , Mr. Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject , and very eager to be improving his own place in the same way ; and though not saying much to the purpose , could talk of nothing else . The subject had been already handled in the drawing - room ; it was revived in the dining - parlour . Miss Bertram \u2019s attention and opinion was evidently his chief aim ; and though her deportment showed rather conscious superiority than any solicitude to oblige him , the mention of Sotherton Court , and the ideas attached to it , gave her a feeling of complacency , which prevented her from being very ungracious . \u201c I wish you could see Compton , \u201d said he ; \u201c it is the most complete thing ! I never saw a place so altered in my life . I told Smith I did not know where I was . The approach _ now _ , is one of the finest things in the country : you see the house in the most surprising manner . I declare , when I got back to Sotherton yesterday , it looked like a prison \u2014 quite a dismal old prison . \u201d \u201c Oh , for shame ! \u201d cried Mrs. Norris . \u201c A prison indeed ? Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world . \u201d \u201c It wants improvement , ma\u2019am , beyond anything . I never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life ; and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done with it . \u201d \u201c No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present , \u201d said Mrs. Grant to Mrs. Norris , with a smile ; \u201c but depend upon it , Sotherton will have _ every _ improvement in time which his heart can desire . \u201d \u201c I must try to do something with it , \u201d said Mr. Rushworth , \u201c but I do not know what . I hope I shall have some good friend to help me . \u201d \u201c Your best friend upon such an occasion , \u201d said Miss Bertram calmly , \u201c would be Mr. Repton , I imagine . \u201d \u201c That is what I was thinking of . As he has done so well by Smith , I think I had better have him at once . His terms are five guineas a day . \u201d \u201c Well , and if they were _ ten _ , \u201d cried Mrs. Norris , \u201c I am sure _ you _ need not regard it . The expense need not be any impediment . If I were you , I should not think of the expense . I would have everything done in the best style , and made as nice as possible . Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that taste and money can do . You have space to work upon there , and grounds that will well reward you . For my own part , if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton , I should be always planting and improving , for naturally I am excessively fond of it . It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now , with my little half acre . It would be quite a burlesque . But if I had more room , I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting . We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage : we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it . You young ones do not remember much about it , perhaps ; but if dear Sir Thomas were here , he could tell you what improvements we made : and a great deal more would have been done , but for poor Mr. Norris \u2019s sad state of health . He could hardly ever get out , poor man , to enjoy anything , and _ that _ disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of . If it had not been for _ that _ , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as Dr. Grant has done . We were always doing something as it was . It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris \u2019s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall , which is now grown such a noble tree , and getting to such perfection , sir , \u201d addressing herself then to Dr. Grant . \u201c The tree thrives well , beyond a doubt , madam , \u201d replied Dr. Grant . \u201c The soil is good ; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering . \u201d \u201c Sir , it is a Moor Park , we bought it as a Moor Park , and it cost us \u2014 that is , it was a present from Sir Thomas , but I saw the bill \u2014 and I know it cost seven shillings , and was charged as a Moor Park . \u201d \u201c You were imposed on , ma\u2019am , \u201d replied Dr. Grant : \u201c these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree . It is an insipid fruit at the best ; but a good apricot is eatable , which none from my garden are . \u201d \u201c The truth is , ma\u2019am , \u201d said Mrs. Grant , pretending to whisper across the table to Mrs. Norris , \u201c that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is : he is scarcely ever indulged with one , for it is so valuable a fruit ; with a little assistance , and ours is such a remarkably large , fair sort , that what with early tarts and preserves , my cook contrives to get them all . \u201d Mrs. Norris , who had begun to redden , was appeased ; and , for a little while , other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton . Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends ; their acquaintance had begun in dilapidations , and their habits were totally dissimilar . After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again . \u201c Smith \u2019s place is the admiration of all the country ; and it was a mere nothing before Repton took it in hand . I think I shall have Repton . \u201d \u201c Mr. Rushworth , \u201d said Lady Bertram , \u201c if I were you , I would have a very pretty shrubbery . One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather . \u201d Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence , and tried to make out something complimentary ; but , between his submission to _ her _ taste , and his having always intended the same himself , with the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies in general , and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was anxious to please , he grew puzzled , and Edmund was glad to put an end to his speech by a proposal of wine . Mr. Rushworth , however , though not usually a great talker , had still more to say on the subject next his heart . \u201c Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds , which is little enough , and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved . Now , at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred , without reckoning the water meadows ; so that I think , if so much could be done at Compton , we need not despair . There have been two or three fine old trees cut down , that grew too near the house , and it opens the prospect amazingly , which makes me think that Repton , or anybody of that sort , would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down : the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill , you know , \u201d turning to Miss Bertram particularly as he spoke . But Miss Bertram thought it most becoming to reply \u2014 \u201c The avenue ! Oh ! I do not recollect it . I really know very little of Sotherton . \u201d Fanny , who was sitting on the other side of Edmund , exactly opposite Miss Crawford , and who had been attentively listening , now looked at him , and said in a low voice \u2014 \u201c Cut down an avenue ! What a pity ! Does it not make you think of Cowper ? \u2018 Ye fallen avenues , once more I mourn your fate unmerited . \u2019 \u201d He smiled as he answered , \u201c I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance , Fanny . \u201d \u201c I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down , to see the place as it is now , in its old state ; but I do not suppose I shall . \u201d \u201c Have you never been there ? No , you never can ; and , unluckily , it is out of distance for a ride . I wish we could contrive it . \u201d \u201c Oh ! it does not signify . Whenever I do see it , you will tell me how it has been altered . \u201d \u201c I collect , \u201d said Miss Crawford , \u201c that Sotherton is an old place , and a place of some grandeur . In any particular style of building ? \u201d \u201c The house was built in Elizabeth \u2019s time , and is a large , regular , brick building ; heavy , but respectable looking , and has many good rooms . It is ill placed . It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park ; in that respect , unfavourable for improvement . But the woods are fine , and there is a stream , which , I dare say , might be made a good deal of . Mr. Rushworth is quite right , I think , in meaning to give it a modern dress , and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well . \u201d Miss Crawford listened with submission , and said to herself , \u201c He is a well - bred man ; he makes the best of it . \u201d \u201c I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth , \u201d he continued ; \u201c but , had I a place to new fashion , I should not put myself into the hands of an improver . I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty , of my own choice , and acquired progressively . I would rather abide by my own blunders than by his . \u201d \u201c _ You _ would know what you were about , of course ; but that would not suit _ me _ . I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters , but as they are before me ; and had I a place of my own in the country , I should be most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it , and give me as much beauty as he could for my money ; and I should never look at it till it was complete . \u201d \u201c It would be delightful to _ me _ to see the progress of it all , \u201d said Fanny . \u201c Ay , you have been brought up to it . It was no part of my education ; and the only dose I ever had , being administered by not the first favourite in the world , has made me consider improvements _ in _ _ hand _ as the greatest of nuisances . Three years ago the Admiral , my honoured uncle , bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in ; and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures ; but it being excessively pretty , it was soon found necessary to be improved , and for three months we were all dirt and confusion , without a gravel walk to step on , or a bench fit for use . I would have everything as complete as possible in the country , shrubberies and flower - gardens , and rustic seats innumerable : but it must all be done without my care . Henry is different ; he loves to be doing . \u201d Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford , whom he was much disposed to admire , speak so freely of her uncle . It did not suit his sense of propriety , and he was silenced , till induced by further smiles and liveliness to put the matter by for the present . \u201c Mr. Bertram , \u201d said she , \u201c I have tidings of my harp at last . I am assured that it is safe at Northampton ; and there it has probably been these ten days , in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary . \u201d Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise . \u201c The truth is , that our inquiries were too direct ; we sent a servant , we went ourselves : this will not do seventy miles from London ; but this morning we heard of it in the right way . It was seen by some farmer , and he told the miller , and the miller told the butcher , and the butcher \u2019s son - in - law left word at the shop . \u201d \u201c I am very glad that you have heard of it , by whatever means , and hope there will be no further delay . \u201d \u201c I am to have it to - morrow ; but how do you think it is to be conveyed ? Not by a wagon or cart : oh no ! nothing of that kind could be hired in the village . I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow . \u201d \u201c You would find it difficult , I dare say , just now , in the middle of a very late hay harvest , to hire a horse and cart ? \u201d \u201c I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it ! To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible , so I told my maid to speak for one directly ; and as I can not look out of my dressing - closet without seeing one farmyard , nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another , I thought it would be only ask and have , and was rather grieved that I could not give the advantage to all . Guess my surprise , when I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable , most impossible thing in the world ; had offended all the farmers , all the labourers , all the hay in the parish ! As for Dr. Grant \u2019s bailiff , I believe I had better keep out of _ his _ way ; and my brother - in - law himself , who is all kindness in general , looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at . \u201d \u201c You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before ; but when you _ do _ think of it , you must see the importance of getting in the grass . The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose : our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out ; but , in harvest , it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse . \u201d \u201c I shall understand all your ways in time ; but , coming down with the true London maxim , that everything is to be got with money , I was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs . However , I am to have my harp fetched to - morrow . Henry , who is good - nature itself , has offered to fetch it in his barouche . Will it not be honourably conveyed ? \u201d Edmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument , and hoped to be soon allowed to hear her . Fanny had never heard the harp at all , and wished for it very much . \u201c I shall be most happy to play to you both , \u201d said Miss Crawford ; \u201c at least as long as you can like to listen : probably much longer , for I dearly love music myself , and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off , for she is gratified in more ways than one . Now , Mr. Bertram , if you write to your brother , I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come : he heard so much of my misery about it . And you may say , if you please , that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return , in compassion to his feelings , as I know his horse will lose . \u201d \u201c If I write , I will say whatever you wish me ; but I do not , at present , foresee any occasion for writing . \u201d \u201c No , I dare say , nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth , would you ever write to him , nor he to you , if it could be helped . The occasion would never be foreseen . What strange creatures brothers are ! You would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world ; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill , or such a relation dead , it is done in the fewest possible words . You have but one style among you . I know it perfectly . Henry , who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be , who loves me , consults me , confides in me , and will talk to me by the hour together , has never yet turned the page in a letter ; and very often it is nothing more than\u2014\u2018Dear Mary , I am just arrived . Bath seems full , and everything as usual . Yours sincerely . \u2019 That is the true manly style ; that is a complete brother \u2019s letter . \u201d \u201c When they are at a distance from all their family , \u201d said Fanny , colouring for William \u2019s sake , \u201c they can write long letters . \u201d \u201c Miss Price has a brother at sea , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us . \u201d \u201c At sea , has she ? In the king \u2019s service , of course ? \u201d Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story , but his determined silence obliged her to relate her brother \u2019s situation : her voice was animated in speaking of his profession , and the foreign stations he had been on ; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been absent without tears in her eyes . Miss Crawford civilly wished him an early promotion . \u201c Do you know anything of my cousin \u2019s captain ? \u201d said Edmund ; \u201c Captain Marshall ? You have a large acquaintance in the navy , I conclude ? \u201d \u201c Among admirals , large enough ; but , \u201d with an air of grandeur , \u201c we know very little of the inferior ranks . Post - captains may be very good sort of men , but they do not belong to _ us _ . Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal : of them and their flags , and the gradation of their pay , and their bickerings and jealousies . But , in general , I can assure you that they are all passed over , and all very ill used . Certainly , my home at my uncle \u2019s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals . Of _ Rears _ and _ Vices _ I saw enough . Now do not be suspecting me of a pun , I entreat . \u201d Edmund again felt grave , and only replied , \u201c It is a noble profession . \u201d \u201c Yes , the profession is well enough under two circumstances : if it make the fortune , and there be discretion in spending it ; but , in short , it is not a favourite profession of mine . It has never worn an amiable form to _ me _ . \u201d Edmund reverted to the harp , and was again very happy in the prospect of hearing her play . The subject of improving grounds , meanwhile , was still under consideration among the others ; and Mrs. Grant could not help addressing her brother , though it was calling his attention from Miss Julia Bertram . \u201c My dear Henry , have _ you _ nothing to say ? You have been an improver yourself , and from what I hear of Everingham , it may vie with any place in England . Its natural beauties , I am sure , are great . Everingham , as it _ used _ to be , was perfect in my estimation : such a happy fall of ground , and such timber ! What would I not give to see it again ! \u201d \u201c Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it , \u201d was his answer ; \u201c but I fear there would be some disappointment : you would not find it equal to your present ideas . In extent , it is a mere nothing ; you would be surprised at its insignificance ; and , as for improvement , there was very little for me to do \u2014 too little : I should like to have been busy much longer . \u201d \u201c You are fond of the sort of thing ? \u201d said Julia . \u201c Excessively ; but what with the natural advantages of the ground , which pointed out , even to a very young eye , what little remained to be done , and my own consequent resolutions , I had not been of age three months before Everingham was all that it is now . My plan was laid at Westminster , a little altered , perhaps , at Cambridge , and at one - and - twenty executed . I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him . I have been a devourer of my own . \u201d \u201c Those who see quickly , will resolve quickly , and act quickly , \u201d said Julia . \u201c _ You _ can never want employment . Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth , you should assist him with your opinion . \u201d Mrs. Grant , hearing the latter part of this speech , enforced it warmly , persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother \u2019s ; and as Miss Bertram caught at the idea likewise , and gave it her full support , declaring that , in her opinion , it was infinitely better to consult with friends and disinterested advisers , than immediately to throw the business into the hands of a professional man , Mr. Rushworth was very ready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford \u2019s assistance ; and Mr. Crawford , after properly depreciating his own abilities , was quite at his service in any way that could be useful . Mr. Rushworth then began to propose Mr. Crawford \u2019s doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton , and taking a bed there ; when Mrs. Norris , as if reading in her two nieces \u2019 minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr. Crawford away , interposed with an amendment . \u201c There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford \u2019s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ? Why should not we make a little party ? Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford \u2019s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _ their _ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and then we could all return to a late dinner here , or dine at Sotherton , just as might be most agreeable to your mother , and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight . I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you . \u201d Lady Bertram made no objection ; and every one concerned in the going was forward in expressing their ready concurrence , excepting Edmund , who heard it all and said nothing .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position":
