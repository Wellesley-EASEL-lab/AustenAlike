{"document": "XLIII It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back , to London , on the morrow , for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price \u2019s ; and two days afterwards , it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from his sister , opened and read by her , on another account , with the most anxious curiosity : \u2014 \u201c I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect . This , as well as I understand , is to be the substance of my information . He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love . I have not time for writing much , but it would be out of place if I had , for this is to be a mere letter of business , penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information , which could not be delayed without risk of evil . My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you ! You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . I have no news for you . You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time . I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin \u2019s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long ago ; suffice it , that everything was just as it ought to be , in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness , and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit . My friend , Mrs. Fraser , is mad for such a house , and it would not make _ me _ miserable . I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter ; she seems in high spirits , and very happy . I fancy Lord S. is very good - humoured and pleasant in his own family , and I do not think him so very ill - looking as I did \u2014 at least , one sees many worse . He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund . Of the last - mentioned hero , what shall I say ? If I avoided his name entirely , it would look suspicious . I will say , then , that we have seen him two or three times , and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance . Mrs. Fraser ( no bad judge ) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person , height , and air ; and I must confess , when he dined here the other day , there were none to compare with him , and we were a party of sixteen . Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales , but \u2014 but \u2014 but Yours affectionately . \u201d \u201c I had almost forgot ( it was Edmund \u2019s fault : he gets into my head more than does me good ) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself \u2014 I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire . My dear little creature , do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks . Those vile sea - breezes are the ruin of beauty and health . My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea , which the Admiral of course never believed , but I know it was so . I am at your service and Henry \u2019s , at an hour \u2019s notice . I should like the scheme , and we would make a little circuit , and shew you Everingham in our way , and perhaps you would not mind passing through London , and seeing the inside of St. George \u2019s , Hanover Square . Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time : I should not like to be tempted . What a long letter ! one word more . Henry , I find , has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that _ you _ approve ; but this can not possibly be permitted before the middle of next week ; that is , he can not anyhow be spared till after the 14th , for _ we _ have a party that evening . The value of a man like Henry , on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable . He will see the Rushworths , which I own I am not sorry for \u2014 having a little curiosity , and so I think has he \u2014 though he will not acknowledge it . \u201d This was a letter to be run through eagerly , to be read deliberately , to supply matter for much reflection , and to leave everything in greater suspense than ever . The only certainty to be drawn from it was , that nothing decisive had yet taken place . Edmund had not yet spoken . How Miss Crawford really felt , how she meant to act , or might act without or against her meaning ; whether his importance to her were quite what it had been before the last separation ; whether , if lessened , it were likely to lessen more , or to recover itself , were subjects for endless conjecture , and to be thought of on that day and many days to come , without producing any conclusion . The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford , after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits , would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up . She would try to be more ambitious than her heart would allow . She would hesitate , she would tease , she would condition , she would require a great deal , but she would finally accept . This was Fanny \u2019s most frequent expectation . A house in town \u2014 that , she thought , must be impossible . Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford might not ask . The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse . The woman who could speak of him , and speak only of his appearance ! What an unworthy attachment ! To be deriving support from the commendations of Mrs. Fraser ! _ She _ who had known him intimately half a year ! Fanny was ashamed of her . Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr. Crawford and herself , touched her , in comparison , slightly . Whether Mr. Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no concern of hers , though , everything considered , she thought he _ would _ go without delay . That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth , was all in her worst line of conduct , and grossly unkind and ill - judged ; but she hoped _ he _ would not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity . He acknowledged no such inducement , and his sister ought to have given him credit for better feelings than her own . She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving this than she had been before ; and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether , by what had come , and what might come , that her usual readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended . She could not command her attention as she wished . If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin , she thought it very likely , most likely , that he would write to her at all events ; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness ; and till she got rid of this idea , till it gradually wore off , by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more , she was in a most restless , anxious state . At length , a something like composure succeeded . Suspense must be submitted to , and must not be allowed to wear her out , and make her useless . Time did something , her own exertions something more , and she resumed her attentions to Susan , and again awakened the same interest in them . Susan was growing very fond of her , and though without any of the early delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny , with a disposition much less inclined to sedentary pursuits , or to information for information \u2019s sake , she had so strong a desire of not _ appearing _ ignorant , as , with a good clear understanding , made her a most attentive , profitable , thankful pupil . Fanny was her oracle . Fanny \u2019s explanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay , or every chapter of history . What Fanny told her of former times dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith ; and she paid her sister the compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author . The early habit of reading was wanting . Their conversations , however , were not always on subjects so high as history or morals . Others had their hour ; and of lesser matters , none returned so often , or remained so long between them , as Mansfield Park , a description of the people , the manners , the amusements , the ways of Mansfield Park . Susan , who had an innate taste for the genteel and well - appointed , was eager to hear , and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme . She hoped it was not wrong ; though , after a time , Susan \u2019s very great admiration of everything said or done in her uncle \u2019s house , and earnest longing to go into Northamptonshire , seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified . Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister ; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this , she began to feel that when her own release from Portsmouth came , her happiness would have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind . That a girl so capable of being made everything good should be left in such hands , distressed her more and more . Were _ she _ likely to have a home to invite her to , what a blessing it would be ! And had it been possible for her to return Mr. Crawford \u2019s regard , the probability of his being very far from objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her own comforts . She thought he was really good - tempered , and could fancy his entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [5, 7], "text": "Mr. Crawford"},
