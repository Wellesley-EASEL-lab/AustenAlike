He is a most extraordinary young man , and whatever be the event , you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character ; though , young as you are , and little acquainted with the transient , varying , unsteady nature of love , as it generally exists , you can not be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement . With him it is entirely a matter of feeling : he claims no merit in it ; perhaps is entitled to none . Yet , having chosen so well , his constancy has a respectable stamp .
