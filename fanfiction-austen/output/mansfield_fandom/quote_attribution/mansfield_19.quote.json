Why do not I see my little Fanny?\u201d\u2014and on perceiving her , came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her , calling her his dear Fanny , kissing her affectionately , and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown ! Fanny knew not how to feel , nor where to look . She was quite oppressed . He had never been so kind , so _ very _ kind to her in his life . His manner seemed changed , his voice was quick from the agitation of joy ; and all that had been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness . He led her nearer the light and looked at her again \u2014 inquired particularly after her health , and then , correcting himself , observed that he need not inquire , for her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point . A fine blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face , he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty . He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him . Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party , who at his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire . He had the best right to be the talker ; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house , in the centre of his family , after such a separation , made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree ; and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage , and answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put . His business in Antigua had latterly been prosperously rapid , and he came directly from Liverpool , having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel , instead of waiting for the packet ; and all the little particulars of his proceedings and events , his arrivals and departures , were most promptly delivered , as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him \u2014 interrupting himself more than once , however , to remark on his good fortune in finding them all at home \u2014 coming unexpectedly as he did \u2014 all collected together exactly as he could have wished , but dared not depend on . Mr. Rushworth was not forgotten : a most friendly reception and warmth of hand - shaking had already met him , and with pointed attention he was now included in the objects most intimately connected with Mansfield . There was nothing disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth \u2019s appearance , and Sir Thomas was liking him already . By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken , unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife , who was really extremely happy to see him , and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years . She had been _ almost _ fluttered for a few minutes , and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away her work , move Pug from her side , and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband . She had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _ her _ pleasure : her own time had been irreproachably spent during his absence : she had done a great deal of carpet - work , and made many yards of fringe ; and she would have answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the young people as for her own . It was so agreeable to her to see him again , and hear him talk , to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives , that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she must have missed him , and how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened absence . Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister . Not that _ she _ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas \u2019s disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known , for her judgment had been so blinded that , except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth \u2019s pink satin cloak as her brother - in - law entered , she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm ; but she was vexed by the _ manner _ of his return . It had left her nothing to do . Instead of being sent for out of the room , and seeing him first , and having to spread the happy news through the house , Sir Thomas , with a very reasonable dependence , perhaps , on the nerves of his wife and children , had sought no confidant but the butler , and had been following him almost instantaneously into the drawing - room . Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended , whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded ; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about , and labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and silence . Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat , she might have gone to the housekeeper with troublesome directions , and insulted the footmen with injunctions of despatch ; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner : he would take nothing , nothing till tea came \u2014 he would rather wait for tea . Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different ; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England , when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height , she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup . \u201c Sure , my dear Sir Thomas , a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea .
