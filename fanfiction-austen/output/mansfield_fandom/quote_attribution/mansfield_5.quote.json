A girl not out has always the same sort of dress : a close bonnet , for instance ; looks very demure , and never says a word . You may smile , but it is so , I assure you ; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far , it is all very proper . Girls should be quiet and modest . The most objectionable part is , that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden . They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite \u2014 to confidence ! _ That _ is the faulty part of the present system .

When Anderson first introduced me to his family , about two years ago , his sister was not _ out _ , and I could not get her to speak to me . I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson , with only her and a little girl or two in the room , the governess being sick or run away , and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business , and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady \u2014 nothing like a civil answer \u2014 she screwed up her mouth , and turned from me with such an air !

I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong . They looked just the same : both well - dressed , with veils and parasols like other girls ; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not _ out _ , and had most excessively offended the eldest .
