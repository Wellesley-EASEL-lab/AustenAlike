What can equal the folly of our two relations ? \u2019 I could not answer , but I believe my looks spoke . She felt reproved . Sometimes how quick to feel ! With a graver look and voice she then added , \u2018 I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister \u2019s expense . \u2019 So she began , but how she went on , Fanny , is not fit , is hardly fit to be repeated to you . I can not recall all her words . I would not dwell upon them if I could . Their substance was great anger at the _ folly _ of each . She reprobated her brother \u2019s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear . Guess what I must have felt . To hear the woman whom \u2014 no harsher name than folly given ! So voluntarily , so freely , so coolly to canvass it ! No reluctance , no horror , no feminine , shall I say , no modest loathings ? This is what the world does . For where , Fanny , shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed ? Spoilt , spoilt ! \u201d"}, {"position": [3021, 3137], "text": "I will tell you everything , and then have done for ever . She saw it only as folly , and that folly stamped only by exposure .

But she has always done justice to you . \u2018 He has thrown away , \u2019 said she , \u2018 such a woman as he will never see again . She would have fixed him ; she would have made him happy for ever . \u2019 My dearest Fanny , I am giving you , I hope , more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been \u2014 but what never can be now . You do not wish me to be silent ? If you do , give me but a look , a word , and I have done . \u201d"}, {"position": [3329, 3333], "text": "Thank God , \u201d"}, {"position": [3337, 3513], "text": "We were all disposed to wonder , but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer . She spoke of you with high praise and warm affection ; yet , even here , there was alloy , a dash of evil ; for in the midst of it she could exclaim , \u2018 Why would not she have him ? It is all her fault . Simple girl ! I shall never forgive her . Had she accepted him as she ought , they might now have been on the point of marriage , and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object . He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again . It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation , in yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham . \u2019 Could you have believed it possible ? But the charm is broken . My eyes are opened . \u201d"}, {"position": [3548, 3748], "text": "Cruelty , do you call it ? We differ there . No , hers is not a cruel nature . I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings . The evil lies yet deeper : in her total ignorance , unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings ; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did . She was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak , as she imagined everybody else would speak . Hers are not faults of temper . She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one , and though I may deceive myself , I can not but think that for me , for my feelings , she would\u2014. Hers are faults of principle , Fanny ; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted , vitiated mind . Perhaps it is best for me , since it leaves me so little to regret . Not so , however . Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her , rather than have to think of her as I do .

Fanny he must give up . I do not think that even _ he _ could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp , and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty . My influence , which is not small shall all go that way ; and when once married , and properly supported by her own family , people of respectability as they are , she may recover her footing in society to a certain degree . In some circles , we know , she would never be admitted , but with good dinners , and large parties , there will always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance ; and there is , undoubtedly , more liberality and candour on those points than formerly . What I advise is , that your father be quiet . Do not let him injure his own cause by interference . Persuade him to let things take their course . If by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave Henry \u2019s protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him . I know how he is likely to be influenced . Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion , and it may all end well ; but if he get his daughter away , it will be destroying the chief hold . \u2019 \u201d"}, {"position": [4164, 4169], "text": "Now , Fanny , \u201d"}, {"position": [4173, 4995], "text": "I shall soon have done . I have told you the substance of all that she said . As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it . That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now . And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . She was astonished , exceedingly astonished \u2014 more than astonished . I saw her change countenance . She turned extremely red . I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it . She would have laughed if she could . It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , \u2018 A pretty good lecture , upon my word . Was it part of your last sermon ? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . \u2019 She tried to speak carelessly , but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . \u2018 Mr. Bertram , \u2019 said she . I looked back . \u2018 Mr. Bertram , \u2019 said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! Equally in brother and sister deceived ! I thank you for your patience , Fanny . This has been the greatest relief , and now we will have done . \u201d"}], "Fanny": [{"position": [3141, 3145], "text": "And what , \u201d"}, {"position": [3156, 3162], "text": "what could you say ? \u201d"}, {"position": [3514, 3517], "text": "Cruel ! \u201d"}, {"position": [3521, 3547], "text": "quite cruel .
