I do not know what to do . This acting scheme gets worse and worse , you see . They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could , and now , to complete the business , are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us . This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first . I know no harm of Charles Maddox ; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable , the _ more _ than intimacy \u2014 the familiarity .

Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger . She has a right to be felt for , because she evidently feels for herself . I heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger ; and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations \u2014 perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be \u2014 it would be ungenerous , it would be really wrong to expose her to it .
