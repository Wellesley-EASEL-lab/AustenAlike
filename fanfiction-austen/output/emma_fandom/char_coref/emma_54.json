{"document": "XVIII Time passed on . A few more to - morrows , and the party from London would be arriving . It was an alarming change ; and Emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when Mr. Knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by . After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with , \" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news . \" \" Good or bad ? \" said she , quickly , looking up in his face . \" I do not know which it ought to be called . \" \" Oh ! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance . You are trying not to smile . \" \" I am afraid , \" said he , composing his features , \" I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . \" \" Indeed ! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too . \" \" There is one subject , \" he replied , \" I hope but one , on which we do not think alike . \" He paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face . \" Does nothing occur to you?-- Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith . \" Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what . \" Have you heard from her yourself this morning ? \" cried he . \" You have , I believe , and know the whole . \" \" No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me . \" \" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin . \" Emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared-- and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , \" No , this is impossible ! \" but her lips were closed . \" It is so , indeed , \" continued Mr. Knightley ; \" I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . \" She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . \" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject . \" \" You mistake me , you quite mistake me , \" she replied , exerting herself . \" It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I can not believe it . It seems an impossibility!--You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin . You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet . You only mean , that he intends it . \" \" I mean that he has done it , \" answered Mr. Knightley , with smiling but determined decision , \" and been accepted . \" \" Good God ! \" she cried.--\"Well!\" --Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , \" Well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me . How , where , when?--Let me know it all . I never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , I assure you.--How -- how has it been possible ? \" \" It is a very simple story . He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley 's . They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley 's . The party was to be our brother and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith . My friend Robert could not resist . They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving . He came down by yesterday 's coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own . This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when . Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman 's language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only in the great.--However , I must say , that Robert Martin 's heart seemed for _ him _ , and to _ me _ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley 's , my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy . \" He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply . To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness . She must wait a moment , or he would think her mad . Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added , \" Emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected . His situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more . His good sense and good principles would delight you.--As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands . His rank in society I would alter if I could , which is saying a great deal I assure you , Emma.--You laugh at me about William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin . \" He wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering , \" You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match . I think Harriet is doing extremely well . _ Her _ connexions may be worse than _ his _ . In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are . I have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize . You can not imagine how suddenly it has come on me ! how peculiarly unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before . \" \" You ought to know your friend best , \" replied Mr. Knightley ; \" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her . \" Emma could not help laughing as she answered , \" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?--It was not Harriet 's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox . \" The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma 's feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet 's side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , \" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin , \" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature . It could not be otherwise . \" Do you dare say this ? \" cried Mr. Knightley . \" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of?-- What do you deserve ? \" \" Oh ! I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer . Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are ? \" \" I am quite sure , \" he replied , speaking very distinctly , \" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so . He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do . He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends . Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs. Goddard ? I assured him that I could not . Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day . \" \" I am perfectly satisfied , \" replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , \" and most sincerely wish them happy . \" \" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before . \" \" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool . \" \" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet 's good qualities . I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin 's sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever , ) to get acquainted with her . I have often talked to her a good deal . You must have seen that I did . Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for . \" \" Me ! \" cried Emma , shaking her head.--\"Ah ! poor Harriet ! \" She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved . Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father . She was not sorry . She wanted to be alone . Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected . She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational . Her father 's business was to announce James 's being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing . The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet 's welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.--What had she to wish for ? Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own . Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future . Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . She must laugh at such a close ! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! Such a heart -- such a Harriet ! Now there would be pleasure in her returning -- Every thing would be a pleasure . It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin . High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over . The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over . She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty . In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed . They arrived.--Mrs . Weston was alone in the drawing - room:-- but hardly had they been told of the baby , and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window . \" It is Frank and Miss Fairfax , \" said Mrs. Weston . \" I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning . He stays till to - morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in , I hope . \" In half a minute they were in the room . Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side . They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure . When Mr. Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation-- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say , \" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston 's letters . I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . I hope you do not retract what you then said . \" \" No , indeed , \" cried Emma , most happy to begin , \" not in the least . I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person . \" He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness . \" Is not she looking well ? \" said he , turning his eyes towards Jane . \" Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her . \" But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . \" I can never think of it , \" she cried , \" without extreme shame . \" \" The shame , \" he answered , \" is all mine , or ought to be . But is it possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late . Early , I know , you had none . \" \" I never had the smallest , I assure you . \" \" That appears quite wonderful . I was once very near -- and I wish I had-- it would have been better . But though I was always doing wrong things , they were very bad wrong things , and such as did me no service.-- It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing . \" \" It is not now worth a regret , \" said Emma . \" I have some hope , \" resumed he , \" of my uncle 's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her . When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward.--But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . Do not you pity me ? \" Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , \" Ah ! by the bye , \" then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment--\"I hope Mr. Knightley is well ? \" He paused.--She coloured and laughed.--\"I know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour . Let me return your congratulations.-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I can not presume to praise . \" Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were , \" Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness ! such delicacy!-- and yet without being actually fair.--One can not call her fair . It is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair-- a most distinguishing complexion ! So peculiarly the lady in it.-- Just colour enough for beauty . \" \" I have always admired her complexion , \" replied Emma , archly ; \" but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?-- When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten ? \" \" Oh ! no -- what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare-- \" But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying , \" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.-- I am sure it was a consolation to you . \" \" Oh ! no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ? I was the most miserable wretch ! \" \" Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth . I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation . I think there is a little likeness between us . \" He bowed . \" If not in our dispositions , \" she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , \" there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own . \" \" True , true , \" he answered , warmly . \" No , not true on your side . You can have no superior , but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel . Look at her . Is not she an angel in every gesture ? Observe the turn of her throat . Observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father.-- You will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt 's jewels . They are to be new set . I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head . Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ? \" \" Very beautiful , indeed , \" replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , \" How delighted I am to see you again ! and to see you in such excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world . I should certainly have called at Hartfield , had you failed to come . \" The others had been talking of the child , Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant 's appearing not quite well . She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry . Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again . This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it . \" She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment . She could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too often . It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it . \" Frank Churchill caught the name . \" Perry ! \" said he to Emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax 's eye . \" My friend Mr. Perry ! What are they saying about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage ? \" Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane 's countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf . \" Such an extraordinary dream of mine ! \" he cried . \" I can never think of it without laughing.--She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse . I see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown . Look at her . Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye-- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ? \" Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice , \" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me!-- They _ will _ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them ! \" He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character . The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [28, 29], "text":
