{"document": "XVIII \" I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you , \" said Mr. Weston . Mrs. Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously . \" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , \" he continued-- \" and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name . \" \" Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage . \" \" You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure.-- He is to be in town next week , if not sooner . We have notice of it in a letter to - day . I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son 's hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs. Weston . She is his principal correspondent , I assure you . I hardly ever get a letter . \" \" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! Oh ! Mr. Weston-- ( laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.--Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh ! Mr. Weston , I could not have believed it of you ! \" \" Aye , we men are sad fellows . You must take care of yourself , Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs. Churchill 's account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her-- so they are all to move southward without loss of time . \" \" Indeed!--from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in Yorkshire ? \" \" Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London . a considerable journey . \" \" Yes , upon my word , very considerable . Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London . But what is distance , Mr. Weston , to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr. Suckling , sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me-- but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses . \" \" The evil of the distance from Enscombe , \" said Mr. Weston , \" is , that Mrs. Churchill , _ as _ _ we _ _ understand _ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . In Frank 's last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle 's ! This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word . Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs. Elton . You must grant me that . \" \" No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing . I Always take the part of my own sex . I do indeed . I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always stand up for women-- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill 's making incredible exertions to avoid it . Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety . She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . Does Mrs. Churchill do the same ? \" \" Depend upon it , Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for\"-- Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with , \" Oh ! Mr. Weston , do not mistake me . Selina is no fine lady , I assure you . Do not run away with such an idea . \" \" Is not she ? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld . \" Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly . It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _ not _ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr. Weston went on . \" Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect-- but this is quite between ourselves . She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her . Besides , she is out of health now ; but _ that _ indeed , by her own account , she has always been . I would not say so to every body , Mrs. Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill 's illness . \" \" If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr. Weston?--To Bath , or to Clifton ? \" \" She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her . The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe . She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change . It is a retired place . A fine place , but very retired . \" \" Aye -- like Maple Grove , I dare say . Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove . Such an immense plantation all round it ! You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement.-- And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life . I always say a woman can not have too many resources -- and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society . \" \" Frank was here in February for a fortnight . \" \" So I remember to have heard . He will find an _ addition _ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition . But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world . \" This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by , and Mr. Weston , with a very good grace , immediately exclaimed , \" My dear madam ! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible . Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston 's letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton . \" He had done his duty and could return to his son . \" When Frank left us , \" continued he , \" it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day 's news doubly welcome . It has been completely unexpected . That is , _ I _ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me . He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ` How could he contrive to come ? And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ? ' and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see . I have observed , Mrs. Elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next . \" \" Very true , Mr. Weston , perfectly true . It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _ May _ before Hymen 's saffron robe would be put on for us . Oh ! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views ! The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair . \" She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr. Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on . \" You were mentioning May . May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe -- in short , to spend in London ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring-- precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise . When he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in February , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . Now will be the time . This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs. Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . I think it is so . I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight . I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy . He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy . Mrs. Weston 's partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me . She thinks nobody equal to him . \" \" And I assure you , Mr. Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others . I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer . \" Mr. Weston was musing . \" I hope , \" said he presently , \" I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill . If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish . You can not be ignorant , Mrs. Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . She was the instigator . Frank 's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . Mr. Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife 's : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence ! And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart . \" \" Only think ! well , that must be infinitely provoking ! I have quite a horror of upstarts . Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves ! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly . People of the name of Tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families . A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows . They came from Birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , Mr. Weston . One has not great hopes from Birmingham . I always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans , though a good many things I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , Mr. Suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours . It is infinitely too bad . Mr. Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him -- I believe , at least -- I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his death . \" They were interrupted . Tea was carrying round , and Mr. Weston , having said all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of walking away . After tea , Mr. and Mrs. Weston , and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse to cards . The remaining five were left to their own powers , and Emma doubted their getting on very well ; for Mr. Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent . Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother . He was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with-- \" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister 's letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her 's , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them . \" \" I rather hope to satisfy you both , \" said Emma , \" for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . \" \" And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again . \" \" That is very likely . You think so , do not you ? \" \" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father-- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . \" \" Increase ! \" \" Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life . \" \" Difference ! No indeed I am not . \" \" There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . Witness this very time . Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party!-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ? Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it . A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr. Cole 's , or balls at the Crown . The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great . \" \" Yes , \" said his brother quickly , \" it is Randalls that does it all . \" \" Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way . And if they are , I only beg you to send them home . \" \" No , \" cried Mr. Knightley , \" that need not be the consequence . Let them be sent to Donwell . I shall certainly be at leisure . \" \" Upon my word , \" exclaimed Emma , \" you amuse me ! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . These amazing engagements of mine-- what have they been ? Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . But you , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I can not imagine . And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one-- and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . \" Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs. Elton 's beginning to talk to him .
