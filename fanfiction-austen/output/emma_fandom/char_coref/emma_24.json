{"document": "VI The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again . He came with Mrs. Weston , to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially . He had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on Highbury.--\"He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . \" -- Highbury , with Mrs. Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him . They walked thither directly . Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr. Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm . She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend . If he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it . But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied . It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection . And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . They were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse 's ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed . Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings . He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father 's father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good - will towards Highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with . Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him justice . Their first pause was at the Crown Inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place . He was immediately interested . Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased . He saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested . No , it was long enough , broad enough , handsome enough . It would hold the very number for comfort . They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter . Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury ! The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied . He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body 's returning into their proper place the next morning . He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing ; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills . He seemed to have all the life and spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe . Of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind . He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap . It was but an effusion of lively spirits . At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it . \" Yes , oh ! yes\"--he replied ; \" I was just going to mention it . A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour . The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before . \" \" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? \" \" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ? Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.-- A most deplorable want of complexion . \" Emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax 's complexion . \" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face . \" He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health . Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . \" Well , \" said Emma , \" there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion . \" He shook his head and laughed.--\"I can not separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion . \" \" Did you see her often at Weymouth ? Were you often in the same society ? \" At this moment they were approaching Ford 's , and he hastily exclaimed , \" Ha ! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me . He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford 's . If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury . I must buy something at Ford 's . It will be taking out my freedom.-- I dare say they sell gloves . \" \" Oh ! yes , gloves and every thing . I do admire your patriotism . You will be adored in Highbury . You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr. Weston 's son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford 's , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues . \" They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of \" Men 's Beavers \" and \" York Tan \" were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said--\"But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _ amor _ _ patriae _ . Do not let me lose it . I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life . \" \" I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth . \" \" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one . It is always the lady 's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance . Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow . \" \" Upon my word ! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself . But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her . \" \" May I , indeed?--Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well . I met her frequently at Weymouth . I had known the Campbells a little in town ; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set . Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs. Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman . I like them all . \" \" You know Miss Fairfax 's situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? \" \" Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do . \" \" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , \" said Mrs. Weston smiling ; \" remember that I am here.--Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life . I will move a little farther off . \" \" I certainly do forget to think of _ her _ , \" said Emma , \" as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . \" He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment . When the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , \" Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? \" said Frank Churchill . \" Ever hear her ! \" repeated Emma . \" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury . I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . She plays charmingly . \" \" You think so , do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge . She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself.-- I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body 's performance.--I have been used to hear her 's admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage-- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other . That , I thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof . \" \" Proof indeed ! \" said Emma , highly amused.--\"Mr . Dixon is very musical , is he ? We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . \" \" Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof . \" \" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _ I _ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me . I could not excuse a man 's having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ? \" \" It was her very particular friend , you know . \" \" Poor comfort ! \" said Emma , laughing . \" One would rather have a stranger preferred than one 's very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself!-- Poor Mrs. Dixon ! Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland . \" \" You are right . It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it . \" \" So much the better -- or so much the worse:--I do not know which . But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself . She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . \" \" As to that -- I do not-- \" \" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax 's sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself . But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon , one may guess what one chuses . \" \" There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all-- \" he began rather quickly , but checking himself , added , \" however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were-- how it might all be behind the scenes . I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be . \" \" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . But we never did . I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved . \" \" It is a most repulsive quality , indeed , \" said he . \" Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing . There is safety in reserve , but no attraction . One can not love a reserved person . \" \" Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body 's reserve to procure one . Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question . I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . \" He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected . His ideas seemed more moderate-- his feelings warmer . She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton 's house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with . No , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having . If it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house . There must be ample room in it for every real comfort . The man must be a blockhead who wanted more . Mrs. Weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about . Used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size , he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one . But Emma , in her own mind , determined that he _ did _ know what he was talking about , and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life , and to marry , from worthy motives . He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper 's room , or a bad butler 's pantry , but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy , and that whenever he were attached , he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [5, 8], "text": "Mr. Frank
