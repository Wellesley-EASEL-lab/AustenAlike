{"document": "I A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill . She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him . Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing . If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary . She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his . She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration . That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance ! and yet , she could not help rather anticipating something decisive . She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state . It was not very long , though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill 's feelings . The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards . He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act . They met with the utmost friendliness . There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her . But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree . She watched him well . It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been . Absence , with the conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very natural and very desirable effect . He was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever , and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit , and recur to old stories : and he was not without agitation . It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference . He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him . Lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury . \" He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed-- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off . \" She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long . This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days . He was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented . His aunt could not bear to have him leave her . Such was his own account at Randall 's . If he were quite sincere , if he really tried to come , it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill 's removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder . That she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls . Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago . He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father 's doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever . It soon appeared that London was not the place for her . She could not endure its noise . Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering ; and by the ten days ' end , her nephew 's letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan . They were going to remove immediately to Richmond . Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there , and had otherwise a fancy for the place . A ready - furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged , and much benefit expected from the change . Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends-- for the house was taken for May and June . She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish . Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects . He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered . She hoped it was not so . Two months must bring it to the proof . Mr. Weston 's own happiness was indisputable . He was quite delighted . It was the very circumstance he could have wished for . Now , it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood . What were nine miles to a young man?--An hour 's ride . He would be always coming over . The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never . Sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to Manchester - street -- was a serious obstacle . Were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning . There was no comfort in having him in London ; he might as well be at Enscombe ; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse . Better than nearer ! One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,-- the ball at the Crown . It had not been forgotten before , but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day . Now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond , a few lines from Frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible . Mr. Weston 's ball was to be a real thing . A very few to - morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness . Mr. Woodhouse was resigned . The time of year lightened the evil to him . May was better for every thing than February . Mrs. Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield , James had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them , while dear Emma were gone .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [10, 11], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [16, 17], "text": "her"}, {"position": [26, 27], "text": "She"}, {"position": [35, 36],
