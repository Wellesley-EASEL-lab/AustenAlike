{"document": "XII Mr. Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr. Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella 's first day . Emma 's sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation . She hoped they might now become friends again . She thought it was time to make up . Making - up indeed would not do . _ She _ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _ he _ would never own that he had . Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt 's arms . It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity . Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby , \" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces . As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree . \" \" If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike . \" \" To be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong . \" \" Yes , \" said he , smiling--\"and reason good . I was sixteen years old when you were born . \" \" A material difference then , \" she replied--\"and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ? \" \" Yes -- a good deal _ nearer _ . \" \" But still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently . \" \" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child . Come , my dear Emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it . Tell your aunt , little Emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now . \" \" That 's true , \" she cried--\"very true . Little Emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt . Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited . Now , Mr. Knightley , a word or two more , and I have done . As far as good intentions went , we were _ both _ right , and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong . I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very , very bitterly disappointed . \" \" A man can not be more so , \" was his short , full answer . \" Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come , shake hands with me . \" This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and \" How d'ye do , George ? \" and \" John , how are you ? \" succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong . The plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by John , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness . While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter . \" My poor dear Isabella , \" said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children--\"How long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! And how tired you must be after your journey ! You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together . My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel . \" Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and two basins only were ordered . After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection , \" It was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here . I never had much opinion of the sea air . \" \" Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir -- or we should not have gone . He recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little Bella 's throat,-- both sea air and bathing . \" \" Ah ! my dear , but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , I have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps I never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body . I am sure it almost killed me once . \" \" Come , come , \" cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , \" I must beg you not to talk of the sea . It makes me envious and miserable;-- I who have never seen it ! South End is prohibited , if you please . My dear Isabella , I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet ; and he never forgets you . \" \" Oh ! good Mr. Perry -- how is he , sir ? \" \" Why , pretty well ; but not quite well . Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country . I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere . But then there is not so clever a man any where . \" \" And Mrs. Perry and the children , how are they ? do the children grow ? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry . I hope he will be calling soon . He will be so pleased to see my little ones . \" \" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence . And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella 's throat . \" \" Oh ! my dear sir , her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it . Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield 's , which we have been applying at times ever since August . \" \" It is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation , I would have spoken to-- \" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates , \" said Emma , \" I have not heard one inquiry after them . \" \" Oh ! the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters . I hope they are quite well . Good old Mrs. Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.-- And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!-- How are they , sir ? \" \" Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole . But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago . \" \" How sorry I am ! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza . \" \" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November . Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season . \" \" No , I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _ very _ sickly except-- \" Ah ! my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season . Nobody is healthy in London , nobody can be . It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there ! so far off!-- and the air so bad ! \" \" No , indeed--_we _ are not at all in a bad air . Our part of London is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir . The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest . We are so very airy ! I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _ we _ are so remarkably airy!--Mr . Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air . \" \" Ah ! my dear , it is not like Hartfield . You make the best of it-- but after you have been a week at Hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same . Now I can not say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present . \" \" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming . I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case . I trust , at least , that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill , \" turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband . \" Middling , my dear ; I can not compliment you . I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well . \" \" What is the matter , sir?--Did you speak to me ? \" cried Mr. John Knightley , hearing his own name . \" I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued . I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left home . \" \" My dear Isabella,\"--exclaimed he hastily--\"pray do not concern yourself about my looks . Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as I chuse . \" \" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother , \" cried Emma , \" about your friend Mr. Graham 's intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate . What will it answer ? Will not the old prejudice be too strong ? \" And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella 's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising . \" That sweet , amiable Jane Fairfax ! \" said Mrs. John Knightley.-- \" It is so long since I have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town ! What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them ! I always regret excessively on dear Emma 's account that she can not be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all . She would be such a delightful companion for Emma . \" Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , \" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person . You will like Harriet . Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet . \" \" I am most happy to hear it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma 's age . \" This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation . The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments-- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable;--but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin . Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable . Here was a dangerous opening . \" Ah ! \" said Mr. Woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma 's ear expressed , \" Ah ! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End . It does not bear talking of . \" And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel . After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with , \" I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here . \" \" But why should you be sorry , sir?--I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good . \" \" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End . South End is an unhealthy place . Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End . \" \" I know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and I am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly . \" \" You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere.-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places . A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air . And , by what I understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable . You should have consulted Perry . \" \" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey;--only consider how great it would have been.--An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty . \" \" Ah ! my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air . This is just what Perry said . It seemed to him a very ill - judged measure . \" Emma 's attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law 's breaking out . \" Mr. Perry , \" said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , \" would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for . Why does he make it any business of his , to wonder at what I do?-- at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed , I hope , the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.-- I want his directions no more than his drugs . \" He paused-- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , \" If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself . \" \" True , true , \" cried Mr. Knightley , with most ready interposition-- \" very true . That 's a consideration indeed.--But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I can not conceive any difficulty . I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . \" Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Mr. Knightley"},
