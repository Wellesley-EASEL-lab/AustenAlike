{"document": "IX Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her , but Emma could not quarrel with herself . He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven . She was sorry , but could not repent . On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days . The Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton 's return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for Harriet 's feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted . Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin 's being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views of improving her little friend 's mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow . It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet 's fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies . In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon . Miss Nash , head - teacher at Mrs. Goddard 's , had written out at least three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with Miss Woodhouse 's help , to get a great many more . Emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity . Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in . \" So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them ! but he hoped he should in time . \" And it always ended in \" Kitty , a fair but frozen maid . \" His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter . It was by no means his daughter 's wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition . Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well - known charade , My first doth affliction denote , Which my second is destin'd to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal.-- made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already . \" Why will not you write one yourself for us , Mr. Elton ? \" said she ; \" that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you . \" \" Oh no ! he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life . The stupidest fellow ! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse\"--he stopt a moment--\"or Miss Smith could inspire him . \" The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own . \" I do not offer it for Miss Smith 's collection , \" said he . \" Being my friend 's , I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it . \" The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand . There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend 's . He was gone the next moment:--after another moment 's pause , \" Take it , \" said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet--\"it is for you . Take your own . \" But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself . To Miss-- CHARADE . My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . Another view of man , my second brings , Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! But ah ! united , what reverse we have ! Man 's boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye ! She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , \" Very well , Mr. Elton , very well indeed . I have read worse charades . _ Courtship_--a very good hint . I give you credit for it . This is feeling your way . This is saying very plainly--`Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you . Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance . ' May its approval beam in that soft eye ! Harriet exactly . Soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets , the justest that could be given . Thy ready wit the word will soon supply . Humph -- Harriet 's ready wit ! All the better . A man must be very much in love , indeed , to describe her so . Ah ! Mr. Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you . For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken . An excellent charade indeed ! and very much to the purpose . Things must come to a crisis soon now . She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet 's wondering questions . \" What can it be , Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be ? I have not an idea -- I can not guess it in the least . What can it possibly be ? Do try to find it out , Miss Woodhouse . Do help me . I never saw any thing so hard . Is it kingdom ? I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady . Do you think it is a good one ? Can it be woman ? And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . Can it be Neptune ? Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! Or a trident ? or a mermaid ? or a shark ? Oh , no ! shark is only one syllable . It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ? \" \" Mermaids and sharks ! Nonsense ! My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ? Give me the paper and listen . For Miss ---------- , read Miss Smith . My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . That is _ court _ . Another view of man , my second brings ; Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! That is _ ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream . But ah ! united , ( _ courtship _ , you know , ) what reverse we have ! Man 's boasted power and freedom , all are flown . Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you can not find much difficulty in comprehending . Read it in comfort to yourself . There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you . \" Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion . She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness . She could not speak . But she was not wanted to speak . It was enough for her to feel . Emma spoke for her . \" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment , \" said she , \" that I can not have a doubt as to Mr. Elton 's intentions . You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it . I thought it must be so . I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you . Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened . I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural . Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other ! I am very happy . I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart . This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . This is a connexion which offers nothing but good . It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us . \" \" Dear Miss Woodhouse!\" --and \" Dear Miss Woodhouse , \" was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought . Mr. Elton 's superiority had very ample acknowledgment . \" Whatever you say is always right , \" cried Harriet , \" and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it . It is so much beyond any thing I deserve . Mr. Elton , who might marry any body ! There can not be two opinions about _ him _ . He is so very superior . Only think of those sweet verses--`To Miss -------- . ' Dear me , how clever!--Could it really be meant for me ? \" \" I can not make a question , or listen to a question about that . It is a certainty . Receive it on my judgment . It is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter - of - fact prose . \" \" It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected . I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take place ! \" \" When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form . You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes . Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls . There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow . The course of true love never did run smooth-- A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage . \" \" That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas ! And he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like Mr. Knightley ! His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week . And so excellent in the Church ! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury . Dear me ! When I look back to the first time I saw him ! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured . And how beautiful we thought he looked ! He was arm - in - arm with Mr. Cole . \" \" This is an alliance which , whoever -- whatever your friends may be , must be agreeable to them , provided at least they have common sense ; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools . If they are anxious to see you _ happily _ married , here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in , here it will be accomplished ; and if their only object is that you should , in the common phrase , be _ well _ married , here is the comfortable fortune , the respectable establishment , the rise in the world which must satisfy them . \" \" Yes , very true . How nicely you talk ; I love to hear you . You understand every thing . You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other . This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it . \" \" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday . \" \" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read . \" \" I never read one more to the purpose , certainly . \" \" It is as long again as almost all we have had before . \" \" I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour . Such things in general can not be too short . \" Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear . The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind . \" It is one thing , \" said she , presently -- her cheeks in a glow--\"to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this . \" Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin 's prose . \" Such sweet lines ! \" continued Harriet--\"these two last!--But how shall I ever be able to return the paper , or say I have found it out?--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what can we do about that ? \" \" Leave it to me . You do nothing . He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming . Trust to me . \" \" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book ! I am sure I have not got one half so good . \" \" Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book . \" \" Oh ! but those two lines are\"-- --\"The best of all . Granted;--for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them . They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them . The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change . But take it away , and all _ appropriation _ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection . Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion . A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither . Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you . \" Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . \" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands , \" said she . \" Very well , \" replied Emma ; \" a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased . But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him . It will be giving him so much pleasure ! He loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment . He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him . \" Harriet looked grave . \" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it . Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration . If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you . Do not let us be too solemn on the business . He has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade . \" \" Oh ! no -- I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it . Do as you please . \" Mr. Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \" Well , my dears , how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh ? \" \" Yes , papa ; we have something to read you , something quite fresh . A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt , we suppose , by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in . \" She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion . \" Aye , that 's very just , indeed , that 's very properly said . Very true . ` Woman , lovely woman . ' It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so prettily , but you , Emma . \" Emma only nodded , and smiled.--After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , \" Ah ! it is no difficulty to see who you take after ! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things ! If I had but her memory ! But I can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; I can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several . Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink'd boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before . And that is all that I can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through . But I think , my dear , you said you had got it . \" \" Yes , papa , it is written out in our second page . We copied it from the Elegant Extracts . It was Garrick 's , you know . \" \" Aye , very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it . Kitty , a fair but frozen maid . The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama . I hope we shall have her here next week . Have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children ? \" \" Oh ! yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual , you know . Why should there be any change ? \" \" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here!--not since last Easter , and then only for a few days.--Mr . John Knightley 's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here ! \" \" She will not be surprized , papa , at least . \" \" I do not know , my dear . I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married . \" \" We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here . \" \" Yes , my dear , if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she is coming for only one week . There will not be time for any thing . \" \" It is unfortunate that they can not stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity . Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey . Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us . \" \" It would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield . \" Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley 's claims on his brother , or any body 's claims on Isabella , except his own . He sat musing a little while , and then said , \" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . She and the children might stay very well . \" \" Ah ! papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will . Isabella can not bear to stay behind her husband . \" This was too true for contradiction . Unwelcome as it was , Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter 's attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them . \" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here . I am sure she will be pleased with the children . We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ? I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ? \" \" Aye , I wonder which she will . Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come . They are very fond of being at Hartfield , Harriet . \" \" I dare say they are , sir . I am sure I do not know who is not . \" \" Henry is a fine boy , but John is very like his mama . Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father . John , the second , is named after his father . Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her . And he is a very clever boy , indeed . They are all remarkably clever ; and they have so many pretty ways . They will come and stand by my chair , and say , ` Grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ? ' and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas . I think their father is too rough with them very often . \" \" He appears rough to you , \" said Emma , \" because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father . The children are all fond of him . \" \" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way ! \" \" But they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much . It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other . \" \" Well , I can not understand it . \" \" That is the case with us all , papa . One half of the world can not understand the pleasures of the other . \" Later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again . Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up . His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse 's party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield . If he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come . Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber . He re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it-- \" Oh ! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it . We admired it so much , that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith 's collection . Your friend will not take it amiss I hope . Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines . \" Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say . He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about \" honour,\"--glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively . With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said , \" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two . He may be sure of every woman 's approbation while he writes with such gallantry . \" \" I have no hesitation in saying , \" replied Mr. Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; \" I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _ I _ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _ I _ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ) , he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life . \" After this speech he was gone as soon as possible . Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet 's share .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [6, 7], "text": "her"}, {"position": [9, 10],
