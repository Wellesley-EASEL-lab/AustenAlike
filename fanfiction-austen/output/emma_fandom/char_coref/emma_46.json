{"document": "X One morning , about ten days after Mrs. Churchill 's decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston , who \" could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her . \" -- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , \" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do , if it be possible . Mrs. Weston wants to see you . She must see you . \" \" Is she unwell ? \" \" No , no , not at all -- only a little agitated . She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _ alone _ , and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come ? \" \" Certainly . This moment , if you please . It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way . But what can be the matter?-- Is she really not ill ? \" \" Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions . You will know it all in time . The most unaccountable business ! But hush , hush ! \" To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma . Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls . \" Now,\"--said Emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,-- \" now Mr. Weston , do let me know what has happened . \" \" No , no,\"--he gravely replied.--\"Don't ask me . I promised my wife to leave it all to her . She will break it to you better than I can . Do not be impatient , Emma ; it will all come out too soon . \" \" Break it to me , \" cried Emma , standing still with terror.-- \" Good God!--Mr . Weston , tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick Square . I know it has . Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is . \" \" No , indeed you are mistaken . \"-- \" Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square . Which of them is it?-- I charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment . \" \" Upon my word , Emma . \" -- \" Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ? Good Heavens!--What can be to be _ broke _ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ? \" \" Upon my honour , \" said he very seriously , \" it does not . It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley . \" Emma 's courage returned , and she walked on . \" I was wrong , \" he continued , \" in talking of its being _ broke _ to you . I should not have used the expression . In fact , it does not concern you-- it concerns only myself,--that is , we hope.--Humph!--In short , my dear Emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it . I do n't say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but things might be much worse.--If we walk fast , we shall soon be at Randalls . \" Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort . She asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward . Her fancy was very active . Half a dozen natural children , perhaps -- and poor Frank cut off!-- This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her . It inspired little more than an animating curiosity . \" Who is that gentleman on horseback ? \" said she , as they proceeded-- speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view . \" I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank , I assure you . You will not see him . He is half way to Windsor by this time . \" \" Has your son been with you , then ? \" \" Oh ! yes -- did not you know?--Well , well , never mind . \" For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure , \" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did . \" They hurried on , and were speedily at Randalls.--\"Well , my dear , \" said he , as they entered the room--\"I have brought her , and now I hope you will soon be better . I shall leave you together . There is no use in delay . I shall not be far off , if you want me . \" -- And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room,--\"I have been as good as my word . She has not the least idea . \" Mrs. Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma 's uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said , \" What is it my dear friend ? Something of a very unpleasant nature , I find , has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is . I have been walking all this way in complete suspense . We both abhor suspense . Do not let mine continue longer . It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be . \" \" Have you indeed no idea ? \" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice . \" Can not you , my dear Emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ? \" \" So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill , I do guess . \" \" You are right . It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ; \" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up . ) \" He has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand . It is impossible to express our surprize . He came to speak to his father on a subject,--to announce an attachment-- \" She stopped to breathe . Emma thought first of herself , and then of Harriet . \" More than an attachment , indeed , \" resumed Mrs. Weston ; \" an engagement-- a positive engagement.--What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;--nay , that they have been long engaged ! \" Emma even jumped with surprize;--and , horror - struck , exclaimed , \" Jane Fairfax!--Good God ! You are not serious ? You do not mean it ? \" \" You may well be amazed , \" returned Mrs. Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover-- \" You may well be amazed . But it is even so . There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October -- formed at Weymouth , and kept a secret from every body . Not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the Campbells , nor her family , nor his.-- It is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself . I can hardly believe it.-- I thought I knew him . \" Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation . \" Well , \" said she at last , trying to recover herself ; \" this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day , before I can at all comprehend it . What!--engaged to her all the winter-- before either of them came to Highbury ? \" \" Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me , Emma , very much . It has hurt his father equally . _ Some _ _ part _ of his conduct we can not excuse . \" Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , \" I will not pretend _ not _ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of . \" Mrs. Weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but Emma 's countenance was as steady as her words . \" That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference , \" she continued , \" I will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when I did like him , when I was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder . Fortunately , however , it did cease . I have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him . You may believe me , Mrs. Weston . This is the simple truth . \" Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do . \" Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself , \" said she . \" On this point we have been wretched . It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so.-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account . \" \" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself . But this does not acquit _ him _ , Mrs. Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame . What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _ very _ disengaged ? What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed . \" \" From something that he said , my dear Emma , I rather imagine-- \" \" And how could _ she _ bear such behaviour ! Composure with a witness ! to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity , which I can neither comprehend nor respect . \" \" There were misunderstandings between them , Emma ; he said so expressly . He had not time to enter into much explanation . He was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay-- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said . The present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct . \" \" Impropriety ! Oh ! Mrs. Weston -- it is too calm a censure . Much , much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him , I can not say how it has sunk him in my opinion . So unlike what a man should be!-- None of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life . \" \" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and-- \" \" Good God ! \" cried Emma , not attending to her.--\"Mrs . Smallridge , too ! Jane actually on the point of going as governess ! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy ? To suffer her to engage herself-- to suffer her even to think of such a measure ! \" \" He knew nothing about it , Emma . On this article I can fully acquit him . It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans . They burst on him , I do not know how , but by some letter or message-- and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long . \" Emma began to listen better . \" I am to hear from him soon , \" continued Mrs. Weston . \" He told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now . Let us wait , therefore , for this letter . It may bring many extenuations . It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood . Do n't let us be severe , do n't let us be in a hurry to condemn him . Let us have patience . I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may . They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment . \" \" _ His _ sufferings , \" replied Emma dryly , \" do not appear to have done him much harm . Well , and how did Mr. Churchill take it ? \" \" Most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty . Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family ! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required . What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave!-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion . \" \" Ah ! \" thought Emma , \" he would have done as much for Harriet . \" \" This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the light this morning . He stopped at Highbury , at the Bates 's , I fancy , some time -- and then came on hither ; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle , to whom he is just now more necessary than ever , that , as I tell you , he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.-- He was very much agitated -- very much , indeed -- to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In addition to all the rest , there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell , which he had had no previous suspicion of-- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal . \" \" And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells , the Dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ? \" Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush . \" None ; not one . He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves . \" \" Well , \" said Emma , \" I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and I wish them very happy . But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding . What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage , and treachery?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable ! \" \" I am quite easy on that head , \" replied Mrs. Weston . \" I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard . \" \" You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady . \" \" True . But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax , I never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there I must have been safe . \" At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch . His wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , \" Now , dearest Emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match . Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour . It is not a connexion to gratify ; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that , why should we ? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for Frank , I mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for-- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right . And how much may be said in her situation for even that error ! \" \" Much , indeed ! \" cried Emma feelingly . \" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their 's , nor the world 's law . ' \" She met Mr. Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming , \" A very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word ! This was a device , I suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing . But you really frightened me . I thought you had lost half your property , at least . And here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate you , Mr. Weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter . \" A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate . His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 10],
