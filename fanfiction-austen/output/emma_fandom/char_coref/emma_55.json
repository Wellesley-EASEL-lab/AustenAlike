{"document": "XIX If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was!-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness . Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend 's approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.-- Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley 's , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight . But what did such particulars explain?-- The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma . The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet 's parentage became known . She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed . No objection was raised on the father 's side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . She had no doubt of Harriet 's happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself . Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted.-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner . Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them , could impair.--Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married . Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November . The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight 's absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan.--John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it . But Mr. Woodhouse -- how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent?--he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event . When first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless.--A second allusion , indeed , gave less pain.-- He began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it-- a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation . Still , however , he was not happy . Nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter 's courage failed . She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could not proceed . In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse 's mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way.-- Mrs. Weston 's poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys-- evidently by the ingenuity of man . Other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _ housebreaking _ to Mr. Woodhouse 's fears.--He was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law 's protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life . The strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence . While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe.-- But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November . The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr. Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse . The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs. Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own.--\"Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it . \" --But , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union .
