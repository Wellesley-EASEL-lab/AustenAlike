{"document": "VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet 's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton 's being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet 's side , as there could be any occasion for . She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton 's being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . She had no scruple with regard to him . He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet 's manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . \" You have given Miss Smith all that she required , \" said he ; \" you have made her graceful and easy . She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature . \" \" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints . She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself . I have done very little . \" \" If it were admissible to contradict a lady , \" said the gallant Mr. Elton-- \" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before . \" \" Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me . So much superadded decision of character ! Skilful has been the hand ! \" \" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure . I never met with a disposition more truly amiable . \" \" I have no doubt of it . \" And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover . She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet 's picture . \" Did you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ? \" said she : \" did you ever sit for your picture ? \" Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naivete , \" Oh ! dear , no , never . \" No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed , \" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be ! I would give any money for it . I almost long to attempt her likeness myself . You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general . But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust . But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me . It would be such a delight to have her picture ! \" \" Let me entreat you , \" cried Mr. Elton ; \" it would indeed be a delight ! Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend . I know what your drawings are . How could you suppose me ignorant ? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ? \" Yes , good man!--thought Emma -- but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ? You know nothing of drawing . Do n't pretend to be in raptures about mine . Keep your raptures for Harriet 's face . \" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr. Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do . Harriet 's features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch . \" \" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success . Pray , pray attempt it . As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession . \" \" But I am afraid , Mr. Elton , Harriet will not like to sit . She thinks so little of her own beauty . Did not you observe her manner of answering me ? How completely it meant , ` why should my picture be drawn ? ' \" \" Oh ! yes , I observed it , I assure you . It was not lost on me . But still I can not imagine she would not be persuaded . \" Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others . Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet . Her many beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn . She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to . She played and sang;--and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of . She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . There was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same . They were both in ecstasies . A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse 's performances must be capital . \" No great variety of faces for you , \" said Emma . \" I had only my own family to study from . There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore . Mrs. Weston again , and again , and again , you see . Dear Mrs. Weston ! always my kindest friend on every occasion . She would sit whenever I asked her . There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike . I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . Then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children;--there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama 's children ever were . Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby . I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see . He had nestled down his head most conveniently . That 's very like . I am rather proud of little George . The corner of the sofa is very good . Then here is my last,\"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length--\"my last and my best -- my brother , Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished , when I put it away in a pet , and vowed I would never take another likeness . I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs . Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _ very _ like)--only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella 's cold approbation of--\"Yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice . \" We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all . It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again . But for Harriet 's sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _ at _ _ present _ , I will break my resolution now . \" Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , \" No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe . Exactly so . No husbands and wives , \" with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once . But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer . She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait . It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr. John Knightley 's , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist . But there was no doing any thing , with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch . She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere . It then occurred to her to employ him in reading . \" If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed ! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith 's . \" Mr. Elton was only too happy . Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace . She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day 's sketch to wish to go on . There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton 's very promising attachment was likely to add . Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr. Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again . \" By all means . We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party . \" The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy . Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism . \" Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,\"--observed Mrs. Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.--\"The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes . It is the fault of her face that she has them not . \" \" Do you think so ? \" replied he . \" I can not agree with you . It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature . I never saw such a likeness in my life . We must allow for the effect of shade , you know . \" \" You have made her too tall , Emma , \" said Mr. Knightley . Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr. Elton warmly added , \" Oh no ! certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall . Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know . Proportions , fore - shortening.--Oh no ! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith 's . Exactly so indeed ! \" \" It is very pretty , \" said Mr. Woodhouse . \" So prettily done ! Just as your drawings always are , my dear . I do not know any body who draws so well as you do . The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold . \" \" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer . Look at the tree . \" \" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear . \" \" You , sir , may say any thing , \" cried Mr. Elton , \" but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit ! Any other situation would have been much less in character . The naivete of Miss Smith 's manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is most admirable ! I can not keep my eyes from it . I never saw such a likeness . \" The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December . But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton , than it was removed . His gallantry was always on the alert . \" Might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it ! he could ride to London at any time . It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand . \" \" He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world,\"--brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled the business . Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough . \" What a precious deposit ! \" said he with a tender sigh , as he received it . \" This man is almost too gallant to be in love , \" thought Emma . \" I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love . He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so , ' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal . I come in for a pretty good share as a second . But it is his gratitude on Harriet 's account . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text": "her"}, {"position": [31, 32], "text": "she"},
