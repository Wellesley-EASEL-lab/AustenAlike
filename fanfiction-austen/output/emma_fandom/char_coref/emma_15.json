{"document": "XV Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation . Mr. Elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in . Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa . He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them . Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles . He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend-- her fair , lovely , amiable friend . \" Did she know?--had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably . \" And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him . But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet's -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _ promise _ _ him _ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . She was vexed . It did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable ! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance , \" Would not she give him her support?--would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection ? He could not be satisfied without a promise-- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ? \" \" So scrupulous for others , \" he continued , \" and yet so careless for herself ! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . Is this fair , Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us . Have not I some right to complain ? I am sure of your kind support and aid . \" Emma saw Mrs. Weston 's surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose . She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse : \" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir . Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow . \" Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer . Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly . \" I admired your resolution very much , sir , \" said he , \" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon . Every body must have seen the snow coming on . I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well . Another hour or two 's snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand . I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight . \" Mr. Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away . As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty . He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . \" What is to be done , my dear Emma?--what is to be done ? \" was Mr. Woodhouse 's first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time . To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little . His eldest daughter 's alarm was equal to his own . The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them . \" You had better order the carriage directly , my love , \" said she ; \" I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk . I am not at all afraid . I should not mind walking half the way . I could change my shoes , you know , the moment I got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold . \" \" Indeed ! \" replied he . \" Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold . Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home , I dare say . It will be bad enough for the horses . \" Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan . Mrs. Weston could only approve . Isabella then went to Emma ; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when Mr. Knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother 's first report of the snow , came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence . He had gone beyond the sweep-- some way along the Highbury road -- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over . He had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend . To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father 's account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls . He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus-- \" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ? \" \" I am ready , if the others are . \" \" Shall I ring the bell ? \" \" Yes , do . \" And the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for . A few minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . \" He was afraid they should have a very bad drive . He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it . And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind . He did not know what they had best do . They must keep as much together as they could ; \" and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage . Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive . It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one . But now , she would rather it had not happened . She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston 's good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense . To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible . It really was so . Without scruple -- without apology-- without much apparent diffidence , Mr. Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _ her _ lover . She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all . Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak . She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour . Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , \" I am very much astonished , Mr. Elton . This to _ me _ ! you forget yourself-- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _ me _ , if you please . \" \" Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!\" -- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness , \" Mr. Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct ! and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner . Command yourself enough to say no more , and I will endeavour to forget it . \" But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects . He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,-- but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer . As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied , \" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer . You have made yourself too clear . Mr. Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express . After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible ! Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions . \" \" Good Heaven ! \" cried Mr. Elton , \" what can be the meaning of this?-- Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend . If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse ! who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near ! No , upon my honour , there is no unsteadiness of character . I have thought only of you . I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else . Every thing that I have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself . You can not really , seriously , doubt it . No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me . \" It would be impossible to say what Emma felt , on hearing this-- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost . She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton 's sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed-- \" Charming Miss Woodhouse ! allow me to interpret this interesting silence . It confesses that you have long understood me . \" \" No , sir , \" cried Emma , \" it confesses no such thing . So far from having long understood you , I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment . As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent . Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her ? \" \" Never , madam , \" cried he , affronted in his turn : \" never , I assure you . _ I _ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled . I wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to -- Every body has their level : but as for myself , I am not , I think , quite so much at a loss . I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received-- \" \" Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend . In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance . I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does . Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of . But , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , I trust , will not be lasting . I have no thoughts of matrimony at present . \" He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield . There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of-- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Mr.
