{"document": "XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister . She had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly . It was a delightful visit;--perfect , in being much too short . In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at Christmas . Mr. Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party . How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter 's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also . Harriet , Mr. Elton , and Mr. Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr. Woodhouse 's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing . The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house . Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls . She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr. Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears . Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs. Goddard 's unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton 's would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard 's door , when she was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together . Emma was just describing the nature of her friend 's complaint;-- \" a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them . \" Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed , \" A sore - throat!--I hope not infectious . I hope not of a putrid infectious sort . Has Perry seen her ? Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend . Let me entreat you to run no risks . Why does not Perry see her ? \" Emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard 's experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject , \" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston . But , upon my word , Mr. Elton , in your case , I should certainly excuse myself . You appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night . \" Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her 's , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;-- but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being \" very cold , certainly very cold , \" and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening . \" You do quite right , \" said she;--\"we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston . \" But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr. Elton 's only objection , and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . It was a done thing ; Mr. Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her . \" Well , \" said she to herself , \" this is most strange!--After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination-- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr. Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he can not refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked . What a strange thing love is ! he can see ready wit in Harriet , but will not dine alone for her . \" Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard 's for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour . After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with-- \" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton . It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned . With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works . \" \" Mr. Elton 's manners are not perfect , \" replied Emma ; \" but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal . Where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority . There is such perfect good - temper and good - will in Mr. Elton as one can not but value . \" \" Yes , \" said Mr. John Knightley presently , with some slyness , \" he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you . \" \" Me ! \" she replied with a smile of astonishment , \" are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton 's object ? \" \" Such an imagination has crossed me , I own , Emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now . \" \" Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea ! \" \" I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly . I think your manners to him encouraging . I speak as a friend , Emma . You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do . \" \" I thank you ; but I assure you you are quite mistaken . Mr. Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ; \" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . He said no more . Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it . The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time . Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour . The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent . \" A man , \" said he , \" must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him . He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing . It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment!-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people 's not staying comfortably at home when they can ! If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man 's house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow . Going in dismal weather , to return probably in worse;--four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle , shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home . \" Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the \" Very true , my love , \" which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence . She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips . They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr. Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly . Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject . Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her . She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , \" Much the same-- not better . \" \" _ My _ report from Mrs. Goddard 's , \" said she presently , \" was not so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better ' was _ my _ answer . \" His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered . \" Oh ! no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard 's door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . Very much grieved and concerned-- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning . \" Emma smiled and answered--\"My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed . Mr. Perry has been with her , as you probably heard . \" \" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not-- \" \" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report . But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness . Such a sad loss to our party to - day ! \" \" Dreadful!--Exactly so , indeed.--She will be missed every moment . \" This was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer . Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment . \" What an excellent device , \" said he , \" the use of a sheepskin for carriages . How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold with such precautions . The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman 's carriage perfectly complete . One is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted . Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence . It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha ! snows a little I see . \" \" Yes , \" said John Knightley , \" and I think we shall have a good deal of it . \" \" Christmas weather , \" observed Mr. Elton . \" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day 's party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence . This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings . At Christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather . I was snowed up at a friend 's house once for a week . Nothing could be pleasanter . I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se'nnight . \" Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly , \" I can not wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls . \" At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton 's spirits for other feelings . Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party . \" We are sure of excellent fires , \" continued he , \" and every thing in the greatest comfort . Charming people , Mr. and Mrs. Weston;-- Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any . Mr. Weston 's dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two . I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma , ) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr. Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings . \" \" I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body . \" \" Indeed ! ( in a tone of wonder and pity , ) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery . Well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment . \" \" My first enjoyment , \" replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , \" will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [12, 15], "text": "Mrs. John Knightley"}, {"position": [28, 29], "text":
