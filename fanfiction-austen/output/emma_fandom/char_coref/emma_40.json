{"document": "IV A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began : \" Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over . \" Emma was a good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak . There was a seriousness in Harriet 's manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary . \" It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish , \" she continued , \" to have no reserves with you on this subject . As I am happily quite an altered creature in _ one _ _ respect _ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me . \" \" Yes , \" said Emma , \" I hope I do . \" \" How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . . \" cried Harriet , warmly . \" It seems like madness ! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him-- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night!--However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil.--No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment 's pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept-- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke).--However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown . Can not you guess what this parcel holds ? \" said she , with a conscious look . \" Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing ? \" \" No -- I can not call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much . \" She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _ Most _ _ precious _ _ treasures _ on the top . Her curiosity was greatly excited . Harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience . Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister . \" Now , \" said Harriet , \" you _ must _ recollect . \" \" No , indeed I do not . \" \" Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat -- just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came-- I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?-- But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it-- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat . \" \" My dearest Harriet ! \" cried Emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , \" you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear . Remember it ? Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!--Oh ! my sins , my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)-- go on -- what else ? \" \" And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally . \" \" And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake ! \" said Emma , recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement . And secretly she added to herself , \" Lord bless me ! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about ! I never was equal to this . \" \" Here , \" resumed Harriet , turning to her box again , \" here is something still more valuable , I mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . \" Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure . It was the end of an old pencil,--the part without any lead . \" This was really his , \" said Harriet.--\"Do not you remember one morning?--no , I dare say you do not . But one morning -- I forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _ that _ _ evening _ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer . Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . \" \" I do remember it , \" cried Emma ; \" I perfectly remember it.-- Talking about spruce - beer.--Oh ! yes -- Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton 's seeming resolved to learn to like it too . I perfectly remember it.--Stop ; Mr. Knightley was standing just here , was not he ? I have an idea he was standing just here . \" \" Ah ! I do not know . I can not recollect.--It is very odd , but I can not recollect.--Mr . Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now . \" -- \" Well , go on . \" \" Oh ! that 's all . I have nothing more to shew you , or to say-- except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it . \" \" My poor dear Harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ? \" \" Yes , simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them . It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them . \" \" But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful . \" \" I shall be happier to burn it , \" replied Harriet . \" It has a disagreeable look to me . I must get rid of every thing.-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . \" \" And when , \" thought Emma , \" will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? \" She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _ told _ no fortune , might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly . Emma was not thinking of it at the moment , which made the information she received more valuable . She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , \" Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so\"--and thought no more of it , till after a minute 's silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , \" I shall never marry . \" Emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment 's debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied , \" Never marry!--This is a new resolution . \" \" It is one that I shall never change , however . \" After another short hesitation , \" I hope it does not proceed from-- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton ? \" \" Mr. Elton indeed ! \" cried Harriet indignantly.--\"Oh ! no\"--and Emma could just catch the words , \" so superior to Mr. Elton ! \" She then took a longer time for consideration . Should she proceed no farther?--should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing?-- Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved.-- She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know . Plain dealing was always best . She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.-- She was decided , and thus spoke-- \" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . Is not it so ? \" \" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially . \" \" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet . The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart . \" \" Service ! oh ! it was such an inexpressible obligation!-- The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time-- when I saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before . Such a change ! In one moment such a change ! From perfect misery to perfect happiness ! \" \" It is very natural . It is natural , and it is honourable.-- Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully.-- But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise . I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet . I do not by any means engage for its being returned . Consider what you are about . Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . Be observant of him . Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations . I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject . I am determined against all interference . Henceforward I know nothing of the matter . Let no name ever pass our lips . We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity . But take care of yourself . I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _ him _ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value . \" Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude . Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend . Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind-- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [12, 13], "text": "Harriet"}, {"position":
