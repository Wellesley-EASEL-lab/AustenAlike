{"document": "XVII When the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself . She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together . Mrs. Elton left them no choice . If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs. Elton 's side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs. Elton 's meditated activity . \" Here is April come ! \" said she , \" I get quite anxious about you . June will soon be here . \" \" But I have never fixed on June or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general . \" \" But have you really heard of nothing ? \" \" I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet . \" \" Oh ! my dear , we can not begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . \" \" I not aware ! \" said Jane , shaking her head ; \" dear Mrs. Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ? \" \" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have . You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _ first _ situations . I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove . A cousin of Mr. Suckling , Mrs. Bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle . Wax - candles in the schoolroom ! You may imagine how desirable ! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge 's is the one I would most wish to see you in . \" \" Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer , \" said Jane . \" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself . But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present . \" \" Trouble ! aye , I know your scruples . You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am . I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible . \" \" Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble . \" \" But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . Your inexperience really amuses me ! A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment 's notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . \" \" Excuse me , ma'am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale-- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect . \" \" Oh ! my dear , human flesh ! You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . \" \" I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade , \" replied Jane ; \" governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies . But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do . \" \" Something that would do ! \" repeated Mrs. Elton . \" Aye , _ that _ may suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life . \" \" You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison . A gentleman 's family is all that I should condition for . \" \" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is -- I do not know-- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play;--yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest . \" \" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , \" said Jane , \" they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs. Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am . \" \" And I am quite serious too , I assure you , \" replied Mrs. Elton gaily , \" in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . \" In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane , \" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!--Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature he is;--I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . But this good old Mr. Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . Oh ! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . How do you like it?--Selina 's choice -- handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery . I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery are every thing . I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . Do you think it will look well ? \" The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing - room when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them . He had returned to a late dinner , and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over . He had been too much expected by the best judges , for surprize-- but there was great joy . Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before . John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man 's house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply . A man who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone!--Such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party . John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , \" I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . \" Mr. Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it . \" Read it , read it , \" said he , \" it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma . \" The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body . \" Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think . Well , what do you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I?--Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me?--In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _ she _ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday . As to her illness , all nothing of course . But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . This is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good news , is not it ? Have you finished it ? Has Emma read it all ? Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . \" Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion . Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them . She was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy . Her congratulations were warm and open ; but Emma could not speak so fluently . _ She _ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable . Mr. Weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already . It was well that he took every body 's joy for granted , or he might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly delighted . They were the first entitled , after Mrs. Weston and Emma , to be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .", "clusters": [{"mentions":
