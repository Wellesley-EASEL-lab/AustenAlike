{"document": "III This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure . It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying . The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet 's infatuation.-- From Harriet 's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes . It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him . The fever was over , and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy . She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational , Frank Churchill not too much in love , and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her ! She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning . He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day . She did not regret it . Having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- Frank Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened . Harriet looked white and frightened , and he was trying to cheer her.-- The iron gates and the front - door were not twenty yards asunder;-- they were all three soon in the hall , and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away . A young lady who faints , must be recovered ; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained . Such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them can not last long . A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole . Miss Smith , and Miss Bickerton , another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the Richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies . A child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and Miss Bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on Harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury . But poor Harriet could not follow . She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless-- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain . How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more . In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent . By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment . The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond Highbury-- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them . The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion . He had left them completely frightened ; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach Hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome . It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : he had thought of no other place . This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of Harriet 's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself . Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way , could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain . So Emma thought , at least . Could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made . It was a very extraordinary thing ! Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more . He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton . It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences . It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other . In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet 's own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms . Every thing was to take its natural course , however , neither impelled nor assisted . She would not stir a step , nor drop a hint . No , she had had enough of interference . There could be no harm in a scheme , a mere passive scheme . It was no more than a wish . Beyond it she would on no account proceed . Emma 's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible . Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury . It was the very event to engage those who talk most , the young and the low ; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news . The last night 's ball seemed lost in the gipsies . Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ) , as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent-- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with . She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message . The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry . The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 9], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [24, 25], "text": "she"}, {"position": [33, 34], "text": "enjoy.--She"},
