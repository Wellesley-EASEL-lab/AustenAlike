{"document": "IV Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations , that a young person , who either marries or dies , is sure of being kindly spoken of . A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins 's name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played . Mr. Elton returned , a very happy man . He had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one . He had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior , of course , to the first , as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost . He came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith . The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity-- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at Mr. Green 's , and the party at Mrs. Brown's -- smiles and blushes rising in importance-- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented . He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant . The wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for Bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole 's did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride . During his present short stay , Emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air . She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again . She wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction . The pain of his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage . Many vain solicitudes would be prevented-- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it . A _ Mrs. _ _ Elton _ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark . It would be almost beginning their life of civility again . Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little . She was good enough for Mr. Elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury-- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by Harriet 's side . As to connexion , there Emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet , he had done nothing . On that article , truth seemed attainable . _ What _ she was , must be uncertain ; but _ who _ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10,000 l. , it did not appear that she was at all Harriet 's superior . She brought no name , no blood , no alliance . Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol-- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained-- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived . Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise . And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _ very _ _ well _ _ married _ , to a gentleman in a _ great _ _ way _ , near Bristol , who kept two carriages ! That was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins . Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all ! She had talked her into love ; but , alas ! she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet 's mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her . Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love . And now , poor girl ! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton . She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other . Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _ just _ to meet with him , or _ just _ to miss him , _ just _ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _ just _ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture . She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins 's happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached!-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love ! Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet 's mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations . Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other . Mr. Elton 's engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin . The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin 's calling at Mrs. Goddard 's a few days afterwards . Harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess . But Mr. Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares . While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin 's visit . How that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary-- and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration . Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude . It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!-- After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet 's returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance . She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future . She could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of Harriet ?", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [40, 42], "text": "Miss Hawkins"}, {"position": [51, 52], "text": "she"}, {"position": [101, 102], "text": "her"}, {"position": [117,
