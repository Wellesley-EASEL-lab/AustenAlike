{"document": "XI Mr. Elton must now be left to himself . It was no longer in Emma 's power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures . The coming of her sister 's family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect-- that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers . They might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no . She hardly wished to have more leisure for them . There are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves . Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest . Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella 's sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit . He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety . The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them . Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible . She could never see a fault in any of them . She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry . They were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance . Mr. John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour . He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased . The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his . He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing . He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law . Nothing wrong in him escaped her . She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself . Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella 's sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father . There he had not always the patience that could have been wished . Mr. Woodhouse 's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed . It did not often happen ; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his father - in - law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for Emma 's charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not . The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality . They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter 's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last . \" Ah , my dear , \" said he , \" poor Miss Taylor -- It is a grievous business . \" \" Oh yes , sir , \" cried she with ready sympathy , \" how you must miss her ! And dear Emma , too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!-- I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well , sir . \" \" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably . \" Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls . \" Oh ! no -- none in the least . I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life-- never looking so well . Papa is only speaking his own regret . \" \" Very much to the honour of both , \" was the handsome reply . \" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ? \" asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father . Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--\"Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish . \" \" Oh ! papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married . Either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston , and generally both , either at Randalls or here -- and as you may suppose , Isabella , most frequently here . They are very , very kind in their visits . Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself . Papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all . Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth . \" \" Just as it should be , \" said Mr. John Knightley , \" and just as I hoped it was from your letters . Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy . I have been always telling you , my love , that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have Emma 's account , I hope you will be satisfied . \" \" Why , to be sure , \" said Mr. Woodhouse--\"yes , certainly -- I can not deny that Mrs. Weston , poor Mrs. Weston , does come and see us pretty often-- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again . \" \" It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not , papa.-- You quite forget poor Mr. Weston . \" \" I think , indeed , \" said John Knightley pleasantly , \" that Mr. Weston has some little claim . You and I , Emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband . I , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force . As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can . \" \" Me , my love , \" cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part.-- \" Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr. Weston , that excellent Mr. Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve . I believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed . Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper . I shall never forget his flying Henry 's kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o'clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor . \" \" Where is the young man ? \" said John Knightley . \" Has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ? \" \" He has not been here yet , \" replied Emma . \" There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and I have not heard him mentioned lately . \" \" But you should tell them of the letter , my dear , \" said her father . \" He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston , to congratulate her , and a very proper , handsome letter it was . She shewed it to me . I thought it very well done of him indeed . Whether it was his own idea you know , one can not tell . He is but young , and his uncle , perhaps-- \" \" My dear papa , he is three - and - twenty . You forget how time passes . \" \" Three - and - twenty!--is he indeed?--Well , I could not have thought it-- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother ! Well , time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad . However , it was an exceeding good , pretty letter , and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure . I remember it was written from Weymouth , and dated Sept. 28th -- and began , ` My dear Madam , ' but I forget how it went on ; and it was signed ` F. C. Weston Churchill . ' -- I remember that perfectly . \" \" How very pleasing and proper of him ! \" cried the good - hearted Mrs. John Knightley . \" I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man . But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father ! There is something so shocking in a child 's being taken away from his parents and natural home ! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him . To give up one 's child ! I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else . \" \" Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills , I fancy , \" observed Mr. John Knightley coolly . \" But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John . Mr. Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords . \" Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass . She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother 's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Mr. Elton"}, {"position": [8, 9], "text": "himself"}, {"position": [20, 21], "text": "his"}, {"position": [24, 25], "text": "his"}, {"position": [279, 280], "text": "He"}, {"position": [299, 300], "text": "his"}, {"position": [320, 321], "text": "his"}, {"position": [391, 392], "text": "his"}], "name": "Mr. Elton"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [15, 16], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [30, 31], "text": "her"}, {"position": [54, 55], "text": "her"}, {"position": [77, 78], "text": "she"}, {"position": [80, 81], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [94, 95], "text": "her"}, {"position": [121, 122], "text": "She"}, {"position": [1001, 1002], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [1213, 1214], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [1548, 1549], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [1650, 1651], "text": "You"}, {"position": [1654, 1655], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [1674, 1675], "text": "you"}, {"position": [1836, 1837], "text": "yourself"}, {"position": [1838, 1839], "text": "your"}, {"position": [1970, 1971], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [1993, 1994], "text": "I"}, {"position": [2066, 2067], "text": "you"}, {"position": [2356, 2357], "text": "you"}, {"position": [2453, 2454], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [2477, 2478], "text": "she"}], "name": "Emma"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [96, 98], "text": "the lovers"}, {"position": [99, 100], "text": "They"}, {"position": [441, 444], "text": "her little ones"}, {"position": [649, 650], "text": "They"}, {"position": [1057, 1058], "text": "They"}, {"position": [1149, 1150], "text": "you"}, {"position": [1157, 1158], "text": "you.--I"}, {"position": [1378, 1379], "text": "They"}, {"position": [1416, 1417], "text": "us"}, {"position": [1457, 1458], "text": "ourselves"}, {"position": [1489, 1490], "text": "your"}, {"position": [1496, 1497], "text": "you"}, {"position": [1521, 1522], "text": "you"}, {"position": [1541, 1542], "text": "you"}, {"position": [1546, 1547], "text": "you"}, {"position": [1554, 1555], "text": "you"}, {"position": [1590, 1591], "text": "us"}, {"position": [1689, 1690], "text": "us"}, {"position": [2331, 2333], "text": "the Churchills"}], "name": "you.--I"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [69, 70], "text": "Hartfield"}, {"position": [192, 193], "text": "Hartfield"}, {"position": [354, 355], "text": "Hartfield"}, {"position": [415, 416], "text": "Hartfield"}, {"position": [1090, 1091], "text": "Hartfield"}, {"position": [1200, 1202], "text": "the place"}, {"position": [1539, 1540], "text": "Hartfield"}, {"position": [1777, 1778], "text": "Hartfield"}], "name": "Hartfield"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [165, 166], "text": "Surry"}, {"position": [232, 233], "text": "Surry"}], "name": "Surry"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [153, 156], "text": "Mrs. John Knightley"}, {"position": [289, 290], "text": "her"}, {"position": [335, 338], "text": "Mrs. John Knightley"}, {"position": [420, 421], "text": "her"}, {"position": [426, 429], "text": "Mrs. John Knightley"}, {"position": [441, 442], "text": "her"}, {"position": [503, 506], "text": "Mrs. John Knightley"}, {"position": [531, 532], "text": "her"}, {"position": [534, 537], "text": "a devoted wife"}, {"position": [547, 548], "text": "her"}, {"position": [567, 568], "text": "She"}, {"position": [578, 579], "text": "She"}, {"position": [595, 596], "text": "her"}, {"position": [598, 599], "text": "she"}, {"position": [609, 610], "text": "her"}, {"position": [619, 620], "text": "her"}, {"position": [634, 635], "text": "her"}, {"position": [641, 642], "text": "her"}, {"position": [781, 782], "text": "her"}, {"position": [797, 798], "text": "she"}, {"position": [821, 828], "text": "his fair sister -
