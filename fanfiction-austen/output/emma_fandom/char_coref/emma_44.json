{"document": "VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma 's thoughts all the evening . How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell . They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed . A whole evening of back - gammon with her father , was felicity to it . _ There _ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach . As a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart . She hoped no one could have said to her , \" How could you be so unfeeling to your father?-- I must , I will tell you truths while I can . \" Miss Bates should never again -- no , never ! If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious . But it should be so no more . In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse . She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit . She had no objection . She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers . Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not . \" The ladies were all at home . \" She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule . There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking . She heard Miss Bates 's voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , \" Well , my dear , I shall _ say _ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough . \" Poor old Mrs. Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . \" I am afraid Jane is not very well , \" said she , \" but I do not know ; they _ tell _ me she is well . I dare say my daughter will be here presently , Miss Woodhouse . I hope you find a chair . I wish Hetty had not gone . I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma'am ? Do you sit where you like ? I am sure she will be here presently . \" Emma seriously hoped she would . She had a moment 's fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her . But Miss Bates soon came--\"Very happy and obliged\"--but Emma 's conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner . A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings . The touch seemed immediate . \" Ah ! Miss Woodhouse , how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard-- and are come to give us joy . This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning:-- such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs. Dixon . ` My dear , ' said I , ` you will blind yourself'-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually . One can not wonder , one can not wonder . It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing her tears)--but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has . When one is in great pain , you know one can not feel any blessing quite as it may deserve . She is as low as possible . To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room-- I want her to lie down upon the bed . ` My dear , ' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed : ' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room . But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well . She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her . You were kept waiting at the door -- I was quite ashamed-- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming . ` It is only Mrs. Cole , ' said I , ` depend upon it . Nobody else would come so early . ' ` Well , ' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now . ' But then Patty came in , and said it was you . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her . '-- ` I can see nobody , ' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were . ` If you must go , my dear , ' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed . ' \" Emma was most sincerely interested . Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself . She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax 's advantage and comfort as possible . \" It must be a severe trial to them all . She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell 's return . \" \" So very kind ! \" replied Miss Bates . \" But you are always kind . \" There was no bearing such an \" always ; \" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of-- \" Where -- may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going ? \" \" To a Mrs. Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children . Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs. Suckling 's own family , and Mrs. Bragge 's ; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove . Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove . \" \" Mrs. Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes-- \" \" Yes , our good Mrs. Elton . The most indefatigable , true friend . She would not take a denial . She would not let Jane say , ` No ; ' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell , ) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell 's return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did . It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane 's answer ; but she positively declared she would _ not _ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go . Quite a surprize to me ! I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge 's situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it till it was all settled . \" \" You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton ? \" \" Yes , all of us ; Mrs. Elton would have us come . It was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley . ` You _ must _ _ all _ spend your evening with us , ' said she--`I positively must have you _ all _ come . ' \" \" Mr. Knightley was there too , was he ? \" \" No , not Mr. Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not;--but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had . Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning 's party . Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I can not say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it . However , _ I _ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it . \" \" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ? \" \" I dare say she had . \" \" Whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- I mean , as to the character and manners of the family . \" \" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse . Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it . Except the Sucklings and Bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all Mrs. Elton 's acquaintance . Mrs. Smallridge , a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove -- and as to the children , except the little Sucklings and little Bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere . Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!-- It will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure.--And her salary!-- I really can not venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse . Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane . \" \" Ah ! madam , \" cried Emma , \" if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned . \" \" You are so noble in your ideas ! \" \" And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you ? \" \" Very soon , very soon , indeed ; that 's the worst of it . Within a fortnight . Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry . My poor mother does not know how to bear it . So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma'am , do not let us think about it any more . \" \" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ? \" \" Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she can not feel herself justified in declining . I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton , and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it ! It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh ! no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that . Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy 's son wanted to speak with him . Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints-- I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , if she gets out at all . And poor John 's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr. Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond . That was what happened before tea . It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton . \" Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill 's going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence . What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler 's own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill-- which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady . There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma 's attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind . The contrast between Mrs. Churchill 's importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax 's , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman 's destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates 's saying , \" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte . What is to become of that?--Very true . Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.-- ` You must go , ' said she . ` You and I must part . You will have no business here.--Let it stay , however , ' said she ; ` give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back . I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties . ' -- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter 's . \" Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 12], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [30, 31], "text": "she"}, {"position": [58, 59], "text": "her"},
