{"document": "XVIII Mr. Frank Churchill did not come . When the time proposed drew near , Mrs. Weston 's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse . For the present , he could not be spared , to his \" very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period . \" Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression . It soon flies over the present failure , and begins to hope again . For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank 's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner . These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs. Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself . Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill 's not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls . The acquaintance at present had no charm for her . She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship . She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more , ) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away . She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of Mrs. Weston 's arguments against herself . \" The Churchills are very likely in fault , \" said Mr. Knightley , coolly ; \" but I dare say he might come if he would . \" \" I do not know why you should say so . He wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him . \" \" I can not believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it . It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof . \" \" How odd you are ! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ? \" \" I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too . If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January . A man at his age -- what is he?--three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that . It is impossible . \" \" That 's easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master . You are the worst judge in the world , Mr. Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence . You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage . \" \" It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount . He can not want money -- he can not want leisure . We know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom . We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other . A little while ago , he was at Weymouth . This proves that he can leave the Churchills . \" \" Yes , sometimes he can . \" \" And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure . \" \" It is very unfair to judge of any body 's conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation . Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be . We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs. Churchill 's temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do . He may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others . \" \" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution . It is Frank Churchill 's duty to pay this attention to his father . He knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done . A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs. Churchill-- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately . I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion . I shall , therefore , set off to - morrow . ' -- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going . \" \" No , \" said Emma , laughing ; \" but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use!--Nobody but you , Mr. Knightley , would imagine it possible . But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable ? \" \" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it . He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner-- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do . Respect would be added to affection . They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . Respect for right conduct is felt by every body . If he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his . \" \" I rather doubt that . You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr. Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill 's situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect . The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through . To him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought . He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it . \" \" Then it would not be so strong a sense . If it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction . \" \" Oh , the difference of situation and habit ! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life . \" \" Our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others . It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency . I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man . As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority . He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father . Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now . \" \" We shall never agree about him , \" cried Emma ; \" but that is nothing extraordinary . I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not . Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man 's perfection . I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others . \" \" Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it . He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father 's having any right to complain . His letters disgust me . \" \" Your feelings are singular . They seem to satisfy every body else . \" \" I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston . They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother 's place , but without a mother 's affection to blind her . It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission . Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no . Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ? No , Emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in French , not in English . He may be very ` aimable , ' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him . \" \" You seem determined to think ill of him . \" \" Me!--not at all , \" replied Mr. Knightley , rather displeased ; \" I do not want to think ill of him . I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners . \" \" Well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at Highbury . We do not often look upon fine young men , well - bred and agreeable . We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain . Can not you imagine , Mr. Knightley , what a _ sensation _ his coming will produce ? There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury ; but one interest-- one object of curiosity ; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else . \" \" You will excuse my being so much over - powered . If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts . \" \" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable . To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him . \" \" And mine , \" said Mr. Knightley warmly , \" is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing ! What ! at three - and - twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man-- the practised politician , who is to read every body 's character , and make every body 's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority ; to be dispensing his flatteries around , that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself ! My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point . \" \" I will say no more about him , \" cried Emma , \" you turn every thing to evil . We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here . \" \" Prejudiced ! I am not prejudiced . \" \" But I am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it . My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour . \" \" He is a person I never think of from one month 's end to another , \" said Mr. Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry . To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another .
