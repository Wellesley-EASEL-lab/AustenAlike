{"document": "XVII Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield . The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and Mr. Woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness . The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr. Elton 's best compliments , \" that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them . \" Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr . Elton 's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired . She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced . Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded . She had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father 's suspicion . It did , however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language . It was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening . Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude . She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark . She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman 's return . She went to Mrs. Goddard 's accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was.-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred-- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . The confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of Harriet 's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again . Harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody-- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend . Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet 's side , not her own . Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of . The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.-- She never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible . Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma 's eyes-- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . Her second duty now , inferior only to her father 's claims , was to promote Harriet 's comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making . She got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts . Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet 's age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton 's return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _ unrequited _ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force . If Mr. Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet 's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him . Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three . Not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society . They must encounter each other , and make the best of it . Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard 's ; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth . Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself .", "clusters":
