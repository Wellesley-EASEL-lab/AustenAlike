{"document": "V \" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs. Weston , \" said Mr. Knightley , \" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing . \" \" A bad thing ! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so ? \" \" I think they will neither of them do the other any good . \" \" You surprize me ! Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good ! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley . \" \" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . \" \" Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . They will read together . She means it , I know . \" \" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old . I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now . But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma . She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not . \" \" I dare say , \" replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , \" that I thought so _ then_;--but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma 's omitting to do any thing I wished . \" \" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _ that_,\"--said Mr. Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done . \" But I , \" he soon added , \" who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember . Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family . At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen . She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her . She inherits her mother 's talents , and must have been under subjection to her . \" \" I should have been sorry , Mr. Knightley , to be dependent on _ your _ recommendation , had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse 's family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held . \" \" Yes , \" said he , smiling . \" You are better placed _ here _ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess . But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield . You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _ her _ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , I should certainly have named Miss Taylor . \" \" Thank you . There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston . \" \" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne . We will not despair , however . Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him . \" \" I hope not _ that_.--It is not likely . No , Mr. Knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter . \" \" Not I , indeed . I only name possibilities . I do not pretend to Emma 's genius for foretelling and guessing . I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune.--But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith . I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have . She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing . She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned . Her ignorance is hourly flattery . How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ? And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _ she _ can not gain by the acquaintance . Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to . She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home . I am much mistaken if Emma 's doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish . \" \" I either depend more upon Emma 's good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I can not lament the acquaintance . How well she looked last night ! \" \" Oh ! you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ? Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma 's being pretty . \" \" Pretty ! say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ? \" \" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . But I am a partial old friend . \" \" Such an eye!--the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant ! regular features , open countenance , with a complexion ! oh ! what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ` the picture of health ; ' now , Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown - up health . She is loveliness itself . Mr. Knightley , is not she ? \" \" I have not a fault to find with her person , \" he replied . \" I think her all you describe . I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain . Considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way . Mrs. Weston , I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm . \" \" And I , Mr. Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm . With all dear Emma 's little faults , she is an excellent creature . Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times . \" \" Very well ; I will not plague you any more . Emma shall be an angel , and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella . John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children . I am sure of having their opinions with me . \" \" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma 's mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith 's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you . Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it can not be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you can not be surprized , Mr. Knightley , at this little remains of office . \" \" Not at all , \" cried he ; \" I am much obliged to you for it . It is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to . \" \" Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister . \" \" Be satisfied , \" said he , \" I will not raise any outcry . I will keep my ill - humour to myself . I have a very sincere interest in Emma . Isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great . There is an anxiety , a curiosity in what one feels for Emma . I wonder what will become of her ! \" \" So do I , \" said Mrs. Weston gently , \" very much . \" \" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for . It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object . I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home . \" \" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present , \" said Mrs. Weston , \" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I can not wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse 's account . I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma , though I mean no slight to the state , I assure you . \" Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston 's on the subject , as much as possible . There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma 's destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to \" What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? \" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "I"}, {"position":
