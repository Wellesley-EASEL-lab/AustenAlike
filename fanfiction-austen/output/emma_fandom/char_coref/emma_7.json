{"document": "VII The very day of Mr. Elton 's going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma 's services towards her friend . Harriet had been at Hartfield , as usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a time , had gone home to return again to dinner : she returned , and sooner than had been talked of , and with an agitated , hurried look , announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell . Half a minute brought it all out . She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard 's , that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr. Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage . \" Who could have thought it ? She was so surprized she did not know what to do . Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so . And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.-- \" Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful . \" Upon my word , \" she cried , \" the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking . He will connect himself well if he can . \" \" Will you read the letter ? \" cried Harriet . \" Pray do . I 'd rather you would . \" Emma was not sorry to be pressed . She read , and was surprized . The style of the letter was much above her expectation . There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer . It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling . She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a \" Well , well , \" and was at last forced to add , \" Is it a good letter ? or is it too short ? \" \" Yes , indeed , a very good letter , \" replied Emma rather slowly--\"so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him . I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman . No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words . It is so with some men . Yes , I understand the sort of mind . Vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse . A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it , ) than I had expected . \" \" Well , \" said the still waiting Harriet;--\"well -- and -- and what shall I do ? \" \" What shall you do ! In what respect ? Do you mean with regard to this letter ? \" \" Yes . \" \" But what are you in doubt of ? You must answer it of course -- and speedily . \" \" Yes . But what shall I say ? Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me . \" \" Oh no , no ! the letter had much better be all your own . You will express yourself very properly , I am sure . There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing . Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _ your _ mind , I am persuaded . You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment . \" \" You think I ought to refuse him then , \" said Harriet , looking down . \" Ought to refuse him ! My dear Harriet , what do you mean ? Are you in any doubt as to that ? I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake . I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _ purport _ of your answer . I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it . \" Harriet was silent . With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued : \" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect . \" \" No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean -- What shall I do ? What would you advise me to do ? Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do . \" \" I shall not give you any advice , Harriet . I will have nothing to do with it . This is a point which you must settle with your feelings . \" \" I had no notion that he liked me so very much , \" said Harriet , contemplating the letter . For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , \" I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _ doubts _ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . If she can hesitate as to ` Yes , ' she ought to say ` No ' directly . It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you . But do not imagine that I want to influence you . \" \" Oh ! no , I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that -- As you say , one 's mind ought to be quite made up -- One should not be hesitating -- It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say ` No , ' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say ` No ? ' \" \" Not for the world , \" said Emma , smiling graciously , \" would I advise you either way . You must be the best judge of your own happiness . If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ? You blush , Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ? Harriet , Harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion . At this moment whom are you thinking of ? \" The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard . Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said-- \" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr. Martin . Do you think I am right ? \" \" Perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest Harriet ; you are doing just what you ought . While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving . Dear Harriet , I give myself joy of this . It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin . While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me . I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin , of Abbey - Mill Farm . Now I am secure of you for ever . \" Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . \" You could not have visited me ! \" she cried , looking aghast . \" No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before . That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world . \" \" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been . You would have thrown yourself out of all good society . I must have given you up . \" \" Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it ! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more ! \" \" Dear affectionate creature!--_You _ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm!--_You _ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life ! I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it . He must have a pretty good opinion of himself . \" \" I do not think he is conceited either , in general , \" said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; \" at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _ one _ is so very handsome and agreeable . However , I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration . \" \" Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend . We will not be parted . A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter . \" \" Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too . \" Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a \" very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter . \" \" Oh ! yes , very . Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions . I am quite determined to refuse him . But how shall I do ? What shall I say ? \" Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all . This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent . The business was finished , and Harriet safe . She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton . \" I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again , \" was said in rather a sorrowful tone . \" Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet . You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey - Mill . \" \" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield . \" Some time afterwards it was , \" I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened . I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper . \" \" One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet . I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married . Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes . As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark . The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of Highbury yet . Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves . \" Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much . The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin . \" Now he has got my letter , \" said she softly . \" I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . I hope he will not mind it so very much . \" \" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed , \" cried Emma . \" At this moment , perhaps , Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name . \" \" My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond - street . \" \" Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton . No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow . It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight . It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession . How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are ! \" Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [16, 17],
