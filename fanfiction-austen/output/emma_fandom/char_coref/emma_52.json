{"document": "XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . Their intercourse was painful enough by letter . How much worse , had they been obliged to meet ! Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella 's invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss . Harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist . Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister 's side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse 's carriage.--It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square . Now Emma could , indeed , enjoy Mr. Knightley 's visits ; now she could talk , and she could listen with true happiness , unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , of something most painful , which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how much might at that moment , and at a little distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself . The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard 's , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma 's sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself . She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied . There was a communication before her , one which _ she _ only could be competent to make-- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well . No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved-- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers . She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill . It would be a _ secret _ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name.-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , \" Beg her to walk up;\"--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging . There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , \" This is most kind , indeed!--Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words . \" Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs. Elton 's voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand . Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together . Miss Bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity . Emma could have wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm . She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton 's thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax 's confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady 's replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , \" We can finish this some other time , you know . You and I shall not want opportunities . And , in fact , you have heard all the essential already . I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology , and is not offended . You see how delightfully she writes . Oh ! she is a sweet creature ! You would have doated on her , had you gone.--But not a word more . Let us be discreet-- quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines-- I forget the poem at this moment : \" For when a lady 's in the case , \" You know all other things give place . \" Now I say , my dear , in _ our _ case , for _ lady _ , read----mum ! a word to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits , an't I ? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My _ representation , you see , has quite appeased her . \" And again , on Emma 's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates 's knitting , she added , in a half whisper , \" I mentioned no _ names _ , you will observe.--Oh ! no ; cautious as a minister of state . I managed it extremely well . \" Emma could not doubt . It was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion . When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with , \" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?--(here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane . ) Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!-- Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst!\" -- And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma , whispered farther , \" We do not say a word of any _ assistance _ that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh ! no ; Perry shall have all the credit . \" \" I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , \" she shortly afterwards began , \" since the party to Box Hill . Very pleasant party . But yet I think there was something wanting . Things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken . However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _ one _ exception . \" Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing . \" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness.--It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane 's prospects-- that is , I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.-- How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.-- Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes , indeed.-- Charming young man!--that is -- so very friendly ; I mean good Mr. Perry!-- such attention to Jane!\" --And from her great , her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there , Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane , from the vicarage quarter , which was now graciously overcome.-- After a few whispers , indeed , which placed it beyond a guess , Mrs. Elton , speaking louder , said , \" Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master . He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you . \" \" What ! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?-- That will be a favour indeed ! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr. Elton 's time is so engaged . \" \" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning to night.--There is no end of people 's coming to him , on some pretence or other.--The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion . They seem not able to do any thing without him.--`Upon my word , Mr. E. , ' I often say , ` rather you than I.-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants . ' --Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all . \" And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma--\"A congratulatory visit , you know.--Oh ! yes , quite indispensable . \" Miss Bates looked about her , so happily!-- \" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.--Mr . E. is Knightley 's right hand . \" Emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , \" Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk . \" \" Oh ! no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting . Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way . \" \" Have not you mistaken the day ? \" said Emma . \" I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow.--Mr . Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday . \" \" Oh ! no , the meeting is certainly to - day , \" was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton 's side.-- \" I do believe , \" she continued , \" this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . We never heard of such things at Maple Grove . \" \" Your parish there was small , \" said Jane . \" Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , for I never heard the subject talked of . \" \" But it is proved by the smallness of the school , which I have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children . \" \" Ah ! you clever creature , that 's very true . What a thinking brain you have ! I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together . My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _ some _ people may not think _ you _ perfection already.--But hush!-- not a word , if you please . \" It seemed an unnecessary caution ; Jane was wanting to give her words , not to Mrs. Elton , but to Miss Woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw . The wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look . Mr. Elton made his appearance . His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity . \" Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come!-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.-- Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ? \" Mr. Elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away . His civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing . \" When I got to Donwell , \" said he , \" Knightley could not be found . Very odd ! very unaccountable ! after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one . \" \" Donwell ! \" cried his wife.--\"My dear Mr. E. , you have not been to Donwell!--You mean the Crown ; you come from the meeting at the Crown . \" \" No , no , that 's to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!-- I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill - usage , ) which made it so much the worse . And then not to find him at home ! I assure you I am not at all pleased . And no apology left , no message for me . The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.-- Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone . Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods.-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it ? \" Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary , indeed , and that she had not a syllable to say for him . \" I can not imagine , \" said Mrs. Elton , ( feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do , ) \" I can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world ! The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;-- and his servants forgot it . Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs. Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it . \" \" I met William Larkins , \" continued Mr. Elton , \" as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour . He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him . I have nothing to do with William 's wants , but it really is of very great importance that _ I _ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose . \" Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly . In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr. Elton , if not towards William Larkins . She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say , \" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility . Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent . \" \" Oh ! \" cried Jane , with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure--\"there would have been no danger . The danger would have been of my wearying you . You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest-- . Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly , ) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- I have not time for half that I could wish to say . I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself . I feel it so very due . But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend-- \" \" Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , \" cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand . \" You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even-- \" \" You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you.-- So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you . \" \" Pray say no more . I feel that all the apologies should be on my side . Let us forgive each other at once . We must do whatever is to be done quickest , and I think our feelings will lose no time there . I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ? \" \" Very . \" \" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you-- just as I begin to know you . \" \" Oh ! as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet . I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell . \" \" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps , \" replied Emma , smiling--\"but , excuse me , it must be thought of . \" The smile was returned as Jane answered , \" You are very right ; it has been thought of . And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ) , that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled . There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for . \" \" Thank you , thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.-- Oh ! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!-- Good - bye , good - bye . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 9], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [15,
