{"document": "VI After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs. Suckling , the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn . No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present . In the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs. Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it . Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed . It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade . Her introductions and recommendations must all wait , and every projected party be still only talked of . So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off . Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come ? They could go there again with them in the autumn . It was settled that they should go to Box Hill . That there was to be such a party had been long generally known : it had even given the idea of another . Emma had never been to Box Hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and Mr. Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither . Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings . This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection . Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton , of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton 's party ! Every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston 's temper . \" I am glad you approve of what I have done , \" said he very comfortably . \" But I thought you would . Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . One can not have too large a party . A large party secures its own amusement . And she is a good - natured woman after all . One could not leave her out . \" Emma denied none of it aloud , and agreed to none of it in private . It was now the middle of June , and the weather fine ; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day , and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon - pies and cold lamb , when a lame carriage - horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty . It might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation . Mrs. Elton 's resources were inadequate to such an attack . \" Is not this most vexations , Knightley ? \" she cried.--\"And such weather for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious . What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston . \" \" You had better explore to Donwell , \" replied Mr. Knightley . \" That may be done without horses . Come , and eat my strawberries . They are ripening fast . \" If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight ; and the \" Oh ! I should like it of all things , \" was not plainer in words than manner . Donwell was famous for its strawberry - beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage - beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere . She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it . \" You may depend upon me , \" said she . \" I certainly will come . Name your day , and I will come . You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ? \" \" I can not name a day , \" said he , \" till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you . \" \" Oh ! leave all that to me . Only give me a carte - blanche.--I am Lady Patroness , you know . It is my party . I will bring friends with me . \" \" I hope you will bring Elton , \" said he : \" but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations . \" \" Oh ! now you are looking very sly . But consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _ me _ . I am no young lady on her preferment . Married women , you know , may be safely authorised . It is my party . Leave it all to me . I will invite your guests . \" \" No,\"--he calmly replied,--\"there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is-- \" \" --Mrs . Weston , I suppose , \" interrupted Mrs. Elton , rather mortified . \" No -- Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself . \" \" Ah ! you are an odd creature ! \" she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself.--\"You are a humourist , and may say what you like . Quite a humourist . Well , I shall bring Jane with me-- Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you . I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family . Do n't scruple . I know you are attached to them . \" \" You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home . \" \" That 's quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:--but as you like . It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing . I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon . Nothing can be more simple , you see . And Jane will have such another . There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party . We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know . Every thing as natural and simple as possible . Is not that your idea ? \" \" Not quite . My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors . When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house . \" \" Well -- as you please ; only do n't have a great set out . And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley . If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything-- \" \" I have not the least wish for it , I thank you . \" \" Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . \" \" I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body 's assistance . \" \" I wish we had a donkey . The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by . I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;--and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . \" \" You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury . Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . You can borrow Mrs. Cole 's . I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible . \" \" That I am sure you would . Indeed I do you justice , my good friend . Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart . As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . \" Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade . He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse , as well as Emma , to join the party ; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill . Mr. Woodhouse must not , under the specious pretence of a morning drive , and an hour or two spent at Donwell , be tempted away to his misery . He was invited on good faith . No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity . He did consent . He had not been at Donwell for two years . \" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma 's , and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning . He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them-- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out . \" Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body 's most ready concurrence . The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs. Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr. Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.-- Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come . In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing exactly right . Under a bright mid - day sun , at almost Midsummer , Mr. Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves.-- Mrs. Weston , who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit all the time with him , remained , when all the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient listener and sympathiser . It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father 's comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family . She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered-- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably . She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush . These were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds.--The whole party were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs. Elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of.--\"The best fruit in England-- every body 's favourite -- always wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one 's self -- the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired-- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison-- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- Chili preferred-- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in London-- abundance about Bristol -- Maple Grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule-- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit-- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries-- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer-- must go and sit in the shade . \" Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy.-- She had some fears of his horse . Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question . Mrs. Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures . It was not with Mrs. Suckling , it was not with Mrs. Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove . Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend 's negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow 's post.--How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal.-- \" Should not they walk ? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens-- all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent . \" --The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear . It was hot ; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes , which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river , seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.-- It led to nothing ; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars , which seemed intended , in their erection , to give the appearance of an approach to the house , which never had been there . Disputable , however , as might be the taste of such a termination , it was in itself a charming walk , and the view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope , at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood , gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds ; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur , well clothed with wood;-- and at the bottom of this bank , favourably placed and sheltered , rose the Abbey Mill Farm , with meadows in front , and the river making a close and handsome curve around it . It was a sweet view -- sweet to the eye and the mind . English verdure , English culture , English comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive . In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way . Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony . Now they seemed in pleasant conversation . There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm ; but now she feared it not . It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty , its rich pastures , spreading flocks , orchard in blossom , and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the wall , and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around . He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc . and Emma received a smile which seemed to say , \" These are my own concerns . I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin . \"--She did not suspect him . It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade was most refreshing , and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day . The next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still Frank Churchill did not come . Mrs. Weston looked , and looked in vain . His father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare . He had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty . \" His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them . \" --Mrs . Churchill 's state , however , as many were ready to remind her , was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe , or to say , that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.-- Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion . The cold repast was over , and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen , the old Abbey fish - ponds ; perhaps get as far as the clover , which was to be begun cutting on the morrow , or , at any rate , have the pleasure of being hot , and growing cool again.--Mr . Woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need . Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse 's entertainment . Books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered . Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused . Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him , and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child , than in a total want of taste for what he saw , for he was slow , constant , and methodical.--Before this second looking over was begun , however , Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments ' free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there , when Jane Fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape.-- Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of . \" Will you be so kind , \" said she , \" when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to any body . It would only be giving trouble and distress . Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk . Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ? \" \" Certainly , if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ? \" \" Yes -- what should hurt me?--I walk fast . I shall be at home in twenty minutes . \" \" But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone . Let my father 's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage . It can be round in five minutes . \" \" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account.--I would rather walk.-- And for _ me _ to be afraid of walking alone!--I , who may so soon have to guard others ! \" She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , \" That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now . I must order the carriage . The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already . \" \" I am,\"--she answered--\"I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . Mine , I confess , are exhausted . The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary . \" Emma had not another word to oppose . She saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend . Her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , \" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone!\" --seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best . \" Such a home , indeed ! such an aunt ! \" said Emma , as she turned back into the hall again . \" I do pity you . And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . \" Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark 's Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room . Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him . Mrs. Weston would be at ease . The black mare was blameless ; _ they _ were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause . He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late;--and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all . The heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold , etc . , but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse 's fire , looking very deplorable . \" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still , \" said Emma . \" As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again . I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming ! You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up . I met _ one _ as I came -- Madness in such weather!--absolute madness ! \" Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill 's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour . Some people were always cross when they were hot . Such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door . \" No -- he should not eat . He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter . \" In two minutes , however , he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something about spruce - beer , walked off . Emma returned all her attention to her father , saying in secret-- \" I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . Harriet 's sweet easy temper will not mind it . \" He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and , with good manners , like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late . He was not in his best spirits , but seemed trying to improve them ; and , at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably . They were looking over views in Swisserland . \" As soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go abroad , \" said he . \" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places . You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem . I shall do something to expose myself . \" \" That may be -- but not by sketches in Swisserland . You will never go to Swisserland . Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England . \" \" They may be induced to go too . A warm climate may be prescribed for her . I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad . I assure you I have . I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad . I ought to travel . I am tired of doing nothing . I want a change . I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England-- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could . \" \" You are sick of prosperity and indulgence . Can not you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ? \" \" _ I _ sick of prosperity and indulgence ! You are quite mistaken . I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . I am thwarted in every thing material . I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person . \" \" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came . Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well . Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us . \" \" No -- I shall not stir . I shall sit by you . You are my best cure . \" \" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow;--you will join us . It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . You will stay , and go with us ? \" \" No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening . \" \" But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning . \" \" No -- It will not be worth while . If I come , I shall be cross . \" \" Then pray stay at Richmond . \" \" But if I do , I shall be crosser still . I can never bear to think of you all there without me . \" \" These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . Chuse your own degree of crossness . I shall press you no more . \" The rest of the party were now returning , and all were soon collected . With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill ; others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax 's disappearance being explained . That it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day 's scheme , they parted . Frank Churchill 's little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to Emma were , \" Well;--if _ you _ wish me to stay and join the party , I will . \" She smiled her acceptance ; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [17, 20], "text": "the Highbury world"}],
