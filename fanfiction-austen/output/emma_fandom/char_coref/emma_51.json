{"document": "XV This letter must make its way to Emma 's feelings . She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold . As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment . She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever . She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr. Knightley came again , she desired him to read it . She was sure of Mrs. Weston 's wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct . \" I shall be very glad to look it over , \" said he ; \" but it seems long . I will take it home with me at night . \" But that would not do . Mr. Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him . \" I would rather be talking to you , \" he replied ; \" but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done . \" He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , \" Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman 's letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference . \" He proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , \" Humph ! a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way . One man 's style must not be the rule of another 's . We will not be severe . \" \" It will be natural for me , \" he added shortly afterwards , \" to speak my opinion aloud as I read . By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you . It will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it-- \" \" Not at all . I should wish it . \" Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity . \" He trifles here , \" said he , \" as to the temptation . He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the engagement.--`His father 's disposition:'-- he is unjust , however , to his father . Mr. Weston 's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true ; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here . \" \" And I have not forgotten , \" said Emma , \" how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would . You pass it over very handsomely-- but you were perfectly right . \" \" I was not quite impartial in my judgment , Emma:--but yet , I think-- had _ you _ not been in the case -- I should still have distrusted him . \" When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud -- all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus-- \" Very bad -- though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous game . Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.-- No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience.-- Fancying you to have fathomed his secret . Natural enough!-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding ! My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ? \" Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet 's account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of . \" You had better go on , \" said she . He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , \" the pianoforte ! Ah ! That was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure . A boyish scheme , indeed!--I can not comprehend a man 's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument 's coming if she could . \" After this , he made some progress without any pause . Frank Churchill 's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing . \" I perfectly agree with you , sir,\"--was then his remark . \" You did behave very shamefully . You never wrote a truer line . \" And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax 's sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , \" This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could . He should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been such ; but hers were all reasonable . We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . \" Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable . Her own behaviour had been so very improper ! She was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look . It was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist . \" There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends , the Eltons , \" was his next observation.--\"His feelings are natural.-- What ! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each-- she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well , he must be a most extraordinary-- \" \" Nay , nay , read on.--You will find how very much he suffers . \" \" I hope he does , \" replied Mr. Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter . \" ` Smallridge!' --What does this mean ? What is all this ? \" \" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge 's children-- a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment ? \" \" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs. Elton . Only one page more . I shall soon have done . What a letter the man writes ! \" \" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him . \" \" Well , there _ is _ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.--Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her . ` Dearer , much dearer than ever . ' I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve . ' Come , he knows himself there . ` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune . ' --Those were Miss Woodhouse 's words , were they?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter . The child of good fortune ! That was your name for him , was it ? \" \" You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still you must , at least I hope you must , think the better of him for it . I hope it does him some service with you . \" \" Yes , certainly it does . He has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to Miss Fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , I am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants . And now , let me talk to you of something else . I have another person 's interest at present so much at heart , that I can not think any longer about Frank Churchill . Ever since I left you this morning , Emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject . \" The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . Emma 's answer was ready at the first word . \" While her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her . She could never quit him . \" Part only of this answer , however , was admitted . The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to . He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father 's comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded . Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No , he felt that it ought not to be attempted . But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father 's happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise . Of their all removing to Donwell , Emma had already had her own passing thoughts . Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her . She was sensible of all the affection it evinced . She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with . She promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . He had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself . \" Ah ! there is one difficulty unprovided for , \" cried Emma . \" I am sure William Larkins will not like it . You must get his consent before you ask mine . \" She promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme . It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded . Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt . This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield-- the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became . His evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback . Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!-- Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy ! She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield . The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from . She would be a loser in every way . Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment . In such a party , Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment . In time , of course , Mr. Knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early . Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;-- not like Mr. Elton . Mr. Knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet , that she could be in love with more than _ three _ men in one year .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 9], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [12, 13], "text": "She"}, {"position": [19, 20], "text":
