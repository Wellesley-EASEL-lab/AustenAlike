{"document": "XI \" Harriet , poor Harriet!\" --Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _ his _ behaviour as her _ own _ , which made her so angry with him . It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet 's account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery . Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , \" Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith . \" --She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet 's imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . Her influence would have been enough . And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend 's happiness on most insufficient grounds . Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--\"But , with common sense , \" she added , \" I am afraid I have had little to do . \" She was extremely angry with herself . If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . This discovery laid many smaller matters open . No doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane 's eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed . An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison . She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge ! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet 's mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston 's parting words . \" For the present , the whole affair was to be completely a secret . Mr. Churchill had made a point of it , as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost ; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum . \" -- Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted . It was her superior duty . In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself . The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet 's footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _ she _ was approaching Randalls . Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!-- But of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance . \" Well , Miss Woodhouse ! \" cried Harriet , coming eagerly into the room-- \" is not this the oddest news that ever was ? \" \" What news do you mean ? \" replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint . \" About Jane Fairfax . Did you ever hear any thing so strange ? Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for Mr. Weston has told me himself . I met him just now . He told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it . \" \" What did Mr. Weston tell you?\" --said Emma , still perplexed . \" Oh ! he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while . How very odd ! \" It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet 's behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it . Her character appeared absolutely changed . She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery . Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak . \" Had you any idea , \" cried Harriet , \" of his being in love with her?--You , perhaps , might.--You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body 's heart ; but nobody else-- \" \" Upon my word , \" said Emma , \" I begin to doubt my having any such talent . Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly . \" \" Me ! \" cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished . \" Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill . \" \" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject , \" replied Emma , smiling ; \" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ? \" \" Him!--never , never . Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ? \" turning away distressed . \" Harriet ! \" cried Emma , after a moment 's pause--\"What do you mean?-- Good Heaven ! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?-- \" She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer . Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma 's . \" I should not have thought it possible , \" she began , \" that you could have misunderstood me ! I know we agreed never to name him-- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person . Mr. Frank Churchill , indeed ! I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other . I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill , who is like nobody by his side . And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing!--I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him . At first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words);-- I should not have dared to give way to -- I should not have thought it possible -- But if _ you _ , who had been always acquainted with him-- \" \" Harriet ! \" cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely--\"Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake . Are you speaking of -- Mr. Knightley ? \" \" To be sure I am . I never could have an idea of any body else-- and so I thought you knew . When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible . \" \" Not quite , \" returned Emma , with forced calmness , \" for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person . I could almost assert that you had _ named _ Mr. Frank Churchill . I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of . \" \" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget ! \" \" My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion . I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory . \" \" Oh , dear , \" cried Harriet , \" now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time . It was not the gipsies -- it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant . No ! ( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance-- of Mr. Knightley 's coming and asking me to dance , when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room . That was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth . \" \" Good God ! \" cried Emma , \" this has been a most unfortunate-- most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done ? \" \" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ? At least , however , I can not be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _ is _ possible-- \" She paused a few moments . Emma could not speak . \" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse , \" she resumed , \" that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body . You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other . But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if-- strange as it may appear-- . But you know they were your own words , that _ more _ wonderful things had happened , matches of _ greater _ disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before-- and if I should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to-- if Mr. Knightley should really -- if _ he _ does not mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way . But you are too good for that , I am sure . \" Harriet was standing at one of the windows . Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said , \" Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley 's returning your affection ? \" \" Yes , \" replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully--\"I must say that I have . \" Emma 's eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes . A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart . A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress . She touched-- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth . Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet 's having some hope of a return ? It darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself ! Her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes . She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before . How improperly had she been acting by Harriet ! How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct ! What blindness , what madness , had led her on ! It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world . Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet 's hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.--Emma 's tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet 's , but they were not less . Her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create.-- She listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to Harriet 's detail.--Methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit-- especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley 's most improved opinion of Harriet . Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse 's encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case . She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him-- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet . He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings.-- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet 's memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma . Circumstances that might swell to half an hour 's relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush . ) He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged.-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming:-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _ her _ . The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain . On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question . \" Might he not?--Is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to Mr. Martin-- he might have Mr. Martin 's interest in view ? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit . \" Mr. Martin ! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin . I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr. Martin , or to be suspected of it . \" When Harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope . \" I never should have presumed to think of it at first , \" said she , \" but for you . You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so I have . But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . \" The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma 's side , to enable her to say on reply , \" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . \" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him . \" She could not compose herself-- Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go;\"--with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma 's feelings : \" Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! \" The rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours . Every moment had brought a fresh surprize ; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all ! How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under!--The blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness . To understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour . To that point went every leisure moment which her father 's claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind . How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ? When had his influence , such influence begun?-- When had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for a short period , occupied?--She looked back ; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter 's becoming known to her-- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it-- oh ! had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear . She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all ! This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it.-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr. Knightley.-- Every other part of her mind was disgusting . With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body 's feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body 's destiny . She was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief . She had brought evil on Harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on Mr. Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case , he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly . Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , affording nothing to be said or thought.--Mr . Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her side ! Such a debasement on his ! It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No ; it was impossible . And yet it was far , very far , from impossible.--Was it a new circumstance for a man of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ? Was it new for one , perhaps too busy to seek , to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal , inconsistent , incongruous -- or for chance and circumstance ( as second causes ) to direct the human fate ? Oh ! had she never brought Harriet forward ! Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong-- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been . How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly.-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt.-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton 's being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.-- Alas ! was not that her own doing too ? Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self - consequence but herself?--Who but herself had taught her , that she was to elevate herself if possible , and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?-- If Harriet , from being humble , were grown vain , it was her doing too .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [18, 19], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [35, 36],
