{"document": "XIII The weather continued much the same all the following morning ; and the same loneliness , and the same melancholy , seemed to reign at Hartfield -- but in the afternoon it cleared ; the wind changed into a softer quarter ; the clouds were carried off ; the sun appeared ; it was summer again . With all the eagerness which such a transition gives , Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible . Never had the exquisite sight , smell , sensation of nature , tranquil , warm , and brilliant after a storm , been more attractive to her . She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr. Perry 's coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery.--There , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned from London . She had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind . She must be collected and calm . In half a minute they were together . The \" How d'ye do 's \" were quiet and constrained on each side . She asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning . He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her , she found . \" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors . \" --She thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received . They walked together . He was silent . She thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give . And this belief produced another dread . Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject . He must do it all himself . Yet she could not bear this silence . With him it was most unnatural . She considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began-- \" You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you . \" \" Have I ? \" said he quietly , and looking at her ; \" of what nature ? \" \" Oh ! the best nature in the world -- a wedding . \" After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied , \" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already . \" \" How is it possible ? \" cried Emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs. Goddard 's in his way . \" I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened . \" Emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure , \" _ You _ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it -- but--(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness . \" For a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low , \" Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father 's sake -- I know you will not allow yourself-- . \" Her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , \" The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel!\" -- And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , \" He will soon be gone . They will soon be in Yorkshire . I am sorry for _ her _ . She deserves a better fate . \" Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , \" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion . My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier . \" \" Emma ! \" cried he , looking eagerly at her , \" are you , indeed?\" -- but checking himself--\"No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret , indeed ! and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!--I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature . \" \" Mr. Knightley , \" said Emma , trying to be lively , but really confused-- \" I am in a very extraordinary situation . I can not let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.-- But I never have . \" He listened in perfect silence . She wished him to speak , but he would not . She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion . She went on , however . \" I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased.-- An old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding . Many circumstances assisted the temptation . He was the son of Mr. Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions . Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed-- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side . He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me . I have never been attached to him . And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . He never wished to attach me . It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was _ not _ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him . \" She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought . At last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said , \" I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him . My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well . \" \" I have no doubt of their being happy together , \" said Emma ; \" I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached . \" \" He is a most fortunate man ! \" returned Mr. Knightley , with energy . \" So early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize ! What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax 's character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one-- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _ her _ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune . Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , can not even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.-- He had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him.-- He is a fortunate man indeed ! \" \" You speak as if you envied him . \" \" And I do envy him , Emma . In one respect he is the object of my envy . \" Emma could say no more . They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible . She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr. Knightley startled her , by saying , \" You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.--You are wise -- but _ I _ can not be wise . Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment . \" \" Oh ! then , do n't speak it , do n't speak it , \" she eagerly cried . \" Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself . \" \" Thank you , \" said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed . Emma could not bear to give him pain . He was wishing to confide in her-- perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would , she would listen . She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They had reached the house . \" You are going in , I suppose ? \" said he . \" No,\"--replied Emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke--\"I should like to take another turn . Mr. Perry is not gone . \" And , after proceeding a few steps , she added-- \" I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr. Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like . I will tell you exactly what I think . \" \" As a friend!\" --repeated Mr. Knightley.--\"Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate?-- I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma , I accept your offer-- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend.--Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ? \" He stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her . \" My dearest Emma , \" said he , \" for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour 's conversation , my dearest , most beloved Emma -- tell me at once . Say ` No , ' if it is to be said . \" -- She could really say nothing.--\"You are silent , \" he cried , with great animation ; \" absolutely silent ! at present I ask no more . \" Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment . The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling . \" I can not make speeches , Emma : \" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.--\"If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more . But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them . The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them . God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover.-- But you understand me.--Yes , you see , you understand my feelings-- and will return them if you can . At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice . \" While he spoke , Emma 's mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word-- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet 's hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet 's secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two-- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not . She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain . She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading . Her way was clear , though not quite smooth.--She spoke then , on being so entreated.-- What did she say?--Just what she ought , of course . A lady always does.-- She said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself . He _ had _ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation . Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material.-- Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his . He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence . He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it . He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill 's engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings . The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his!--Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name . _ Her _ change was equal.--This one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust.--On his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other . It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away . He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.-- But he had gone to a wrong place . There was too much domestic happiness in his brother 's house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning 's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery . He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him . Frank Churchill 's character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [68, 69], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [106, 107], "text": "her"}, {"position": [108, 109], "text": "She"},
