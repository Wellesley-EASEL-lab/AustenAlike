{"document": "XV Emma was not required , by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton . Her observation had been pretty correct . Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again,--self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred . She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs. Elton 's consequence only could surpass . There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from his wife . He seemed not merely happy with her , but proud . He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates 's good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs. Elton 's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being \" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . \" In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first . Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended , probably , by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , the ill - will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma 's dislike . Her manners , too -- and Mr. Elton 's , were unpleasant towards Harriet . They were sneering and negligent . Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet 's cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet 's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also . She was , of course , the object of their joint dislike.-- When they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet . Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax ; and from the first . Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration-- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all Mrs. Elton 's knight - errantry on the subject.-- \" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.-- And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . We must bring her forward . Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet , ` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air . ' We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax . \" \" I can not think there is any danger of it , \" was Emma 's calm answer-- \" and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax 's situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . \" \" Oh ! but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end ! And I think she feels it . I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent . One can see that she feels the want of encouragement . I like her the better for it . I must confess it is a recommendation to me . I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . Oh ! I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . \" \" You appear to feel a great deal -- but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax 's acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than\"-- \" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . You and I need not be afraid . If _ we _ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations . _ We _ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _ we _ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _ more _ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it . I have no idea of that sort of thing . It is not likely that I _ should _ , considering what I have been used to . My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense . Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be-- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr. Suckling , in income.--However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation . My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties . \" \" Poor Jane Fairfax!\" --thought Emma.--\"You have not deserved this . You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax . ' Heavens ! Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me!-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman 's tongue ! \" Emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a \" dear Miss Woodhouse . \" The change on Mrs. Elton 's side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton , nor , under Mrs. Elton 's guidance , the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done . She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates 's gratitude for Mrs. Elton 's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth . She was quite one of her worthies-- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered . Emma 's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do . She heard of her walking with the Eltons , sitting with the Eltons , spending a day with the Eltons ! This was astonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer . \" She is a riddle , quite a riddle ! \" said she.--\"To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort ! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton 's notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection . \" Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months ; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months ; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer , and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there . According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly . Would Jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it ! \" She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation , \" was Emma 's conclusion . \" She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself . There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere.-- She is _ not _ to be with the _ Dixons _ . The decree is issued by somebody . But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle . \" Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject , before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton , Mrs. Weston ventured this apology for Jane . \" We can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home . Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome . We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . \" \" You are right , Mrs. Weston , \" said Mr. Knightley warmly , \" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton . Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . \" Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth . With a faint blush , she presently replied , \" Such attentions as Mrs. Elton 's , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax . Mrs. Elton 's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . \" \" I should not wonder , \" said Mrs. Weston , \" if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt 's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton 's civilities for her . Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change . \" Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said , \" Another thing must be taken into consideration too -- Mrs. Elton does not talk _ to _ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _ of _ her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other-- a something more early implanted . We can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton 's way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness . \" \" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , \" said Emma . Little Henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say . \" Yes , \" he replied , \" any body may know how highly I think of her . \" \" And yet , \" said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once-- she hurried on--\"And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . \" Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered , \" Oh ! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand . Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago . \" He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston , and did not herself know what to think . In a moment he went on-- \" That will never be , however , I can assure you . Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her -- and I am very sure I shall never ask her . \" Emma returned her friend 's pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim , \" You are not vain , Mr. Knightley . I will say that for you . \" He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said , \" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? \" \" No indeed I have not . You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you . What I said just now , meant nothing . One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning . Oh ! no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body . You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married . \" Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again . The result of his reverie was , \" No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . \" And soon afterwards , \" Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect . She has a fault . She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife . \" Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault . \" Well , \" said she , \" and you soon silenced Mr. Cole , I suppose ? \" \" Yes , very soon . He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more . Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . \" \" In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world ! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles-- what she calls them ! How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ? She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax 's mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton 's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding . I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau . \" \" Jane Fairfax has feeling , \" said Mr. Knightley--\"I do not accuse her of want of feeling . Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness . She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper . No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond . \" \" Well , Mrs. Weston , \" said Emma triumphantly when he left them , \" what do you say now to Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax ? \" \" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . Do not beat me . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "her"}, {"position": [20, 21], "text": "Her"}, {"position": [33, 34], "text":
