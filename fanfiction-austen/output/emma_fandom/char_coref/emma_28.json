{"document": "X The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs. Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte . Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again . \" This is a pleasure , \" said he , in rather a low voice , \" coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated . You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed . \" \" What ! \" said Mrs. Weston , \" have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate . \" \" I have not been working uninterruptedly , \" he replied , \" I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe . You see we have been wedging one leg with paper . This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . \" He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again . That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again . At last Jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to . Mrs. Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise . \" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ , \" said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , \" the person has not chosen ill . I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell 's taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _ all _ _ that _ _ party _ would particularly prize . I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself . Do not you think so ? \" Jane did not look round . She was not obliged to hear . Mrs. Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment . \" It is not fair , \" said Emma , in a whisper ; \" mine was a random guess . Do not distress her . \" He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy . Soon afterwards he began again , \" How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax . I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument 's coming to hand . Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ? \" He paused . She could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering , \" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell , \" said she , in a voice of forced calmness , \" I can imagine nothing with any confidence . It must be all conjecture . \" \" Conjecture -- aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong . I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm . What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all;--your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing . There , it is done . I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present . \" He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more . \" If you are very kind , \" said he , \" it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;--let me live them over again . You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time . I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds-- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half - hour . \" She played . \" What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _ has _ made one happy!-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth . \" She looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else . He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to Emma , said , \" Here is something quite new to me . Do you know it?--Cramer.-- And here are a new set of Irish melodies . That , from such a quarter , one might expect . This was all sent with the instrument . Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here . I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart . Nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete . True affection only could have prompted it . \" Emma wished he would be less pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile , when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had been a smile of secret delight , she had less scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with respect to her.--This amiable , upright , perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings . He brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together.-- Emma took the opportunity of whispering , \" You speak too plain . She must understand you . \" \" I hope she does . I would have her understand me . I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning . \" \" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea . \" \" I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me . I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways . Leave shame to her . If she does wrong , she ought to feel it . \" \" She is not entirely without it , I think . \" \" I do not see much sign of it . She is playing _ Robin _ _ Adair _ at this moment--_his _ favourite . \" Shortly afterwards Miss Bates , passing near the window , descried Mr. Knightley on horse - back not far off . \" Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible , just to thank him . I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother 's room you know . I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here . Quite delightful to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured ! \" She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called Mr. Knightley 's attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment . \" How d ' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well , I thank you . So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . Pray come in ; do come in . You will find some friends here . \" So began Miss Bates ; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say , \" How is your niece , Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold last night . How is she to - day ? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . \" And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else . The listeners were amused ; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning . But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism . \" So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage , \" resumed Miss Bates . He cut her short with , \" I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ? \" \" Oh ! dear , Kingston -- are you?--Mrs . Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston . \" \" Mrs. Cole has servants to send . Can I do any thing for _ you _ ? \" \" No , I thank you . But do come in . Who do you think is here?-- Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in . \" \" Well , \" said he , in a deliberating manner , \" for five minutes , perhaps . \" \" And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful ; so many friends ! \" \" No , not now , I thank you . I could not stay two minutes . I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can . \" \" Oh ! do come in . They will be so very happy to see you . \" \" No , no ; your room is full enough . I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte . \" \" Well , I am so sorry!--Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?-- Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . \" \" Oh ! very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes . And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England . Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I can not stay to hear it . \" \" Oh ! Mr. Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence-- so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples ! \" \" What is the matter now ? \" \" To think of your sending us all your store apples . You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . We really are so shocked ! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry . William Larkins mentioned it here . You should not have done it , indeed you should not . Ah ! he is off . He never can bear to be thanked . But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned . . . . Well , ( returning to the room , ) I have not been able to succeed . Mr. Knightley can not stop . He is going to Kingston . He asked me if he could do any thing . . . . \" \" Yes , \" said Jane , \" we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . \" \" Oh ! yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud . You must have heard every thing to be sure . ` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ? ' said he ; so I just mentioned . . . . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , must you be going?--You seem but just come -- so very obliging of you . \" Emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates , before they set off for Randalls .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [17, 19], "text": "Mrs. Bates"}, {"position": [22, 23], "text": "her"}, {"position": [41, 42], "text": "her"}, {"position": [47, 48],
