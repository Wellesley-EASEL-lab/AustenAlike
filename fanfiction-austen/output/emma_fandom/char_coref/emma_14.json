{"document": "XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston 's drawing - room;--Mr . Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill - humour . Mr. Elton must smile less , and Mr. John Knightley more , to fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was . To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons . Mr. Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself . She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour 's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each . This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day 's visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton 's oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost . The misfortune of Harriet 's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella 's coming , and of Emma 's being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma . Emma 's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of \" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!\" -- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet 's , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton 's nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to . She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words \" my son , \" and \" Frank , \" and \" my son , \" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward . Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma 's resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested her . She had frequently thought -- especially since his father 's marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _ were _ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition . He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;-- for when happily released from Mr. Elton , and seated by Mr. Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her , \" We want only two more to be just the right number . I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete . I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank . I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight . \" Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete . \" He has been wanting to come to us , \" continued Mr. Weston , \" ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he can not command his own time . He has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices . But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January . \" \" What a very great pleasure it will be to you ! and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself . \" \" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off . She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do . The case , you see , is--(but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room . There are secrets in all families , you know)--The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank 's coming depends upon their being put off . If they are not put off , he can not stir . But I know they will , because it is a family that a certain lady , of some consequence , at Enscombe , has a particular dislike to : and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years , they always are put off when it comes to the point . I have not the smallest doubt of the issue . I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing . \" \" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case , \" replied Emma ; \" but am disposed to side with you , Mr. Weston . If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe . \" \" Yes -- I have some right to that knowledge ; though I have never been at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank 's account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him . I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ) . And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper . \" Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs. Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy-- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : \" for I can not depend upon his coming . I can not be so sanguine as Mr. Weston . I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing . Mr. Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ? \" \" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs. Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world . \" \" My Emma ! \" replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , \" what is the certainty of caprice ? \" Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before--\"You must know , my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper . To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth . Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him . \" \" Oh , Mrs. Churchill ; every body knows Mrs. Churchill , \" replied Isabella : \" and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion . To be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful . It is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery . What a blessing , that she never had any children ! Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them ! \" Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston . She should then have heard more : Mrs. Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge . But at present there was nothing more to be said . Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing - room . To be sitting long after dinner , was a confinement that he could not endure . Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him ; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable . While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying , \" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain . I am sorry for it . The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better . \" \" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays . Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us . I can not bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves . There is jealousy . They are jealous even of his regard for his father . In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine . \" \" He ought to come , \" said Emma . \" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man 's not having it in his power to do as much as that . A young _ woman _ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one can not comprehend a young _ man _ 's being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it . \" \" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do , \" replied Mrs. Weston . \" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _ she _ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her . \" \" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . Now , according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _ him _ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all . \" \" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way . I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _ when _ it will be . \" Emma listened , and then coolly said , \" I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes . \" \" He may have a great deal of influence on some points , \" continued Mrs. Weston , \" and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 10], "text": "each gentleman"},
