{"document": "XVI Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton , was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage . Dinner - parties and evening - parties were made for him and his lady ; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day . \" I see how it is , \" said she . \" I see what a life I am to lead among you . Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . We really seem quite the fashion . If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss . \" No invitation came amiss to her . Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners . She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card - parties . Mrs. Bates , Mrs. Perry , Mrs. Goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged . In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order . Emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons . They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment . A dinner there must be . After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes , Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him . The persons to be invited , required little thought . Besides the Eltons , it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; so far it was all of course-- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet 's begging to be allowed to decline it . \" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help . She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home . \" It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing . She was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend -- for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home ; and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth , Jane Fairfax.-- Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.--Mr . Knightley 's words dwelt with her . He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her . \" This is very true , \" said she , \" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful.--Of the same age-- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend.-- She will never like me now . I have neglected her too long . But I will shew her greater attention than I have done . \" Every invitation was successful . They were all disengaged and all happy.-- The preparatory interest of this dinner , however , was not yet over . A circumstance rather unlucky occurred . The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them , and staying one whole day at Hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so . Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear-- and here would be a ninth -- and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in with a dinner - party . She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial . She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother . The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma . John Knightley came ; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day . He might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner . Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing him so , with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate , removed the chief of even Emma 's vexation . The day came , the party were punctually assembled , and Mr. John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable . Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner , he was talking to Miss Fairfax . Mrs. Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence-- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella 's information -- but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her . He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys , when it had been just beginning to rain . It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject , and he said , \" I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time . I hope you turned directly . \" \" I went only to the post - office , \" said she , \" and reached home before the rain was much . It is my daily errand . I always fetch the letters when I am here . It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out . A walk before breakfast does me good . \" \" Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . \" \" No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out . \" Mr. John Knightley smiled , and replied , \" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before . The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives . When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . \" There was a little blush , and then this answer , \" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . \" \" Indifferent ! Oh ! no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent . Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse . \" \" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship . \" \" I have often thought them the worst of the two , \" replied he coolly . \" Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does . \" \" Ah ! you are not serious now . I know Mr. John Knightley too well-- I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day . \" \" When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years , \" said John Knightley , \" I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . I consider one as including the other . Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change I had in view for you . As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have . \" It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence . A pleasant \" thank you \" seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh . Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity , said , \" I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies should take care of themselves.-- Young ladies are delicate plants . They should take care of their health and their complexion . My dear , did you change your stockings ? \" \" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me . \" \" My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well . They are some of my very old friends . I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure . My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . \" The kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy . By this time , the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane . \" My dear Jane , what is this I hear?--Going to the post - office in the rain!--This must not be , I assure you.--You sad girl , how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you . \" Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold . \" Oh ! do not tell _ me _ . You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the post - office indeed ! Mrs. Weston , did you ever hear the like ? You and I must positively exert our authority . \" \" My advice , \" said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively , \" I certainly do feel tempted to give . Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks.-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . The spring I always think requires more than common care . Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . Now do not you feel that you had ? Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . You look as if you would not do such a thing again . \" \" Oh ! she _ shall _ _ not _ do such a thing again , \" eagerly rejoined Mrs. Elton . \" We will not allow her to do such a thing again:\"-- and nodding significantly--\"there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _ us _ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation . \" \" You are extremely kind , \" said Jane ; \" but I can not give up my early walk . I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . \" \" My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves . But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out . If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . \" \" Excuse me , \" said Jane earnestly , \" I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama 's . \" \" Oh ! my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to employ our men . \" Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered ; but instead of answering , she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley . \" The post - office is a wonderful establishment ! \" said she.-- \" The regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing ! \" \" It is certainly very well regulated . \" \" So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost ! And when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder . \" \" The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them . If you want any farther explanation , \" continued he , smiling , \" they are paid for it . That is the key to a great deal of capacity . The public pays and must be served well . \" The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of , and the usual observations made . \" I have heard it asserted , \" said John Knightley , \" that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough . But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike . I have not always known their writing apart . \" \" Yes , \" said his brother hesitatingly , \" there is a likeness . I know what you mean -- but Emma 's hand is the strongest . \" \" Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , \" said Mr. Woodhouse ; \" and always did . And so does poor Mrs. Weston\"--with half a sigh and half a smile at her . \" I never saw any gentleman 's handwriting\"--Emma began , looking also at Mrs. Weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect , \" Now , how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend-- your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad.--No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and better.--Now for it . \" Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--\"Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman 's hands I ever saw . \" \" I do not admire it , \" said Mr. Knightley . \" It is too small-- wants strength . It is like a woman 's writing . \" This was not submitted to by either lady . They vindicated him against the base aspersion . \" No , it by no means wanted strength-- it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong . Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce ? \" No , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away . \" If we were in the other room , \" said Emma , \" if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen . I have a note of his.-- Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? \" \" He chose to say he was employed\"-- \" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . \" \" Oh ! when a gallant young man , like Mr. Frank Churchill , \" said Mr. Knightley dryly , \" writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best . \" Dinner was on table.--Mrs . Elton , before she could be spoken to , was ready ; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining - parlour , was saying-- \" Must I go first ? I really am ashamed of always leading the way . \" Jane 's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma . She had heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any . She suspected that it _ had _ ; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear , and that it had not been in vain . She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits . She could have made an inquiry or two , as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue 's end-- but she abstained . She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax 's feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 13], "text": "Mr. Elton"}, {"position": [18, 19], "text": "him"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text": "his"},
