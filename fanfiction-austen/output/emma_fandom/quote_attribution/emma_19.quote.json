My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well . She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work'-- do n't you , ma'am?--And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her-- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word .

No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at least . Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland . Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane 's letter -- wrote in Mr. Dixon 's name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy . Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr. Dixon , I mean-- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter 's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself .

However , when I read on , I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first ; and I make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it . But I can not imagine how I could be so off my guard . If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr. Perry . The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know .
