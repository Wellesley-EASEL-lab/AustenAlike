She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain . She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading . Her way was clear , though not quite smooth.--She spoke then , on being so entreated.-- What did she say?--Just what she ought , of course . A lady always does.-- She said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself . He _ had _ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation . Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material.-- Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his . He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence . He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it . He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill 's engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings . The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his!--Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name . _ Her _ change was equal.--This one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust.--On his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other . It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away . He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.-- But he had gone to a wrong place . There was too much domestic happiness in his brother 's house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning 's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery . He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him . Frank Churchill 's character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good"}], "Mr. Knightley": [{"position": [488, 489], "text": "\""}, {"position": [493, 503], "text": "\" said he quietly , and looking at her ;"}, {"position": [508, 509], "text": "\""}, {"position": [522, 543], "text": "\" After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied ,"}, {"position": [566, 600], "text": "\" cried Emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs. Goddard 's in his way ."}, {"position": [706, 758], "text": "\" For a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low ,"}, {"position": [833, 861], "text": ", \" He will soon be gone .
