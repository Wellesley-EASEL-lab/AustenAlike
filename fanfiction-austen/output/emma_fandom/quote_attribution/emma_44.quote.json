But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well . She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her .

Nobody else would come so early . ' ` Well , ' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now . ' But then Patty came in , and said it was you . ` Oh !
