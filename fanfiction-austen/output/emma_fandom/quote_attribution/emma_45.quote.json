How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was also a very early speculation with Emma . The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . She saw in a moment all the possible good . Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter . Mr. Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. Churchill 's death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma 's side . It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet 's opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it . The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message ."}, {"position": [1824, 2188], "text": "\" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge 's at the time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged-- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . Her spirits seemed overcome . Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:-- confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise-- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . The answer was only in this short note :"}, {"position": [2204, 2396], "text": "\" Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates 's , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her-- but it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried-- but all in vain . Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in ."}], "Jane": [{"position": [2457, 2623], "text": "\" Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note . In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but"}, {"position": [2667, 2869], "text": "\" When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together-- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _ her _ . She was sorry , very sorry . Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove ."}]}
