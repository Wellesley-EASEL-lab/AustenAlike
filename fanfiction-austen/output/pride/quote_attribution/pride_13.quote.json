But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was , in every respect , so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming , her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it .
