{"Elizabeth": [{"position": [198, 525], "text": "Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . \u201d"}, {"position": [578, 1358], "text": "By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I can not answer for being coherent . Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . Though Lydia \u2019s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. , intending to trace their route . He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney - coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . I know not what to think . After making every possible inquiry on that side of London , Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success,--no such people had been seen to pass through . With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. ; but no one can throw any blame on them . Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . My father and mother believe the worst , but I can not think so ill of him . Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia \u2019s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to everything ? Impossible ! I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage : he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted . My poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . Could she exert herself , it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . Adieu ! I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such , that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening . In such an exigence my uncle \u2019s advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . \u201d"}, {"position": [1359, 1369], "text": "Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? \u201d"}, {"position": [1455, 1490], "text": "I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .
