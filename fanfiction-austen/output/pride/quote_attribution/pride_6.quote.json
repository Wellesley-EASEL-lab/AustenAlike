As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ; but of this hereafter . If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o\u2019clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\u2019nnight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .
