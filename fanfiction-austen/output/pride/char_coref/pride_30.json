{"document": "LX . Elizabeth \u2019s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . \u201c How could you begin ? \u201d said she . \u201c I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? \u201d \u201c I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . It is too long ago . I was in the middle before I knew that I _ had _ begun . \u201d \u201c My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . Now , be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? \u201d \u201c For the liveliness of your mind I did . \u201d \u201c You may as well call it impertinence at once . It was very little less . The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . I roused and interested you , because I was so unlike _ them _ . Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . To be sure you know no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . \u201d \u201c Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? \u201d \u201c Dearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ? But make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly , by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last ? What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? \u201d \u201c Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . \u201d \u201c But I was embarrassed . \u201d \u201c And so was I. \u201d \u201c You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . \u201d \u201c A man who had felt less might . \u201d \u201c How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . I wonder when you _ would _ have spoken if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . _ Too much _ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? This will never do . \u201d \u201c You need not distress yourself . The moral will be perfectly fair . Lady Catherine \u2019s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours . My aunt \u2019s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know everything . \u201d \u201c Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequences ? \u201d \u201c My real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . \u201d \u201c Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her ? \u201d \u201c I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . But it ought to be done ; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly . \u201d \u201c And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . \u201d From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner \u2019s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- \u201c I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . You supposed more than really existed . But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes . How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful . We will go round the park every day . I am the happiest creature in the world . Perhaps other people have said so before , but no one with such justice . I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me . You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . Yours , \u201d etc . Mr. Darcy \u2019s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style , and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins , in return for his last . / * \u201c Dear Sir , * / \u201c I must trouble you once more for congratulations . Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy . Console Lady Catherine as well as you can . But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . He has more to give . \u201c Yours sincerely , \u201d etc . Miss Bingley \u2019s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere . She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother \u2019s in sending it . Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge . The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew \u2019s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over . At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . He bore it , however , with admirable calmness . He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James \u2019s , with very decent composure . If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . Mrs. Philips \u2019s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs. Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley \u2019s good - humour encouraged ; yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar . Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . LXI . Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley , and talked of Mrs. Darcy , may be guessed . I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though , perhaps , it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do . He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart . The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified : he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire ; and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia ; and , removed from the influence of Lydia \u2019s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid . From the further disadvantage of Lydia \u2019s society she was of course carefully kept ; and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet \u2019s being quite unable to sit alone . Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters \u2019 beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance . As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters . He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and , in spite of everything , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . The letter was to this effect:-- / * \u201c My dear Lizzy , * / \u201c I wish you joy . If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . It is a great comfort to have you so rich ; and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not . \u201c Yours , \u201d etc . As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind . Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses , she frequently sent them . It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills . Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought . His affection for her soon sunk into indifference : hers lasted a little longer ; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . Though Darcy could never receive _ him _ at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth \u2019s sake , he assisted him further in his profession . Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long , that even Bingley \u2019s good - humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _ talk _ of giving them a hint to be gone . Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy \u2019s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropped all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth . Pemberley was now Georgiana \u2019s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive manner of talking to her brother . He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . By Elizabeth \u2019s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . But at length , by Elizabeth \u2019s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms . Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [11, 12], "text": "she"}, {"position": [25, 26], "text": "her"}, {"position": [30, 31], "text": "you"},
