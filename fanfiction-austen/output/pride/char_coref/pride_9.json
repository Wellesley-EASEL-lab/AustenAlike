{"document": "XVIII . Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield , and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted , for Mr. Darcy \u2019s pleasure , in the Bingleys \u2019 invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile,-- \u201c I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . \u201d This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth ; and , as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham \u2019s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham . She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill - humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and , having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress : they were dances of mortification . Mr. Collins , awkward and solemn , apologizing instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . The moment of her release from him was ecstasy . She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . When those dances were over , she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind : Charlotte tried to console her . \u201c I dare say you will find him very agreeable . \u201d \u201c Heaven forbid ! _ That _ would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . \u201d When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her , in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence . Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy , and reading in her neighbours \u2019 looks their equal amazement in beholding it . They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and , at first , was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . He replied , and was again silent . After a pause of some minutes , she addressed him a second time , with-- \u201c It is _ your _ turn to say something now , Mr. Darcy . _ I _ talked about the dance , and _ you _ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . \u201d He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . \u201c Very well ; that reply will do for the present . Perhaps , by - and - by , I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones ; but _ now _ we may be silent . \u201d \u201c Do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ? \u201d \u201c Sometimes . One must speak a little , you know . It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet , for the advantage of _ some _ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . \u201d \u201c Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? \u201d \u201c Both , \u201d replied Elizabeth archly ; \u201c for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the _ \u00e9clat _ of a proverb . \u201d \u201c This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , \u201d said he . \u201c How near it may be to _ mine _ , I can not pretend to say . _ You _ think it a faithful portrait , undoubtedly . \u201d \u201c I must not decide on my own performance . \u201d He made no answer ; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . She answered in the affirmative ; and , unable to resist the temptation , added , \u201c When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . \u201d The effect was immediate . A deeper shade of _ hauteur _ overspread his features , but he said not a word ; and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said,-- \u201c Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _ making _ friends ; whether he may be equally capable of _ retaining _ them , is less certain . \u201d \u201c He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , \u201d replied Elizabeth , with emphasis , \u201c and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . \u201d Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but , on perceiving Mr. Darcy , he stopped , with a bow of superior courtesy , to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . \u201c I have been most highly gratified , indeed , my dear sir ; such very superior dancing is not often seen . It is evident that you belong to the first circles . Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you : and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza ( glancing at her sister and Bingley ) , shall take place . What congratulations will then flow in ! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you , sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c Such very superior dancing is not often seen . \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William \u2019s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed , with a very serious expression , towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said,-- \u201c Sir William \u2019s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . \u201d \u201c I do not think we were speaking at all . Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I can not imagine . \u201d \u201c What think you of books ? \u201d said he , smiling . \u201c Books -- oh no!--I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . \u201d \u201c I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may compare our different opinions . \u201d \u201c No -- I can not talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . \u201d \u201c The _ present _ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ? \u201d said he , with a look of doubt . \u201c Yes , always , \u201d she replied , without knowing what she said ; for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , \u201c I remember hearing you once say , Mr. Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment , once created , was unappeasable . You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its _ being created _ ? \u201d \u201c I am , \u201d said he , with a firm voice . \u201c And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? \u201d \u201c I hope not . \u201d \u201c It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . \u201d \u201c May I ask to what these questions tend ? \u201d \u201c Merely to the illustration of _ your _ character , \u201d said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . \u201c I am trying to make it out . \u201d \u201c And what is your success ? \u201d She shook her head . \u201c I do not get on at all . I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . \u201d \u201c I can readily believe , \u201d answered he , gravely , \u201c that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . \u201d \u201c But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . \u201d \u201c I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , \u201d he coldly replied . She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree ; for in Darcy \u2019s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and , with an expression of civil disdain , thus accosted her,-- \u201c So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ? Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy \u2019s steward . Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy \u2019s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite \u2019s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . \u201d \u201c His guilt and his descent appear , by your account , to be the same , \u201d said Elizabeth , angrily ; \u201c for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy \u2019s steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself . \u201d \u201c I beg your pardon , \u201d replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer . \u201c Excuse my interference ; it was kindly meant . \u201d \u201c Insolent girl ! \u201d said Elizabeth to herself . \u201c You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . \u201d She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings ; and , at that moment , solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and everything else , gave way before the hope of Jane \u2019s being in the fairest way for happiness . \u201c I want to know , \u201d said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister \u2019s , \u201c what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham . But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person , in which case you may be sure of my pardon . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d replied Jane , \u201c I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister \u2019s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy \u2019s regard . \u201d \u201c Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself . \u201d \u201c No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . \u201d \u201c This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy . I am perfectly satisfied . But what does he say of the living ? \u201d \u201c He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _ conditionally _ only . \u201d \u201c I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley \u2019s sincerity , \u201d said Elizabeth warmly , \u201c but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . Mr. Bingley \u2019s defence of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . \u201d She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley \u2019s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it . On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . \u201c I have found out , \u201d said he , \u201c by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness . I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh , and of her mother , Lady Catherine . How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! Who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . \u201d \u201c You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ? \u201d \u201c Indeed I am . I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . I believe him to be Lady Catherine \u2019s _ nephew _ . It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se\u2019nnight . \u201d Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr. Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus,-- \u201c My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . You must , therefore , allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which lead me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ; \u201d and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words \u201c apology , \u201d \u201c Hunsford , \u201d and \u201c Lady Catherine de Bourgh . \u201d It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder ; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . Mr. Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr. Darcy \u2019s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech ; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way : Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth . \u201c I have no reason , I assure you , \u201d said he , \u201c to be dissatisfied with my reception . Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine \u2019s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . It was really a very handsome thought . Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . \u201d As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . She saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley \u2019s two sisters . Her mother \u2019s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley . It was an animating subject , and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane \u2019s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and , lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother \u2019s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy , who sat opposite to them . Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical . \u201c What is Mr. Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _ he _ may not like to hear . \u201d \u201c For heaven \u2019s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . \u201d Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . At length , however , Mrs. Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . Elizabeth now began to revive . But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . By many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . Elizabeth \u2019s eyes were fixed on her , with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . Mary \u2019s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in agonies . She looked at Jane to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley . She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued , however , impenetrably grave . She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . He took the hint , and , when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud,-- \u201c That will do extremely well , child . You have delighted us long enough . Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . \u201d Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her father \u2019s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . Others of the party were now applied to . \u201c If I , \u201d said Mr. Collins , \u201c were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . \u201d And with a bow to Mr. Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared -- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed , in a half - whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough ; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . She was teased by Mr. Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side ; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room . He assured her that , as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend himself to her ; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . There was no arguing upon such a project . She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good - naturedly engaged Mr. Collins \u2019s conversation to herself . She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy \u2019s further notice : though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham , and rejoiced in it . The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a man\u0153uvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation , and , by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins , who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests . Darcy said nothing at all . Mr. Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \u201c Lord , how tired I am ! \u201d accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . Bingley was all grateful pleasure ; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months . Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _ her _ , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield . [ Illustration : \u201c to assure you in the most animated language \u201d ] XIX . The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . Mr. Collins made his declaration in form . Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business . On finding Mrs. Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words,-- \u201c May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? \u201d Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise , Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,-- \u201c Oh dear ! Yes , certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you upstairs . \u201d And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out,-- \u201c Dear ma\u2019am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr. Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear . I am going away myself . \u201d \u201c No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . \u201d And upon Elizabeth \u2019s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , \u201c Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . \u201d Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction ; and a moment \u2019s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal , by incessant employment , the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Collins began,-- \u201c Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother \u2019s permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . \u201d The idea of Mr. Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued,-- \u201c My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh \u2019s footstool,--that she said , \u2018 Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake , and for your _ own _ ; let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . \u2019 Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother \u2019s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . \u201d It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . \u201c You are too hasty , sir , \u201d she cried . \u201c You forget that I have made no answer . Let me do it without further loss of time . Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . \u201d \u201c I am not now to learn , \u201d replied Mr. Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , \u201c that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . I am , therefore , by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . \u201d \u201c Upon my word , sir , \u201d cried Elizabeth , \u201c your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _ you _ so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . \u201d \u201c Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , \u201d said Mr. Collins , very gravely--\u201cbut I can not imagine that her Ladyship would at all disapprove of you . And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . \u201d \u201c Indeed , Mr. Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . \u201d And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,-- \u201c When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . \u201d \u201c Really , Mr. Collins , \u201d cried Elizabeth , with some warmth , \u201c you puzzle me exceedingly . If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . \u201d \u201c You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course . My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration that , in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . Your portion is unhappily so small , that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . As I must , therefore , conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . \u201d \u201c I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . My feelings in every respect forbid it . Can I speak plainer ? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . \u201d \u201c You are uniformly charming ! \u201d cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; \u201c and I am persuaded that , when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . \u201d To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [17, 19], "text": "Mr. Wickham"}, {"position": [31, 32], "text": "his"}, {"position": [44, 45], "text": "him"}, {"position": [86, 87],
