{"document": "X. The day passed much as the day before had done . Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and , in the evening , Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room . The loo table , however , did not appear . Mr. Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister . Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet , and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game . Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each . \u201c How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! \u201d He made no answer . \u201c You write uncommonly fast . \u201d \u201c You are mistaken . I write rather slowly . \u201d \u201c How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year ! Letters of business , too ! How odious I should think them ! \u201d \u201c It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . \u201d \u201c Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . \u201d \u201c I have already told her so once , by your desire . \u201d \u201c I am afraid you do not like your pen . Let me mend it for you . I mend pens remarkably well . \u201d \u201c Thank you -- but I always mend my own . \u201d \u201c How can you contrive to write so even ? \u201d He was silent . \u201c Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley \u2019s . \u201d \u201c Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . \u201d \u201c Oh , it is of no consequence . I shall see her in January . But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr. Darcy ? \u201d \u201c They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . \u201d \u201c It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease can not write ill . \u201d \u201c That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , \u201d cried her brother , \u201c because he does _ not _ write with ease . He studies too much for words of four syllables . Do not you , Darcy ? \u201d \u201c My style of writing is very different from yours . \u201d \u201c Oh , \u201d cried Miss Bingley , \u201c Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . \u201d \u201c My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them ; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . \u201d \u201c Your humility , Mr. Bingley , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c must disarm reproof . \u201d \u201c Nothing is more deceitful , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c than the appearance of humility . It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . \u201d \u201c And which of the two do you call _ my _ little recent piece of modesty ? \u201d \u201c The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning , that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself ; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? \u201d \u201c Nay , \u201d cried Bingley , \u201c this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . \u201d \u201c I daresay you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , \u2018 Bingley , you had better stay till next week , \u2019 you would probably do it -- you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month . \u201d \u201c You have only proved by this , \u201d cried Elizabeth , \u201c that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . You have shown him off now much more than he did himself . \u201d \u201c I am exceedingly gratified , \u201d said Bingley , \u201c by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me if , under such a circumstance , I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . \u201d \u201c Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? \u201d \u201c Upon my word , I can not exactly explain the matter -- Darcy must speak for himself . \u201d \u201c You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . \u201d \u201c To yield readily -- easily -- to the _ persuasion _ of a friend is no merit with you . \u201d \u201c To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . \u201d \u201c You appear to me , Mr. Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . But in general and ordinary cases , between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? \u201d \u201c Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? \u201d \u201c By all means , \u201d cried Bingley ; \u201c let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size , for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . \u201d Mr. Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended , and therefore checked her laugh . Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense . \u201c I see your design , Bingley , \u201d said his friend . \u201c You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . \u201d \u201c Perhaps I do . Arguments are too much like disputes . If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . \u201d \u201c What you ask , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . \u201d Mr. Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself . Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister ; and while they were thus employed , Elizabeth could not help observing , as she turned over some music - books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr. Darcy \u2019s eyes were fixed on her . She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man , and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange . She could only imagine , however , at last , that she drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . The supposition did not pain her . She liked him too little to care for his approbation . After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her,-- \u201c Do you not feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? \u201d She smiled , but made no answer . He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . \u201c Oh , \u201d said she , \u201c I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . You wanted me , I know , to say \u2018 Yes , \u2019 that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all ; and now despise me if you dare . \u201d \u201c Indeed I do not dare . \u201d Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody , and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her . He really believed that , were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . Miss Bingley saw , or suspected , enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . \u201c I hope , \u201d said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , \u201c you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , to cure the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c No , no ; stay where you are \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] \u201c Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? \u201d \u201c Oh yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . Put them next to your great - uncle the judge . They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . As for your Elizabeth \u2019s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? \u201d \u201c It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression ; but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . \u201d At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself . \u201c I did not know that you intended to walk , \u201d said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . \u201c You used us abominably ill , \u201d answered Mrs. Hurst , \u201c running away without telling us that you were coming out . \u201d Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . The path just admitted three . Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness , and immediately said,-- \u201c This walk is not wide enough for our party . We had better go into the avenue . \u201d But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered,-- \u201c No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . Good - bye . \u201d She then ran gaily off , rejoicing , as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . [ Illustration : \u201c Piling up the fire \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] XI . When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room , where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . Their powers of conversation were considerable . They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley \u2019s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation ; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was \u201c very glad ; \u201d but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley \u2019s salutation . He was full of joy and attention . The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed , at his desire , to the other side of the fireplace , that she might be farther from the door . He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to anyone else . Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight . When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table -- but in vain . She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards , and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected . She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her . Mr. Hurst had , therefore , nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep . Darcy took up a book . Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs. Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother \u2019s conversation with Miss Bennet . Miss Bingley \u2019s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy \u2019s progress through _ his _ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . She could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question and read on . At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , \u201c How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare , after all , there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . \u201d No one made any reply . She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when , hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said,-- \u201c By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . \u201d \u201c If you mean Darcy , \u201d cried her brother , \u201c he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . \u201d \u201c I should like balls infinitely better , \u201d she replied , \u201c if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . \u201d \u201c Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say ; but it would not be near so much like a ball . \u201d Miss Bingley made no answer , and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . In the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said,-- \u201c Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . \u201d Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility : Mr. Darcy looked up . He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere . What could he mean ? She was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him . \u201c Not at all , \u201d was her answer ; \u201c but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it . \u201d Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything , and persevered , therefore , in requiring an explanation of his two motives . \u201c I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , \u201d said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . \u201c You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other \u2019s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . \u201d \u201c Oh , shocking ! \u201d cried Miss Bingley . \u201c I never heard anything so abominable . How shall we punish him for such a speech ? \u201d \u201c Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c We can all plague and punish one another . Tease him -- laugh at him . Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . \u201d \u201c But upon my honour I do _ not _ . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ . Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind ! No , no ; I feel he may defy us there . And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Mr. Darcy may hug himself . \u201d \u201c Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintance . I dearly love a laugh . \u201d \u201c Miss Bingley , \u201d said he , \u201c has given me credit for more than can be . The wisest and best of men,--nay , the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . \u201d \u201c Certainly , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c there are such people , but I hope I am not one of _ them _ . I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _ do _ divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . \u201d \u201c Perhaps that is not possible for anyone . But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . \u201d \u201c Such as vanity and pride . \u201d \u201c Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind -- pride will be always under good regulation . \u201d Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . \u201c Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , \u201d said Miss Bingley ; \u201c and pray what is the result ? \u201d \u201c I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . He owns it himself without disguise . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c I have made no such pretension . I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . My temper I dare not vouch for . It is , I believe , too little yielding ; certainly too little for the convenience of the world . I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . \u201d \u201c _ That _ is a failing , indeed ! \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c Implacable resentment _ is _ a shade in a character . But you have chosen your fault well . I really can not _ laugh _ at it . You are safe from me . \u201d \u201c There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . \u201d \u201c And _ your _ defect is a propensity to hate everybody . \u201d \u201c And yours , \u201d he replied , with a smile , \u201c is wilfully to misunderstand them . \u201d \u201c Do let us have a little music , \u201d cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . \u201c Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . \u201d Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened ; and Darcy , after a few moments \u2019 recollection , was not sorry for it . He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [25, 36], "text": "the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend"}, {"position":
