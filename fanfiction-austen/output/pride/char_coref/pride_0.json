{"document": "\ufeff[Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen 1818 ] I. It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife . However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters . \u201c My dear Mr. Bennet , \u201d said his lady to him one day , \u201c have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? \u201d Mr. Bennet replied that he had not . \u201c But it is , \u201d returned she ; \u201c for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . \u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer . \u201c Do not you want to know who has taken it ? \u201d cried his wife , impatiently . \u201c _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c He came down to see the place \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] This was invitation enough . \u201c Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . \u201d \u201c What is his name ? \u201d \u201c Bingley . \u201d \u201c Is he married or single ? \u201d \u201c Oh , single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! \u201d \u201c How so ? how can it affect them ? \u201d \u201c My dear Mr. Bennet , \u201d replied his wife , \u201c how can you be so tiresome ? You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . \u201d \u201c Is that his design in settling here ? \u201d \u201c Design ? Nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . \u201d \u201c I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go -- or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better ; for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party . \u201d \u201c My dear , you flatter me . I certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . When a woman has five grown - up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . \u201d \u201c In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . \u201d \u201c But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . \u201d \u201c It is more than I engage for , I assure you . \u201d \u201c But consider your daughters . Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account ; for in general , you know , they visit no new comers . Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him , if you do not . \u201d \u201c You are over scrupulous , surely . I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls -- though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . \u201d \u201c I desire you will do no such thing . Lizzy is not a bit better than the others : and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good - humoured as Lydia . But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . \u201d \u201c They have none of them much to recommend them , \u201d replied he : \u201c they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . \u201d \u201c Mr. Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion on my poor nerves . \u201d \u201c You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . \u201d \u201c Ah , you do not know what I suffer . \u201d \u201c But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . \u201d \u201c It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . \u201d \u201c Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . \u201d Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three - and - twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . _ Her _ mind was less difficult to develope . She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . When she was discontented , she fancied herself nervous . The business of her life was to get her daughters married : its solace was visiting and news .
