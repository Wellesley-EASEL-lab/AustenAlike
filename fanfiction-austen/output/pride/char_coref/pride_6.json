{"document": "XII . In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . But Mrs. Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane \u2019s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth \u2019s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley \u2019s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow their going was deferred . Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay ; for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence : Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . She attracted him more than he liked ; and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _ her _ and more teasing than usual to himself . He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _ now _ escape him -- nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that , if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . Steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday : and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her . On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . Miss Bingley \u2019s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to . Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle ; a private had been flogged ; and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married . XIII \u201c I hope , my dear , \u201d said Mr. Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , \u201c that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . \u201d \u201c Who do you mean , my dear ? I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in ; and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her . I do not believe she often sees such at home . \u201d \u201c The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger . \u201d Mrs. Bennet \u2019s eyes sparkled . \u201c A gentleman and a stranger ! It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure . Why , Jane -- you never dropped a word of this -- you sly thing ! Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . But -- good Lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . Lydia , my love , ring the bell . I must speak to Hill this moment . \u201d \u201c It is _ not _ Mr. Bingley , \u201d said her husband ; \u201c it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . \u201d This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained:--\u201cAbout a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it ; for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . \u201d \u201c Oh , my dear , \u201d cried his wife , \u201c I can not bear to hear that mentioned . Pray do not talk of that odious man . I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure , if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . \u201d Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . They had often attempted it before : but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . \u201c It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , \u201d said Mr. Bennet ; \u201c and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . \u201d \u201c No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . I hate such false friends . Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? \u201d \u201c Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . \u201d / * RIGHT \u201c Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , _ 15th October _ . * / \u201c Dear Sir , \u201c The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness ; and , since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach : but , for some time , I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance . \u201d--\u2018There , Mrs. Bennet . \u2019--\u201cMy mind , however , is now made up on the subject ; for , having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ; but of this hereafter . If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o\u2019clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\u2019nnight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , \u201c WILLIAM COLLINS . \u201d \u201c At four o\u2019clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , \u201d said Mr. Bennet , as he folded up the letter . \u201c He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and , I doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . \u201d \u201c There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however ; and , if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . \u201d \u201c Though it is difficult , \u201d said Jane , \u201c to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . \u201d Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required . \u201c He must be an oddity , I think , \u201d said she . \u201c I can not make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? We can not suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? \u201d \u201c No , my dear ; I think not . I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter which promises well . I am impatient to see him . \u201d \u201c In point of composition , \u201d said Mary , \u201c his letter does not seem defective . The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . \u201d To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . As for their mother , Mr. Collins \u2019s letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters . Mr. Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . Mr. Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . He was a tall , heavy - looking young man of five - and - twenty . His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily,-- \u201c You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . Things are settled so oddly . \u201d \u201c You allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . \u201d \u201c Ah , sir , I do indeed . It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . Not that I mean to find fault with _ you _ , for such things , I know , are all chance in this world . There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . \u201d \u201c I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . At present I will not say more , but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted---- \u201d He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins \u2019s admiration . The hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture , were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet \u2019s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . The dinner , too , in its turn , was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing . But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet , who assured him , with some asperity , that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen . He begged pardon for having displeased her . In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 12], "text": "Elizabeth"},
