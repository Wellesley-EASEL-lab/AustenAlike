{"document": "XLIV . Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was , consequently , resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton these visitors came . They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street . Elizabeth , immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected . Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece . While these newly - born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of Elizabeth \u2019s feelings was every moment increasing . She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but , amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and , more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse . Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy . She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable . Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good - humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings . They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley \u2019s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . All Elizabeth \u2019s anger against him had been long done away ; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again . He inquired in a friendly , though general , way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done . To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . They had long wished to see him . The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , inquiry ; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . Of the lady \u2019s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough . Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre - possessed in her favour . Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner . Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival to Jane . No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it \u201c was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; \u201d and , before she could reply , he added , \u201c It is above eight months . We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . \u201d Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _ all _ her sisters were at Longbourn . There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark ; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself ; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from _ hauteur _ or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour ; and when they arose to depart , Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed . Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _ she _ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . Presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little . Eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner \u2019s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify inquiry . Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . They could not be untouched by his politeness ; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant \u2019s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy . There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant , who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight . They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit . It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well - known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged . As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _ one _ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . She certainly did not hate him . No ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good - will which could not be overlooked . It was gratitude;--gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance ; and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and , as such , its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy \u2019s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley -- for she had reached it only to a late breakfast -- ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased ; though when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon . XLV . Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley \u2019s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady \u2019s side the acquaintance would now be renewed . On reaching the house , they were shown through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . Its windows , opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . Georgiana \u2019s reception of them was very civil , but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . Mrs. Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well - bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her . She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room : she wished , she feared , that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley \u2019s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family . She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more . The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table . While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river ; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley \u2019s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over . Miss Darcy , on her brother \u2019s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility,-- \u201c Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ? They must be a great loss to _ your _ family . \u201d In Darcy \u2019s presence she dared not mention Wickham \u2019s name : but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment \u2019s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . While she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy \u2019s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy \u2019s meditated elopement . To no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley \u2019s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . He had certainly formed such a plan ; and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . Elizabeth \u2019s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair ; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully . Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth \u2019s person , behaviour , and dress . But Georgiana would not join her . Her brother \u2019s recommendation was enough to insure her favour : his judgment could not err ; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . \u201c How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , \u201d she cried : \u201c I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . She is grown so brown and coarse ! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . \u201d However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . \u201c For my own part , \u201d she rejoined , \u201c I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them . They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . \u201d Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected . He was resolutely silent , however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued,-- \u201c I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , \u2018 _ She _ a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . \u2019 But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , \u201c but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . \u201d He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of everything but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece \u2019s beginning the subject .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [7, 9], "text": "Mr. Darcy"}, {"position": [11, 12], "text": "his"}, {"position": [282, 284],
