{"document": "IV . When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . \u201c He is just what a young - man ought to be , \u201d said she , \u201c sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! \u201d \u201c He is also handsome , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can . His character is thereby complete . \u201d \u201c I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . I did not expect such a compliment . \u201d \u201c Did not you ? _ I _ did for you . But that is one great difference between us . Compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . What could be more natural than his asking you again ? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . No thanks to his gallantry for that . Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . You have liked many a stupider person . \u201d \u201c Dear Lizzy ! \u201d \u201c Oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . You never see a fault in anybody . All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . \u201d \u201c I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but I always speak what I think . \u201d \u201c I know you do : and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . With _ your _ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets with it everywhere . But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the good of everybody \u2019s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad,--belongs to you alone . And so , you like this man \u2019s sisters , too , do you ? Their manners are not equal to his . \u201d \u201c Certainly not , at first ; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . \u201d Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced : their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment , too , unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . They were , in fact , very fine ladies ; not deficient in good - humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . They were rather handsome ; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town ; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds ; were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were , therefore , in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others . They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother \u2019s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr. Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but , as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table ; nor was Mrs. Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted , by an accidental recommendation , to look at Netherfield House . He did look at it , and into it , for half an hour ; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , and ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . On the strength of Darcy \u2019s regard , Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . In understanding , Darcy was the superior . Bingley was by no means deficient ; but Darcy was clever . He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious ; and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared ; Darcy was continually giving offence . The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him ; there had been no formality , no stiffness ; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty ; but she smiled too much . Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so ; but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl ; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose . V. Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate . Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune , and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty . The distinction had , perhaps , been felt too strongly . It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and , quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge ; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . For , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody . By nature inoffensive , friendly , and obliging , his presentation at St. James \u2019s had made him courteous . Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet . They had several children . The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was Elizabeth \u2019s intimate friend . That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . \u201c _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , with civil self - command , to Miss Lucas . \u201c _ You _ were Mr. Bingley \u2019s first choice . \u201d \u201c Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . \u201d \u201c Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice . To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her -- indeed , I rather believe he _ did_--I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . \u201d \u201c Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson : did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson \u2019s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , \u2018 Oh , the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided , indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . \u201d \u201c _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Eliza , \u201d said Charlotte . \u201c Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just _ tolerable _ . \u201d \u201c I beg you will not put it into Lizzy \u2019s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c Without once opening his lips \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] \u201c Are you quite sure , ma\u2019am ? Is not there a little mistake ? \u201d said Jane . \u201c I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . \u201d \u201c Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . \u201d \u201c Miss Bingley told me , \u201d said Jane , \u201c that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . With _ them _ he is remarkably agreeable . \u201d \u201c I do not believe a word of it , my dear . If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long . But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise . \u201d \u201c I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , \u201d said Miss Lucas , \u201c but I wish he had danced with Eliza . \u201d \u201c Another time , Lizzy , \u201d said her mother , \u201c I would not dance with _ him _ , if I were you . \u201d \u201c I believe , ma\u2019am , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . \u201d \u201c His pride , \u201d said Miss Lucas , \u201c does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . One can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . If I may so express it , he has a _ right _ to be proud . \u201d \u201c That is very true , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . \u201d \u201c Pride , \u201d observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , \u201c is a very common failing , I believe . By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . A person may be proud without being vain . Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves ; vanity to what we would have others think of us . \u201d \u201c If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , \u201d cried a young Lucas , who came with his sisters , \u201c I should not care how proud I was . I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . \u201d \u201c Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet ; \u201c and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . \u201d The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would ; and the argument ended only with the visit .",
