{"document": "XIV During dinner , Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . Lady Catherine de Bourgh \u2019s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better . Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise . The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner ; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people , he knew , but _ he _ had never seen anything but affability in her . She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations . She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs . \u201c That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , \u201c and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . Does she live near you , sir ? \u201d \u201c The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her Ladyship \u2019s residence . \u201d \u201c I think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? \u201d \u201c She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . \u201d \u201c Ah , \u201d cried Mrs. Bennet , shaking her head , \u201c then she is better off than many girls . And what sort of young lady is she ? Is she handsome ? \u201d \u201c She is a most charming young lady , indeed . Lady Catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of , as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . \u201d \u201c Has she been presented ? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . \u201d \u201c Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British Court of its brightest ornament . Her Ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess ; and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . \u201d \u201c You judge very properly , \u201d said Mr. Bennet ; \u201c and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? \u201d \u201c They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time ; and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . \u201d Mr. Bennet \u2019s expectations were fully answered . His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped ; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and , except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . By tea - time , however , the dose had been enough , and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him [ Illustration : \u201c Protested that he never read novels \u201d H.T Feb 94 ] to read aloud to the ladies . Mr. Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it ( for everything announced it to be from a circulating library ) he started back , and , begging pardon , protested that he never read novels . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose \u201c Fordyce \u2019s Sermons . \u201d Lydia gaped as he opened the volume ; and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with,-- \u201c Do you know , mamma , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard ? and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town . \u201d Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr. Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said,-- \u201c I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . It amazes me , I confess ; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . But I will no longer importune my young cousin . \u201d Then , turning to Mr. Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon . Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia \u2019s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr. Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill - will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . XV . Mr. Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance . The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner ; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his right as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility . Having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to choose one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . This was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father \u2019s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . His plan did not vary on seeing them . Miss Bennet \u2019s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _ she _ was his settled choice . The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour \u2019s _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . \u201c As to her _ younger _ daughters , she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _ know _ of any prepossession;--her _ eldest _ daughter she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . \u201d Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire . Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces . Lydia \u2019s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten : every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr. Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr. Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr. Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford . Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly . In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there : his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _ him _ . Their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet , indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recall them . But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentlemanlike appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . All were struck with the stranger \u2019s air , all wondered who he could be ; and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement , when the two gentlemen , turning back , had reached the same spot . Mr. Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr. Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and , he was happy to say , had accepted a commission in their corps . This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . His appearance was greatly in his favour : he had all the best parts of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street . On distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object . He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger ; and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . Mr. Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return . What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . In another minute Mr. Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips \u2019s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia \u2019s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs. Philips \u2019s throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation . Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces ; and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome ; and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones \u2019s shopboy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield , because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane \u2019s introduction of him . She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologizing for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself , however , might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr. Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant \u2019s commission in the ----shire . She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become \u201c stupid , disagreeable fellows . \u201d Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening . This was agreed to ; and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured , with unwearying civility , that they were perfectly needless . As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips \u2019s manners and politeness . He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before . Something , he supposed , might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position":
