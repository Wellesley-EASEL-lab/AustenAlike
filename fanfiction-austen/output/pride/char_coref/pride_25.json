{"document": "L. Mr. Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him . He now wished it more than ever . Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place . He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother - in - law ; and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . When first Mr. Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . This son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . Five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs. Bennet , for many years after Lydia \u2019s birth , had been certain that he would . This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy ; and her husband \u2019s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income . Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children . But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents . This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him . He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement . He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother \u2019s hands , Lydia \u2019s expenses had been very little within that sum . That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . His letter was soon despatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution . He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her . The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood . It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . To be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world in some distant farm - house . But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such a husband her misery was considered certain . It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph . The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants . She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter ; and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . \u201c Haye Park might do , \u201d said she , \u201c if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off . I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . \u201d Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained . But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , \u201c Mrs. Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . Into _ one _ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . I will not encourage the imprudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . \u201d A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr. Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and Mrs. Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion . Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it . That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible . She was more alive to the disgrace , which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter \u2019s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place . Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot . She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister \u2019s frailty would have mortified her so much . Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself ; for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them . Had Lydia \u2019s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . She was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . She was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet . What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both : by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved ; and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was . An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine . But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . To Mr. Bennet \u2019s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . \u201c It was greatly my wish that he should do so , \u201d he added , \u201c as soon as his marriage was fixed on . And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece \u2019s . It is Mr. Wickham \u2019s intention to go into the Regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General---- \u2019s regiment , now quartered in the north . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information ? He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Yours , etc . \u201c E. GARDINER . \u201d Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham \u2019s removal from the ----shire , as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do . But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it . Lydia \u2019s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites . \u201c She is so fond of Mrs. Forster , \u201d said she , \u201c it will be quite shocking to send her away ! And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . The officers may not be so pleasant in General---- \u2019s regiment . \u201d His daughter \u2019s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister \u2019s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north . When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that , as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme ; and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . LI . Their sister \u2019s wedding - day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . The carriage was sent to meet them at---- , and they were to return in it by dinnertime . Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets -- and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _ she _ been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure . They came . The family were assembled in the breakfast - room to receive them . Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . Lydia \u2019s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness . Their reception from Mr. Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . His countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips . The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . Lydia was Lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless . She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself ; but his manners were always so pleasing , that , had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man . _ She _ blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour . There was no want of discourse . The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good - humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . \u201c Only think of its being three months , \u201d she cried , \u201c since I went away : it seems but a fortnight , I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . Good gracious ! when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . \u201d Her father lifted up his eyes , Jane was distressed , Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued,-- \u201c Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ? I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like anything . \u201d Elizabeth could bear it no longer . She got up and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour . She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother \u2019s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister,-- \u201c Ah , Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . \u201d It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first . Her ease and good spirits increased . She longed to see Mrs. Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called \u201c Mrs. Wickham \u201d by each of them ; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids . \u201c Well , mamma , \u201d said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast - room , \u201c and what do you think of my husband ? Is not he a charming man ? I am sure my sisters must all envy me . I only hope they may have half my good luck . They must all go to Brighton . That is the place to get husbands . What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go ! \u201d \u201c Very true ; and if I had my will we should . But , my dear Lydia , I do n\u2019t at all like your going such a way off . Must it be so ? \u201d \u201c Oh , Lord ! yes ; there is nothing in that . I shall like it of all things . You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . \u201d \u201c I should like it beyond anything ! \u201d said her mother . \u201c And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . \u201d \u201c I thank you for my share of the favour , \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . \u201d Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not . Wickham \u2019s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia \u2019s for him . She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . He did everything best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September than anybody else in the country . One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth,-- \u201c Lizzy , I never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , I believe . You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? \u201d \u201c No , really , \u201d replied Elizabeth ; \u201c I think there can not be too little said on the subject . \u201d \u201c La ! You are so strange ! But I must tell you how it went off . We were married , you know , at St. Clement \u2019s , because Wickham \u2019s lodgings were in that parish . And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o\u2019clock . My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . \u201c Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . \u201c Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual : I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . If you \u2019ll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . Not one party , or scheme , or anything ! To be sure , London was rather thin , but , however , the Little Theatre was open . \u201c Well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone . And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes \u2019 time , and then we all set out . However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . \u201d \u201c Mr. Darcy ! \u201d repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . \u201c Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . But , gracious me ! I quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it . I promised them so faithfully ! What will Wickham say ? It was to be such a secret ! \u201d \u201c If it was to be a secret , \u201d said Jane , \u201c say not another word on the subject . You may depend upon my seeking no further . \u201d \u201c Oh , certainly , \u201d said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; \u201c we will ask you no questions . \u201d \u201c Thank you , \u201d said Lydia ; \u201c for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . \u201d On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . Mr. Darcy had been at her sister \u2019s wedding . It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropped , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . \u201c You may readily comprehend , \u201d she added , \u201c what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . \u201d \u201c Not that I _ shall _ , though , \u201d she added to herself , and she finished the letter ; \u201c and , my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . \u201d Jane \u2019s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [0, 3], "text": "L.
