{"document": "II . Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley . He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it . It was then disclosed in the following manner . Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with,-- \u201c I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . \u201d \u201c We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , \u201d said her mother , resentfully , \u201c since we are not to visit . \u201d \u201c But you forget , mamma , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . \u201d \u201c I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . \u201d \u201c No more have I , \u201d said Mr. Bennet ; \u201c and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . \u201d Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but , unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . \u201c Do n\u2019t keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven \u2019s sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . \u201d \u201c Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , \u201d said her father ; \u201c she times them ill . \u201d \u201c I do not cough for my own amusement , \u201d replied Kitty , fretfully . \u201c When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? \u201d \u201c To - morrow fortnight . \u201d \u201c Ay , so it is , \u201d cried her mother , \u201c and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . \u201d \u201c Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . \u201d \u201c Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? \u201d \u201c I honour your circumspection . A fortnight \u2019s acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . \u201d The girls stared at their father . Mrs. Bennet said only , \u201c Nonsense , nonsense ! \u201d \u201c What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? \u201d cried he . \u201c Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you _ there _ . What say you , Mary ? For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books , and make extracts . \u201d Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . \u201c While Mary is adjusting her ideas , \u201d he continued , \u201c let us return to Mr. Bingley . \u201d \u201c I am sick of Mr. Bingley , \u201d cried his wife . \u201c I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did you not tell me so before ? If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . \u201d The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished -- that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . \u201c How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! And it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . \u201d \u201c Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , \u201d said Mr. Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . \u201c What an excellent father you have , girls , \u201d said she , when the door was shut . \u201c I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . At our time of life , it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes we would do anything . Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . \u201d \u201c Oh , \u201d said Lydia , stoutly , \u201c I am not afraid ; for though I _ am _ the youngest , I \u2019m the tallest . \u201d The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet \u2019s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . [ Illustration : \u201c He rode a black horse \u201d ] III . Not all that Mrs. Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject , was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley . They attacked him in various ways , with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour , Lady Lucas . Her report was highly favourable . Sir William had been delighted with him . He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and , to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . Nothing could be more delightful ! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley \u2019s heart were entertained . \u201c If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet to her husband , \u201c and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . \u201d In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet \u2019s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining , from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse . An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched ; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , etc . Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted . She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might always be flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his [ Illustration : \u201c When the Party entered \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that , instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . And when the party entered the assembly - room , it consisted of only five altogether : Mr. Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . Mr. Bingley was good - looking and gentlemanlike : he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . His brother - in - law , Mr. Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien , and the report , which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room : he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . What a contrast between him and his friend ! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . His character was decided . He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and everybody hoped that he would never come there again . Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters . Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it . \u201c Come , Darcy , \u201d said he , \u201c I must have you dance . I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . You had much better dance . \u201d \u201c I certainly shall not . You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . \u201d \u201c I would not be so fastidious as you are , \u201d cried Bingley , \u201c for a kingdom ! Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . \u201d \u201c _ You _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , \u201d said Mr. Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . \u201c Oh , she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable . Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c She is tolerable \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] \u201c Which do you mean ? \u201d and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till , catching her eye , he withdrew his own , and coldly said , \u201c She is tolerable : but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . \u201d Mr. Bingley followed his advice . Mr. Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . She told the story , however , with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in anything ridiculous . The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be , though in a quieter way . Elizabeth felt Jane \u2019s pleasure . Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . They returned , therefore , in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . They found Mr. Bennet still up . With a book , he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . He had rather hoped that all his wife \u2019s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . \u201c Oh , my dear Mr. Bennet , \u201d as she entered the room , \u201c we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . I wish you had been there . Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . Only think of _ that _ , my dear : he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the _ Boulanger_---- \u201d \u201c If he had had any compassion for _ me _ , \u201d cried her husband impatiently , \u201c he would not have danced half so much ! For God \u2019s sake , say no more of his partners . O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! \u201d \u201c Oh , my dear , \u201d continued Mrs. Bennet , \u201c I am quite delighted with him . He is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women . I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst \u2019s gown---- \u201d Here she was interrupted again . Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery . She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit , and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy . \u201c But I can assure you , \u201d she added , \u201c that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . So high and so conceited , that there was no enduring him ! He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! Not handsome enough to dance with ! I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs . I quite detest the man . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 4], "text": "Mr. Bennet"}, {"position": [13, 15], "text": "Mr. Bingley"}, {"position": [16, 17], "text": "He"},
