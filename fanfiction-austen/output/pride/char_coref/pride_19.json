{"document": "XXXVIII . On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary . \u201c I know not , Miss Elizabeth , \u201d said he , \u201c whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly . \u201d Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attention she had received , must make _ her _ feel the obliged . Mr. Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,-- \u201c It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine \u2019s family is , indeed , the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth , I must acknowledge , that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . \u201d Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences . \u201c You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . I flatter myself , at least , that you will be able to do so . Lady Catherine \u2019s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . We seem to have been designed for each other . \u201d Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add , that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang . Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms . At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins ; and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , though unknown . He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . \u201c But , \u201d he added , \u201c you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . \u201d Elizabeth made no objection : the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . \u201c Good gracious ! \u201d cried Maria , after a few minutes \u2019 silence , \u201c it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! \u201d \u201c A great many indeed , \u201d said her companion , with a sigh . \u201c We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! \u201d Elizabeth privately added , \u201c And how much I shall have to conceal ! \u201d Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner \u2019s house , where they were to remain a few days . Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . It was not without an effort , meanwhile , that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy \u2019s proposals . To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister further . XXXIX . It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ---- , in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet \u2019s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman \u2019s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room upstairs . These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a salad and cucumber . After welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , \u201c Is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? \u201d \u201c And we mean to treat you all , \u201d added Lydia ; \u201c but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . \u201d Then showing her purchases,--\u201cLook here , I have bought this bonnet . I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . \u201d And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , \u201c Oh , but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ----shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . \u201d \u201c Are they , indeed ? \u201d cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . \u201c They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all . Mamma would like to go , too , of all things ! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d thought Elizabeth ; \u201c _ that _ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . Good Heaven ! Brighton and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton ! \u201d \u201c Now I have got some news for you , \u201d said Lydia , as they sat down to table . \u201c What do you think ? It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . \u201d Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . Lydia laughed , and said,-- \u201c Ay , that is just like your formality and discretion . You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . But he is an ugly fellow ! I am glad he is gone . I never saw such a long chin in my life . Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? There is no danger of Wickham \u2019s marrying Mary King -- there \u2019s for you ! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay . Wickham is safe . \u201d \u201c And Mary King is safe ! \u201d added Elizabeth ; \u201c safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . \u201d \u201c She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . \u201d \u201c But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , \u201d said Jane . \u201c I am sure there is not on _ his _ . I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her . Who _ could _ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? \u201d Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _ expression _ herself , the coarseness of the _ sentiment _ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal ! As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and , after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty \u2019s and Lydia \u2019s purchases , were seated in it . \u201c How nicely we are crammed in ! \u201d cried Lydia . \u201c I am glad I brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band - box ! Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away . Have you seen any pleasant men ? Have you had any flirting ? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . She is almost three - and - twenty ! Lord ! how ashamed I should be of not being married before three - and - twenty ! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands you ca n\u2019t think . She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but _ I _ do not think there would have been any fun in it . Lord ! how I should like to be married before any of you ! and then I would _ chaperon _ you about to all the balls . Dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster \u2019s ! Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by - the - bye , Mrs. Forster and me are _ such _ friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come : but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman \u2019s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun ! Not a soul knew of it , but Colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . Lord ! how I laughed ! and so did Mrs. Forster . I thought I should have died . And _ that _ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . \u201d With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia , assisted by Kitty \u2019s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham \u2019s name . Their reception at home was most kind . Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,---- \u201c I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . \u201d Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person \u2019s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . \u201c Oh , Mary , \u201d said she , \u201c I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . And then when we came away it was such fun ! I thought we never should have got into the coach . I was ready to die of laughter . And then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ! \u201d To this , Mary very gravely replied , \u201c Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . But I confess they would have no charms for _ me _ . I should infinitely prefer a book . \u201d But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton , and see how everybody went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . There was another reason , too , for her opposition . She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . The comfort to _ her _ , of the regiment \u2019s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [7, 9], "text": "Mr. Collins"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text": "he"}, {"position": [31, 32], "text": "he"},
