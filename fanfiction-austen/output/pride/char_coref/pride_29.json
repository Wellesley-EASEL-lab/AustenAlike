{"document": "LVIII . Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine \u2019s visit . The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . It was agreed to . Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them . They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy were to entertain each other . Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and , perhaps , he might be doing the same . They walked towards the Lucases \u2019 , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone . Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed ; and while her courage was high , she immediately said,-- \u201c Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours . I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . Were it known to the rest of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . \u201d \u201c I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , \u201d replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , \u201c that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . \u201d \u201c You must not blame my aunt . Lydia \u2019s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . \u201d \u201c If you _ will _ thank me , \u201d he replied , \u201c let it be for yourself alone . That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . But your _ family _ owe me nothing . Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of _ you _ . \u201d Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . After a short pause , her companion added , \u201c You are too generous to trifle with me . If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . _ My _ affections and wishes are unchanged ; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . \u201d Elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances . The happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him : but though she could not look she could listen ; and he told her of feelings which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . They walked on without knowing in what direction . There was too much to be thought , and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _ did _ call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her Ladyship \u2019s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _ she _ had refused to give . But , unluckily for her Ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise . \u201c It taught me to hope , \u201d said he , \u201c as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly . \u201d Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , \u201c Yes , you know enough of my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that _ . After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . \u201d \u201c What did you say of me that I did not deserve ? For though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . It was unpardonable . I can not think of it without abhorrence . \u201d \u201c We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then we have both , I hope , improved in civility . \u201d \u201c I can not be so easily reconciled to myself . The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : \u2018 Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . \u2019 Those were your words . You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . \u201d \u201c I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . \u201d \u201c I can easily believe it . You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . \u201d \u201c Oh , do not repeat what I then said . These recollections will not do at all . I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . \u201d Darcy mentioned his letter . \u201c Did it , \u201d said he,--\u201cdid it _ soon _ make you think better of me ? Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? \u201d She explained what its effects on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . \u201c I knew , \u201d said he , \u201c that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . I hope you have destroyed the letter . There was one part , especially the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . \u201d \u201c The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . \u201d \u201c When I wrote that letter , \u201d replied Darcy , \u201c I believed myself perfectly calm and cool ; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . \u201d \u201c The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . The adieu is charity itself . But think no more of the letter . The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . You must learn some of my philosophy . Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . \u201d \u201c I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . _ Your _ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of ignorance . But with _ me _ , it is not so . Painful recollections will intrude , which can not , which ought not to be repelled . I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only _ child _ ) , I was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _ wish _ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight - and - twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . By you , I was properly humbled . I came to you without a doubt of my reception . You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . \u201d \u201c Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? \u201d \u201c Indeed I had . What will you think of my vanity ? I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . \u201d \u201c My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I assure you . I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . How you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ! \u201d \u201c Hate you ! I was angry , perhaps , at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . \u201d \u201c I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley . You blamed me for coming ? \u201d \u201c No , indeed , I felt nothing but surprise . \u201d \u201c Your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you . My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . \u201d \u201c My object _ then _ , \u201d replied Darcy , \u201c was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . How soon any other wishes introduced themselves , I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . \u201d He then told her of Georgiana \u2019s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther . After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know anything about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home . \u201c What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ? \u201d was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _ their _ affairs . Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . \u201c I must ask whether you were surprised ? \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c Not at all . When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . \u201d \u201c That is to say , you had given your permission . I guessed as much . \u201d And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case . \u201c On the evening before my going to London , \u201d said he , \u201c I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . His surprise was great . He had never had the slightest suspicion . I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . \u201d Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . \u201c Did you speak from your own observation , \u201d said she , \u201c when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? \u201d \u201c From the former . I had narrowly observed her , during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . \u201d \u201c And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . \u201d \u201c It did . Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made everything easy . I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . He was angry . But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister \u2019s sentiments . He has heartily forgiven me now . \u201d Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin . In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . In the hall they parted . LIX . \u201c My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? \u201d was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge . She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . The evening passed quietly , unmarked by anything extraordinary . The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed ; the unacknowledged were silent . Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known : she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _ dislike _ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . At night she opened her heart to Jane . Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet \u2019s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . \u201c You are joking , Lizzy . This can not be ! Engaged to Mr. Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . \u201d \u201c This is a wretched beginning , indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . I speak nothing but the truth . He still loves me , and we are engaged . \u201d Jane looked at her doubtingly . \u201c Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be . I know how much you dislike him . \u201d \u201c You know nothing of the matter . _ That _ is all to be forgot . Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable . This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . \u201d Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . Elizabeth again , and more seriously , assured her of its truth . \u201c Good heaven ! can it be really so ? Yet now I must believe you , \u201d cried Jane . \u201c My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? \u201d \u201c There can be no doubt of that . It is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . But are you pleased , Jane ? Shall you like to have such a brother ? \u201d \u201c Very , very much . Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . And do you really love him quite well enough ? Oh , Lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection . Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? \u201d \u201c Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do when I tell you all . \u201d \u201c What do you mean ? \u201d \u201c Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . I am afraid you will be angry . \u201d \u201c My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious . I want to talk very seriously . Let me know everything that I am to know without delay . Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? \u201d \u201c It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began ; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . \u201d Another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish . \u201c Now I am quite happy , \u201d said she , \u201c for you will be as happy as myself . I always had a value for him . Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley \u2019s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . But , Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . \u201d Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend : but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia \u2019s marriage . All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . \u201c Good gracious ! \u201d cried Mrs. Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , \u201c if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . What shall we do with him ? Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley \u2019s way . \u201d Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , \u201c Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? \u201d \u201c I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , \u201c to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . \u201d \u201c It may do very well for the others , \u201d replied Mr. Bingley ; \u201c but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . Wo n\u2019t it , Kitty ? \u201d Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . As she went upstairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying,-- \u201c I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it . It is all for Jane \u2019s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . \u201d During their walk , it was resolved that Mr. Bennet \u2019s consent should be asked in the course of the evening : Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother \u2019s . She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man ; but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation . In the evening , soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . She did not fear her father \u2019s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means ; that _ she _ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , \u201c Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . \u201d She was gone directly . Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . \u201c Lizzy , \u201d said he , \u201c what are you doing ? Are you out of your senses to be accepting this man ? Have not you always hated him ? \u201d How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr. Darcy . \u201c Or , in other words , you are determined to have him . He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . But will they make you happy ? \u201d \u201c Have you any other objection , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c than your belief of my indifference ? \u201d \u201c None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . \u201d \u201c I do , I do like him , \u201d she replied , with tears in her eyes ; \u201c I love him . Indeed he has no improper pride . He is perfectly amiable . You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . \u201d \u201c Lizzy , \u201d said her father , \u201c I have given him my consent . He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask . I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . But let me advise you to think better of it . I know your disposition , Lizzy . I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior . Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . My child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life . You know not what you are about . \u201d Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and , at length , by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months \u2019 suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father \u2019s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . \u201c Well , my dear , \u201d said he , when she ceased speaking , \u201c I have no more to say . If this be the case , he deserves you . I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . \u201d To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . He heard her with astonishment . \u201c This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! And so , Darcy did everything ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow \u2019s debts , and got him his commission ! So much the better . It will save me a world of trouble and economy . Had it been your uncle \u2019s doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way . I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . \u201d He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading Mr. Collins \u2019s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go , saying , as she quitted the room , \u201c If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . \u201d Elizabeth \u2019s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour \u2019s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . Everything was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . When her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . Its effect was most extraordinary ; for , on first hearing it , Mrs. Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard , though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . \u201c Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr. Darcy ! Who would have thought it ? And is it really true ? Oh , my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane \u2019s is nothing to it -- nothing at all . I am so pleased -- so happy . Such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before . I hope he will overlook it . Dear , dear Lizzy . A house in town ! Everything that is charming ! Three daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! what will become of me ? I shall go distracted . \u201d This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted ; and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . \u201c My dearest child , \u201d she cried , \u201c I can think of nothing else . Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! \u2019 Tis as good as a lord ! And a special licence -- you must and shall be married by a special licence . But , my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . \u201d This was a sad omen of what her mother \u2019s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations \u2019 consent , there was still something to be wished for . But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . \u201c I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , \u201d said he . \u201c Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane \u2019s . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions":
