{"document": "XXX . Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter \u2019s being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . While Sir William was with them , Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and showing him the country : but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration ; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . The room in which the ladies sat was backwards . Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect : but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . From the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes \u2019 conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins \u2019s joints of meat were too large for her family . Elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty . [ Illustration : \u201c he never failed to inform them \u201d ] The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card - table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first . Their other engagements were few , as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses \u2019 reach . This , however , was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough : there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine \u2019s curiosity . In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . Elizabeth had heard , soon after her arrival , that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks ; and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley \u2019s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage ; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have [ Illustration : \u201c The gentlemen accompanied him . \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] the earliest assurance of it ; and , after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence . On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord ---- ; and , to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr. Collins returned , the gentlemen accompanied him . Charlotte had seen them from her husband \u2019s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding,-- \u201c I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . \u201d Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs. Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . Elizabeth merely courtesied to him , without saying a word . Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly , with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins , sat for some time without speaking to anybody . At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . She answered him in the usual way ; and , after a moment \u2019s pause , added,-- \u201c My eldest sister has been in town these three months . Have you never happened to see her there ? \u201d She was perfectly sensible that he never had : but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . The subject was pursued no further , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . [ Illustration : \u201c At Church \u201d ] XXXI . Colonel Fitzwilliam \u2019s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen \u2019s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church . The invitation was accepted , of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine \u2019s drawing - room . Her Ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them : anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs. Collins \u2019s pretty friend had , moreover , caught his fancy very much . He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy . _ His _ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her Ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out,-- \u201c What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? What is it you are talking of ? What are you telling Miss Bennet ? Let me hear what it is . \u201d \u201c We were talking of music , madam , \u201d said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . \u201c Of music ! Then pray speak aloud . It is of all subjects my delight . I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? \u201d Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister \u2019s proficiency . \u201c I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , \u201d said Lady Catherine ; \u201c and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . \u201d \u201c I assure you , madam , \u201d he replied , \u201c that she does not need such advice . She practises very constantly . \u201d \u201c So much the better . It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson \u2019s room . She would be in nobody \u2019s way , you know , in that part of the house . \u201d Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt \u2019s ill - breeding , and made no answer . When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . He drew a chair near her . Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer \u2019s countenance . Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile , and said,-- \u201c You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me . But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well . There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . \u201d \u201c I shall not say that you are mistaken , \u201d he replied , \u201c because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . \u201d Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , \u201c Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . \u201d \u201c I am not afraid of you , \u201d said he , smilingly . \u201c Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , \u201d cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . \u201c I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . \u201d \u201c You shall hear , then -- but prepare for something very dreadful . The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? He danced only four dances ! I am sorry to pain you , but so it was . He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact . \u201d \u201c I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . \u201d \u201c True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball - room . Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? My fingers wait your orders . \u201d \u201c Perhaps , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c I should have judged better had I sought an introduction , but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . \u201d \u201c Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? \u201d said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . \u201c Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill - qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? \u201d \u201c I can answer your question , \u201d said Fitzwilliam , \u201c without applying to him . It is because he will not give himself the trouble . \u201d \u201c I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . \u201d \u201c My fingers , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women \u2019s do . They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman \u2019s of superior execution . \u201d Darcy smiled and said , \u201c You are perfectly right . You have employed your time much better . No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . We neither of us perform to strangers . \u201d Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . Elizabeth immediately began playing again . Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy,-- \u201c Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne \u2019s . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . \u201d Elizabeth looked at Darcy , to see how cordially he assented to his cousin \u2019s praise : but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _ her _ , had she been his relation . Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth \u2019s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste . Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship \u2019s carriage was ready to take them all home .",
