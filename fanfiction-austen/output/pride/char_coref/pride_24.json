{"document": "XLVIII . The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . His family knew him to be , on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent ; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion . They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send ; but even of _ that _ they would have been glad to be certain . Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on ; and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband \u2019s not being killed in a duel . Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces . She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet , and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom . Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up -- though , as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham \u2019s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them . All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman \u2019s family . Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness . Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister \u2019s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when , if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him : it told them , that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street . That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure ; but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . He added , that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . There was also a postscript to this effect:-- \u201c I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man \u2019s intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . If there were anyone that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person . \u201d Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved . She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information ; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning \u2019s impatience . Through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated ; and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr. Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . It was as follows:-- / * \u201c My dear Sir , * / \u201c I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be , of all others , most afflicting to a parent \u2019s mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others : for who , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? And this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . Let me advise you , then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . \u201c I am , dear sir , \u201d etc . , etc . Mr. Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . There was no one , therefore , who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him . And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia \u2019s relations ; for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount . Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton . He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . \u201c A gamester ! \u201d she cried . \u201c This is wholly unexpected ; I had not an idea of it . \u201d Mr. Gardiner added , in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . Rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother - in - law \u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . When Mrs. Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . \u201c What ! is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ? \u201d she cried . \u201c Sure he will not leave London before he has found them . Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? \u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it . The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _ that_,--though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia \u2019s infamy somewhat better . It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two . When Mr. Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure . He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away ; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , \u201c Say nothing of that . Who should suffer but myself ? It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . \u201d \u201c You must not be too severe upon yourself , \u201d replied Elizabeth . \u201c You may well warn me against such an evil . Human nature is so prone to fall into it ! No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . It will pass away soon enough . \u201d \u201c Do you suppose them to be in London ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? \u201d \u201c And Lydia used to want to go to London , \u201d added Kitty . \u201c She is happy , then , \u201d said her father , drily ; \u201c and her residence there will probably be of some duration . \u201d Then , after a short silence , he continued , \u201c Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . \u201d They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother \u2019s tea . \u201c This is a parade , \u201d cried he , \u201c which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away . \u201d \u201c I am not going to run away , papa , \u201d said Kitty , fretfully . \u201c If _ I _ should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . \u201d \u201c _ You _ go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne , for fifty pounds ! No , Kitty , I have at least learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . \u201d Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry . \u201c Well , well , \u201d said he , \u201c do not make yourself unhappy . If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . \u201d XLIX . Two days after Mr. Bennet \u2019s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , \u201c I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . \u201d \u201c What do you mean , Hill ? We have heard nothing from town . \u201d \u201c Dear madam , \u201d cried Mrs. Hill , in great astonishment , \u201c do n\u2019t you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner ? He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . \u201d Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast - room ; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said,-- \u201c If you are looking for my master , ma\u2019am , he is walking towards the little copse . \u201d Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out,-- \u201c Oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . \u201d \u201c Well , and what news does it bring -- good or bad ? \u201d \u201c What is there of good to be expected ? \u201d said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; \u201c but perhaps you would like to read it . \u201d Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . Jane now came up . \u201c Read it aloud , \u201d said their father , \u201c for I hardly know myself what it is about . \u201d / * RIGHT \u201c Gracechurch Street , _ Monday , August 2 _ . * / \u201c My dear Brother , \u201c At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . The particulars I reserve till we meet . It is enough to know they are discovered : I have seen them both---- \u201d \u201c Then it is as I always hoped , \u201d cried Jane : \u201c they are married ! \u201d Elizabeth read on : \u201c I have seen them both . They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . These are conditions which , considering everything , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham \u2019s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . She comes to us to - day . I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . Yours , etc . \u201c EDW . GARDINER . \u201d \u201c Is it possible ? \u201d cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . \u201c Can it be possible that he will marry her ? \u201d \u201c Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , \u201d said her sister . \u201c My dear father , I congratulate you . \u201d \u201c And have you answered the letter ? \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c No ; but it must be done soon . \u201d Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . \u201c Oh ! my dear father , \u201d she cried , \u201c come back and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is in such a case . \u201d \u201c Let me write for you , \u201d said Jane , \u201c if you dislike the trouble yourself . \u201d \u201c I dislike it very much , \u201d he replied ; \u201c but it must be done . \u201d And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . \u201c And -- may I ask ? \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . \u201d \u201c Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . \u201d \u201c And they _ must _ marry ! Yet he is _ such _ a man . \u201d \u201c Yes , yes , they must marry . There is nothing else to be done . But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . \u201d \u201c Money ! my uncle ! \u201d cried Jane , \u201c what do you mean , sir ? \u201d \u201c I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . \u201d \u201c That is very true , \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh , it must be my uncle \u2019s doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said her father . \u201c Wickham \u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds : I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . \u201d \u201c Ten thousand pounds ! Heaven forbid ! How is half such a sum to be repaid ? \u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer ; and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast - room . \u201c And they are really to be married ! \u201d cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . \u201c How strange this is ! and for _ this _ we are to be thankful . That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! Oh , Lydia ! \u201d \u201c I comfort myself with thinking , \u201d replied Jane , \u201c that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . He has children of his own , and may have more . How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? \u201d \u201c If we are ever able to learn what Wickham \u2019s debts have been , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! \u201d \u201c We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , \u201d said Jane : \u201c I hope and trust they will yet be happy . His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . \u201d \u201c Their conduct has been such , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c as neither you , nor I , nor anybody , can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it . \u201d It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied,-- \u201c Just as you please . \u201d \u201c May we take my uncle \u2019s letter to read to her ? \u201d \u201c Take whatever you like , and get away . \u201d Elizabeth took the letter from his writing - table , and they went upstairs together . Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all . After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud . Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself . As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner \u2019s hope of Lydia \u2019s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance . She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation . To know that her daughter would be married was enough . She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . \u201c My dear , dear Lydia ! \u201d she cried : \u201c this is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything . How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . Stay , stay , I will go myself . Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill . I will put on my things in a moment . My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! \u201d Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner \u2019s behaviour laid them all under . \u201c For we must attribute this happy conclusion , \u201d she added , \u201c in a great measure to his kindness . We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . \u201d \u201c Well , \u201d cried her mother , \u201c it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents . Well ! I am so happy . In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . Mrs. Wickham ! How well it sounds ! And she was only sixteen last June . My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I ca n\u2019t write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me . We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . \u201d She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted . One day \u2019s delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual . Other schemes , too , came into her head . \u201c I will go to Meryton , \u201d said she , \u201c as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . Kitty , run down and order the carriage . An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ? Oh ! here comes Hill . My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . \u201d Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy . Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . Poor Lydia \u2019s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness , nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [12, 14], "text": "Mr. Bennet"}, {"position": [29, 30], "text": "him"}, {"position": [31,
