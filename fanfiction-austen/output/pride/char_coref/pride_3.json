{"document": "VI . The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . The visit was returned in due form . Miss Bennet \u2019s pleasing manners grew on the good - will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable , and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _ them _ was expressed towards the two eldest . By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value , as arising , in all probability , from the influence of their brother \u2019s admiration . It was generally evident , whenever they met , that he _ did _ admire her ; and to _ her _ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . She mentioned this to her friend , Miss Lucas . \u201c It may , perhaps , be pleasant , \u201d replied Charlotte , \u201c to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . We can all _ begin _ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better show _ more _ affection than she feels . Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . \u201d \u201c But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . If _ I _ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . \u201d \u201c Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane \u2019s disposition as you do . \u201d \u201c But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . \u201d \u201c Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . \u201d \u201c Your plan is a good one , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . But these are not Jane \u2019s feelings ; she is not acting by design . As yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . She has known him only a fortnight . She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . \u201d \u201c Not as you represent it . Had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . \u201d \u201c Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . \u201d \u201c Well , \u201d said Charlotte , \u201c I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . \u201d \u201c You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . \u201d Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley \u2019s attention to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty : he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . Of this she was perfectly unaware : to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . He began to wish to know more of her ; and , as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . His doing so drew her notice . It was at Sir William Lucas \u2019s , where a large party were assembled . \u201c What does Mr. Darcy mean , \u201d said she to Charlotte , \u201c by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? \u201d \u201c That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . \u201d \u201c But if he does it any more , I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c The entreaties of several \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said,-- \u201c Did not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? \u201d \u201c With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . \u201d \u201c You are severe on us . \u201d \u201c It will be _ her _ turn soon to be teased , \u201d said Miss Lucas . \u201c I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . \u201d \u201c You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . \u201d On Miss Lucas \u2019s persevering , however , she added , \u201c Very well ; if it must be so , it must . \u201d And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy , \u201c There is a very fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with--\u2018Keep your breath to cool your porridge,\u2019--and I shall keep mine to swell my song . \u201d Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began:-- \u201c What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing , after all . I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . \u201d \u201c Certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world : every savage can dance . \u201d Sir William only smiled . \u201c Your friend performs delightfully , \u201d he continued , after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; \u201c and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr. Darcy . \u201d \u201c You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , sir . \u201d \u201c Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . Do you often dance at St. James \u2019s ? \u201d \u201c Never , sir . \u201d \u201c Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? \u201d \u201c It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . \u201d \u201c You have a house in town , I conclude ? \u201d Mr. Darcy bowed . \u201c I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself , for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . \u201d He paused in hopes of an answer : but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her,-- \u201c My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You can not refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . \u201d And , taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr. Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William,-- \u201c Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . \u201d Mr. Darcy , with grave propriety , requested to be allowed the honour of her hand , but in vain . Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . \u201c You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . \u201d \u201c Mr. Darcy is all politeness , \u201d said Elizabeth , smiling . \u201c He is , indeed : but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? \u201d Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,-- \u201c I can guess the subject of your reverie . \u201d \u201c I should imagine not . \u201d \u201c You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner,--in such society ; and , indeed , I am quite of your opinion . I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity , and yet the noise -- the nothingness , and yet the self - importance , of all these people ! What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! \u201d \u201c Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . My mind was more agreeably engaged . I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . \u201d Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections . Mr. Darcy replied , with great intrepidity,-- \u201c Miss Elizabeth Bennet . \u201d \u201c Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! \u201d repeated Miss Bingley . \u201c I am all astonishment . How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? \u201d \u201c That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . A lady \u2019s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . I knew you would be wishing me joy . \u201d \u201c Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . \u201d He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner ; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed along . [ Illustration : \u201c A note for Miss Bennet \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] VII . Mr. Bennet \u2019s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed , in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother \u2019s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips , who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt , and to a milliner \u2019s shop just over the way . The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions : their minds were more vacant than their sisters \u2019 , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and , however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head - quarters . Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence . Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers \u2019 names and connections . Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . Mr. Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr. Bingley \u2019s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign . After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr. Bennet coolly observed,-- \u201c From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . \u201d Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . \u201c I am astonished , my dear , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , \u201c that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . If I wished to think slightingly of anybody \u2019s children , it should not be of my own , however . \u201d \u201c If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . \u201d \u201c Yes ; but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . \u201d \u201c This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . \u201d \u201c My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William \u2019s in his regimentals . \u201d \u201c Mamma , \u201d cried Lydia , \u201c my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson \u2019s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke \u2019s library . \u201d Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . Mrs. Bennet \u2019s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read,-- \u201c Well , Jane , who is it from ? What is it about ? What does he say ? Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . \u201d \u201c It is from Miss Bingley , \u201d said Jane , and then read it aloud . / * NIND \u201c My dear friend , * / \u201c If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives ; for a whole day \u2019s _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ between two women can never end without a quarrel . Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . Yours ever , \u201c CAROLINE BINGLEY . \u201d \u201c With the officers ! \u201d cried Lydia : \u201c I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . \u201d \u201c Dining out , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet ; \u201c that is very unlucky . \u201d \u201c Can I have the carriage ? \u201d said Jane . \u201c No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . \u201d \u201c That would be a good scheme , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . \u201d \u201c Oh , but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley \u2019s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . \u201d \u201c I had much rather go in the coach . \u201d \u201c But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are not they ? \u201d \u201c They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . \u201d \u201c But if you have got them to - day , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c my mother \u2019s purpose will be answered . \u201d She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged ; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day . Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard . Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . \u201c This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:-- / * NIND \u201c My dearest Lizzie , * / \u201c I find myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me . \u201c Yours , etc . \u201d \u201c Well , my dear , \u201d said Mr. Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , \u201c if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . \u201d \u201c Oh , I am not at all afraid of her dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . She will be taken good care of . As long as she stays there , it is all very well . I would go and see her if I could have the carriage . \u201d Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had : and as she was no horsewoman , walking was her only alternative . She declared her resolution . \u201c How can you be so silly , \u201d cried her mother , \u201c as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . \u201d \u201c I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want . \u201d \u201c Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , \u201d said her father , \u201c to send for the horses ? \u201d \u201c No , indeed . I do not wish to avoid the walk . The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . I shall be back by dinner . \u201d \u201c I admire the activity of your benevolence , \u201d observed Mary , \u201c but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . \u201d \u201c We will go as far as Meryton with you , \u201d said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . \u201c If we make haste , \u201d said Lydia , as they walked along , \u201c perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter , before he goes . \u201d In Meryton they parted : the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers \u2019 wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles , with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . She was shown into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother \u2019s manners there was something better than politeness -- there was good - humour and kindness . Mr. Darcy said very little , and Mr. Hurst nothing at all . The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion \u2019s justifying her coming so far alone . The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish , and not well enough to leave her room . Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . She was not equal , however , to much conversation ; and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . Elizabeth silently attended her . When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane . The apothecary came ; and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely . Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go , and very unwillingly said so . Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was despatched to Longbourn , to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .
