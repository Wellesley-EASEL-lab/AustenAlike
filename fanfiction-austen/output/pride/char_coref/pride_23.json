{"document": "XLVI . Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third her repining was over , and her sister justified , by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been mis - sent elsewhere . Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . The one mis - sent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . It was to this effect:-- \u201c Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . \u201d Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth , on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . \u201c By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I can not answer for being coherent . Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . Though Lydia \u2019s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. , intending to trace their route . He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney - coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . I know not what to think . After making every possible inquiry on that side of London , Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success,--no such people had been seen to pass through . With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. ; but no one can throw any blame on them . Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . My father and mother believe the worst , but I can not think so ill of him . Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia \u2019s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to everything ? Impossible ! I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage : he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted . My poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . Could she exert herself , it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . Adieu ! I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such , that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening . In such an exigence my uncle \u2019s advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . \u201d \u201c Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? \u201d cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr. Darcy appeared . Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia \u2019s situation , hastily exclaimed , \u201c I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . \u201d \u201c Good God ! what is the matter ? \u201d cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , \u201c I will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . You are not well enough ; you can not go yourself . \u201d Elizabeth hesitated ; but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home instantly . On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , \u201c Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . \u201d \u201c No , I thank you , \u201d she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . \u201c There is nothing the matter with me . I am quite well , I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . \u201d She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . At length she spoke again . \u201c I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . It can not be concealed from anyone . My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham . They are gone off together from Brighton . _ You _ know him too well to doubt the rest . She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . \u201d Darcy was fixed in astonishment . \u201c When I consider , \u201d she added , in a yet more agitated voice , \u201c that _ I _ might have prevented it ! _ I _ who knew what he was . Had I but explained some part of it only -- some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened . But it is all , all too late now . \u201d \u201c I am grieved , indeed , \u201d cried Darcy : \u201c grieved -- shocked . But is it certain , absolutely certain ? \u201d \u201c Oh , yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond : they are certainly not gone to Scotland . \u201d \u201c And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? \u201d \u201c My father has gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle \u2019s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . How is such a man to be worked on ? How are they even to be discovered ? I have not the smallest hope . It is every way horrible ! \u201d Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence . \u201c When _ my _ eyes were opened to his real character , oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared to do ! But I knew not -- I was afraid of doing too much . Wretched , wretched mistake ! \u201d Darcy made no answer . He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy . Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . Her power was sinking ; everything _ must _ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . She could neither wonder nor condemn ; but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress . It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . Lydia -- the humiliation , the misery she was bringing on them all -- soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said,-- \u201c I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress ! But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister \u2019s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . \u201d \u201c Oh , yes ! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy . Say that urgent business calls us home immediately . Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it can not be long . \u201d He readily assured her of his secrecy , again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and , leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious parting look , went away . As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth \u2019s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might , perhaps , authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia \u2019s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . Never since reading Jane \u2019s second letter had she entertained a hope of Wickham \u2019s meaning to marry her . No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . Surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development . While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise , all astonishment , that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible . But now it was all too natural . For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him ; but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody . Sometimes one officer , sometimes another , had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . Her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object . The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl -- oh ! how acutely did she now feel it ! She was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle \u2019s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe . Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant \u2019s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , everything relating to their journey was speedily settled . They were to be off as soon as possible . \u201c But what is to be done about Pemberley ? \u201d cried Mrs. Gardiner . \u201c John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . _ That _ is all settled . \u201d \u201c What is all settled ? \u201d repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . \u201c And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ? Oh , that I knew how it was ! \u201d But wishes were vain ; or , at best , could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr. Gardiner , meanwhile , having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . XLVII . \u201c I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , \u201d said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; \u201c and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his Colonel \u2019s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? His temptation is not adequate to the risk . \u201d \u201c Do you really think so ? \u201d cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . \u201c Upon my word , \u201d said Mrs. Gardiner , \u201c I begin to be of your uncle \u2019s opinion . It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . I can not think so very ill of Wickham . Can you , yourself , Lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? \u201d \u201c Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it . Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? \u201d \u201c In the first place , \u201d replied Mr. Gardiner , \u201c there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . \u201d \u201c Oh , but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . \u201d \u201c Well , then,--supposing them to be in London -- they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . \u201d \u201c But why all this secrecy ? Why any fear of detection ? Why must their marriage be private ? Oh , no , no -- this is not likely . His most particular friend , you see by Jane \u2019s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . He can not afford it . And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father \u2019s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . \u201d \u201c But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? \u201d \u201c It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , \u201d replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , \u201c that a sister \u2019s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . \u201d \u201c But you see that Jane , \u201d said her aunt , \u201c does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . \u201d \u201c Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . \u201d \u201c And do you really know all this ? \u201d cried Mrs. Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . \u201c I do , indeed , \u201d replied Elizabeth , colouring . \u201c I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . Yet he knew to the contrary himself . He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . \u201d \u201c But does Lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? \u201d \u201c Oh , yes!--that , that is the worst of all . Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . And when I returned home the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight \u2019s time . As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . That _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . That such a consequence as _ this _ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . \u201d \u201c When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? \u201d \u201c Not the slightest . I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . \u201d It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . From Elizabeth \u2019s thoughts it was never absent . Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self - reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness . They travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day . It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations . The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . Elizabeth jumped out ; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running downstairs from her mother \u2019s apartment , immediately met her . Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives . \u201c Not yet , \u201d replied Jane . \u201c But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . \u201d \u201c Is my father in town ? \u201d \u201c Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . \u201d \u201c And have you heard from him often ? \u201d \u201c We have heard only once . He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . \u201d \u201c And my mother -- how is she ? How are you all ? \u201d \u201c My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . She is upstairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . She does not yet leave her dressing - room . Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well . \u201d \u201c But you -- how are you ? \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c You look pale . How much you must have gone through ! \u201d Her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party . Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . When they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce the marriage . Mrs. Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes \u2019 conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill - usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill - judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . \u201c If I had been able , \u201d said she , \u201c to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . Poor , dear child ! And now here \u2019s Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . \u201d They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . \u201c Do not give way to useless alarm , \u201d added he : \u201c though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . In a few days more , we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . \u201d \u201c Oh , my dear brother , \u201d replied Mrs. Bennet , \u201c that is exactly what I could most wish for . And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry . And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . And , above all things , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting . Tell him what a dreadful state I am in -- that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . \u201d But Mr. Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters . Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it ; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _ one _ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before . One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty . As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table,-- \u201c This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . \u201d Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , \u201c Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . \u201d Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject by saying , \u201c But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard . Give me further particulars . What did Colonel Forster say ? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? They must have seen them together for ever . \u201d \u201c Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia \u2019s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . I am so grieved for him . His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . He _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . \u201d \u201c And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? Did he know of their intending to go off ? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; but when questioned by _ him _ , Denny denied knowing anything of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying , and from _ that _ I am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before . \u201d \u201c And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? \u201d \u201c How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ? I felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister \u2019s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . My father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia \u2019s last letter she had prepared her for such a step . She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other many weeks . \u201d \u201c But not before they went to Brighton ? \u201d \u201c No , I believe not . \u201d \u201c And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? Does he know his real character ? \u201d \u201c I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt : but I hope this may be false . \u201d \u201c Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! \u201d \u201c Perhaps it would have been better , \u201d replied her sister . \u201c But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . \u201d \u201c We acted with the best intentions . \u201d \u201c Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia \u2019s note to his wife ? \u201d \u201c He brought it with him for us to see . \u201d Jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to Elizabeth . These were the contents:-- / * NIND \u201c My dear Harriet , * / \u201c You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I can not help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . I am going to Gretna Green , and if you can not guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . What a good joke it will be ! I can hardly write for laughing . Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure . I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . Good - bye . Give my love to Colonel Forster . I hope you will drink to our good journey . \u201c Your affectionate friend , \u201c LYDIA BENNET . \u201d \u201c Oh , thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! \u201d cried Elizabeth when she had finished it . \u201c What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment ! But at least it shows that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy . My poor father ! how he must have felt it ! \u201d \u201c I never saw anyone so shocked . He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! \u201d \u201c Oh , Jane , \u201d cried Elizabeth , \u201c was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? \u201d \u201c I do not know : I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult . My mother was in hysterics ; and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done . But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . \u201d \u201c Your attendance upon her has been too much for you . You do not look well . Oh that I had been with you ! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . \u201d \u201c Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . She was of great use and comfort to us all , and Lady Lucas has been very kind : she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . \u201d \u201c She had better have stayed at home , \u201d cried Elizabeth : \u201c perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one \u2019s neighbours . Assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable . Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . \u201d She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . \u201c He meant , I believe , \u201d replied Jane , \u201c to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if anything could be made out from them . His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady \u2019s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked , he meant to make inquiries at Clapham . If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . I do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .
