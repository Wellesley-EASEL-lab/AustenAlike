{"document": "XXXVI . Elizabeth , when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded , that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . With a strong prejudice against everything he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension ; and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . His belief of her sister \u2019s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false ; and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . It was all pride and insolence . But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham -- when she read , with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself -- her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , \u201c This must be false ! This can not be ! This must be the grossest falsehood!\u201d--and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do : in half a minute the letter was unfolded again ; and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . So far each recital confirmed the other ; but when she came to the will , the difference was great . What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory ; and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other , and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . But when she read and re - read , with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham \u2019s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success . On both sides it was only assertion . Again she read on . But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy \u2019s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole . The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham \u2019s charge exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of inquiring . His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years \u2019 continuance . But no such recollection befriended her . She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address , but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . But , alas ! the story which followed , of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin \u2019s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question . At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin \u2019s corroboration . She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips \u2019s . Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . She was _ now _ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy -- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country , but that _ he _ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week . She remembered , also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been everywhere discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy \u2019s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son . How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned ! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at anything . His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive : he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown . Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that , proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance -- an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways -- seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible . She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . \u201c How despicably have I acted ! \u201d she cried . \u201c I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind . But vanity , not love , has been my folly . Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away where either were concerned . Till this moment , I never knew myself . \u201d From herself to Jane , from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy \u2019s explanation _ there _ had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . Widely different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister \u2019s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte \u2019s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane \u2019s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in tones of such mortifying , yet merited , reproach , her sense of shame was severe . The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial ; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt . It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane \u2019s disappointment had , in fact , been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before . After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought , reconsidering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself , as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr. Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just _ affect _ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it . Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object . She could think only of her letter . XXXVII . The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her Ladyship \u2019s indignation would have been . \u201c What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? \u201d were the questions with which she amused herself . Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings \u2019 party . \u201c I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , \u201d said Lady Catherine ; \u201c I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! But so they always are . The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely -- more , I think , than last year . His attachment to Rosings certainly increases . \u201d Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits ; and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added,-- \u201c But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . \u201d \u201c I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation , \u201d replied Elizabeth ; \u201c but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . \u201d \u201c Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . I expected you to stay two months . I told Mrs. Collins so before you came . There can be no occasion for your going so soon . Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . \u201d \u201c But my father can not . He wrote last week to hurry my return . \u201d \u201c Oh , your father , of course , may spare you , if your mother can . Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . \u201d \u201c You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . \u201d Lady Catherine seemed resigned . \u201c Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them . You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . It is highly improper . You must contrive to send somebody . I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs. Collins . I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone . \u201d \u201c My uncle is to send a servant for us . \u201d \u201c Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man - servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . Where shall you change horses ? Oh , Bromley , of course . If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . \u201d Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey ; and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary -- which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours : whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . Mr. Darcy \u2019s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . She studied every sentence ; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation : but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect : but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret : and in the unhappy defects of her family , a subject of yet heavier chagrin . They were hopeless of remedy . Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother \u2019s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? Catherine , weak - spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia \u2019s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self - willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . They were ignorant , idle , and vain . While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . Anxiety on Jane \u2019s behalf was another prevailing concern ; and Mr. Darcy \u2019s explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend . How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham \u2019s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first . The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh . When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [8, 9], "text": "her"}, {"position": [24, 25], "text": "she"},
