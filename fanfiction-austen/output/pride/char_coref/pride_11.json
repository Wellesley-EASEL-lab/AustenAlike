{"document": "XXII . The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases ; and again , during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins . Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . \u201c It keeps him in good humour , \u201d said she , \u201c and I am more obliged to you than I can express . \u201d Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . This was very amiable ; but Charlotte \u2019s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins \u2019s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . Such was Miss Lucas \u2019s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable , that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character ; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet . He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that , if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for , though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday . His reception , however , was of the most flattering kind . Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . In as short a time as Mr. Collins \u2019s long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . Mr. Collins \u2019s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . Lady Lucas began directly to calculate , with more interest than the matter had ever [ Illustration : \u201c So much love and eloquence \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] excited before , how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James \u2019s . The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion . The younger girls formed hopes of _ coming out _ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte \u2019s dying an old maid . Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . Her reflections were in general satisfactory . Mr. Collins , to be sure , was neither sensible nor agreeable : his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object : it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and , however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation . She resolved to give her the information herself ; and therefore charged Mr. Collins , when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs. Bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . \u201c My dear madam , \u201d he replied , \u201c this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . \u201d They were all astonished ; and Mr. Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said,-- \u201c But is there not danger of Lady Catherine \u2019s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . \u201d \u201c My dear sir , \u201d replied Mr. Collins , \u201c I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her Ladyship \u2019s concurrence . \u201d \u201c You can not be too much on your guard . Risk anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _ we _ shall take no offence . \u201d \u201c Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and , depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . \u201d With proper civilities , the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others : there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her ; and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that , if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion . But on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away . Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . The possibility of Mr. Collins \u2019s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two : but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself ; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out,-- \u201c Engaged to Mr. Collins ! my dear Charlotte , impossible ! \u201d The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied,-- \u201c Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman \u2019s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? \u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself ; and , making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her , with tolerable firmness , that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . \u201c I see what you are feeling , \u201d replied Charlotte ; \u201c you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . I am not romantic , you know . I never was . I ask only a comfortable home ; and , considering Mr. Collins \u2019s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . \u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201c undoubtedly ; \u201d and , after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . Charlotte did not stay much longer ; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . The strangeness of Mr. Collins \u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . She had always felt that Charlotte \u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own ; but she could not have supposed it possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage . Charlotte , the wife of Mr. Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself , and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . [ Illustration : \u201c Protested he must be entirely mistaken . \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] XXIII . Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . With many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs. Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed,-- \u201c Good Lord ! Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? \u201d Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment : but Sir William \u2019s good - breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy . Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . Mrs. Bennet was , in fact , too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and , fourthly , that the match might be broken off . Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . Nothing could console and nothing appease her . Nor did that day wear out her resentment . A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her : a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude ; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . Mr. Bennet \u2019s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match : but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs. Bennet \u2019s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again . Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve - month \u2019s abode in the family might have prompted . After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . Mr. Collins \u2019s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet . On the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley \u2019s continued absence . Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane \u2019s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters , and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . As for Jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth \u2019s : but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing ; and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill - used . It needed all Jane \u2019s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and , luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company . The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . [ Illustration : \u201c _ Whenever she spoke in a low voice _ \u201d ] Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill - humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . Whenever Charlotte came to see them , she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead . She complained bitterly of all this to her husband . \u201c Indeed , Mr. Bennet , \u201d said she , \u201c it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! \u201d \u201c My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . Let us hope for better things . Let us flatter ourselves that _ I _ may be the survivor . \u201d This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet ; and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before . \u201c I can not bear to think that they should have all this estate . If it was not for the entail , I should not mind it . \u201d \u201c What should not you mind ? \u201d \u201c I should not mind anything at all . \u201d \u201c Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . \u201d \u201c I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail . How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one \u2019s own daughters I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins , too ! Why should _ he _ have it more than anybody else ? \u201d \u201c I leave it to yourself to determine , \u201d said Mr. Bennet .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 4], "text": "The
