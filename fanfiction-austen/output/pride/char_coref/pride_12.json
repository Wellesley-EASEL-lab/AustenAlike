{"document": "XXIV . Miss Bingley \u2019s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother \u2019s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . Hope was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . Miss Darcy \u2019s praise occupied the chief of it . Her many attractions were again dwelt on ; and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother \u2019s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy \u2019s house , and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . Her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others . To Caroline \u2019s assertion of her brother \u2019s being partial to Miss Darcy , she paid no credit . That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best ; but her sister \u2019s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . She could think of nothing else ; and yet , whether Bingley \u2019s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends \u2019 interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane \u2019s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister \u2019s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last , on Mrs. Bennet \u2019s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying,-- \u201c O that my dear mother had more command over herself ! she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . But I will not repine . It can not last long . He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . \u201d Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . \u201c You doubt me , \u201d cried Jane , slightly colouring ; \u201c indeed , you have no reason . He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all . I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . Thank God I have not _ that _ pain . A little time , therefore -- I shall certainly try to get the better---- \u201d With a stronger voice she soon added , \u201c I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . \u201d \u201c My dear Jane , \u201d exclaimed Elizabeth , \u201c you are too good . Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you . I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . \u201d Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister \u2019s warm affection . \u201c Nay , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c this is not fair . _ You _ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody . _ I _ only want to think _ you _ perfect , and you set yourself against it . Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good - will . You need not . There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately : one I will not mention , the other is Charlotte \u2019s marriage . It is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! \u201d \u201c My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . They will ruin your happiness . You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . Consider Mr. Collins \u2019s respectability , and Charlotte \u2019s prudent , steady character . Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody \u2019s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . \u201d \u201c To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man : you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking . You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . \u201d \u201c I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , \u201d replied Jane ; \u201c and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . But enough of this . You alluded to something else . You mentioned _ two _ instances . I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . Women fancy admiration means more than it does . \u201d \u201c And men take care that they should . \u201d \u201c If it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . \u201d \u201c I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley \u2019s conduct to design , \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c but , without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error and there may be misery . Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people \u2019s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . \u201d \u201c And do you impute it to either of those ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; to the last . But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . Stop me , whilst you can . \u201d \u201c You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ? \u201d \u201c Yes , in conjunction with his friend . \u201d \u201c I can not believe it . Why should they try to influence him ? They can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it . \u201d \u201c Your first position is false . They may wish many things besides his happiness : they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . \u201d \u201c Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy , \u201d replied Jane ; \u201c but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother \u2019s . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . By supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . Do not distress me by the idea . I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . \u201d Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr. Bingley \u2019s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more ; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . Mrs. Bennet \u2019s best comfort was , that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer . Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently . \u201c So , Lizzy , \u201d said he , one day , \u201c your sister is crossed in love , I find . I congratulate her . Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . When is your turn to come ? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane . Now is your time . Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . Let Wickham be your man . He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . \u201d \u201c Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . We must not all expect Jane \u2019s good fortune . \u201d \u201c True , \u201d said Mr. Bennet ; \u201c but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . \u201d Mr. Wickham \u2019s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family . They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve . The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr. Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter . Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of Hertfordshire : her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes ; but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . XXV . After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . On the following Monday , Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came , as usual , to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . Mr. Gardiner was a sensible , gentlemanlike man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well - bred and agreeable . Mrs. Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces . Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . They had frequently been staying with her in town . The first part of Mrs. Gardiner \u2019s business , on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . When this was done , she had a less active part to play . It became her turn to listen . Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister . Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . \u201c I do not blame Jane , \u201d she continued , \u201c for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . But , Lizzy ! Oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins \u2019s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . The Lucases are very artful people , indeed , sister . They are all for what they can get . I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves . \u201d Mrs. Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth \u2019s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and , in compassion to her nieces , turned the conversation . When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . \u201c It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , \u201d said she . \u201c I am sorry it went off . But these things happen so often ! A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and , when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c Offended two or three young ladies \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] \u201c An excellent consolation in its way , \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c but it will not do for _ us _ . We do not suffer by accident . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . \u201d \u201c But that expression of \u2018 violently in love \u2019 is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . It is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour \u2019s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . Pray , how _ violent was _ Mr. Bingley \u2019s love ? \u201d \u201c I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance ; and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer . Could there be finer symptoms ? Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? \u201d \u201c Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . Poor Jane ! I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . \u201d Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister \u2019s ready acquiescence . \u201c I hope , \u201d added Mrs. Gardiner , \u201c that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . \u201d \u201c And _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? Mr. Darcy may , perhaps , have _ heard _ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month \u2019s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and , depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . \u201d \u201c So much the better . I hope they will not meet at all . But does not Jane correspond with his sister ? _ She _ will not be able to help calling . \u201d \u201c She will drop the acquaintance entirely . \u201d But , in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley \u2019s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane \u2019s attractions . Miss Bennet accepted her aunt \u2019s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped , by Caroline \u2019s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth \u2019s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . To Mrs. Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged . They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy \u2019s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring . Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well . Here , consequently , was an inexhaustible subject of discourse . In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself . On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy \u2019s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman \u2019s reputed disposition , when quite a lad , which might agree with it ; and was confident , at last , that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy .
