{"document": "XVI . As no objection was made to the young people \u2019s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr. Collins \u2019s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle \u2019s invitation , and was then in the house . When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine \u2019s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper \u2019s room . In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel - piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . It was over at last , however . The gentlemen did approach : and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable , gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr , Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _ they _ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle Philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room . [ Illustration : \u201c The officers of the ----shire \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her , in return , by sitting down to whist . \u201c I know little of the game at present , \u201d said he , \u201c but I shall be glad to improve myself ; for in my situation of life---- \u201d Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . Mr. Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . At first there seemed danger of Lydia \u2019s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for anyone in particular . Allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy . She dared not even mention that gentleman . Her curiosity , however , was unexpectedly relieved . Mr. Wickham began the subject himself . He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there . \u201c About a month , \u201d said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , \u201c he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d replied Wickham ; \u201c his estate there is a noble one . A clear ten thousand per annum . You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for I have been connected with his family , in a particular manner , from my infancy . \u201d Elizabeth could not but look surprised . \u201c You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy ? \u201d \u201c As much as I ever wish to be , \u201d cried Elizabeth , warmly . \u201c I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . \u201d \u201c I have no right to give _ my _ opinion , \u201d said Wickham , \u201c as to his being agreeable or otherwise . I am not qualified to form one . I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . It is impossible for _ me _ to be impartial . But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and , perhaps , you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . \u201d \u201c Upon my word I say no more _ here _ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . Everybody is disgusted with his pride . You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . \u201d \u201c I can not pretend to be sorry , \u201d said Wickham , after a short interruption , \u201c that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _ him _ I believe it does not often happen . The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . \u201d \u201c I should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . \u201d Wickham only shook his head . \u201c I wonder , \u201d said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , \u201c whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . \u201d \u201c I do not at all know ; but I _ heard _ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . \u201d \u201c Oh no -- it is not for _ me _ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy . If _ he _ wishes to avoid seeing _ me _ he must go . We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding _ him _ but what I might proclaim to all the world -- a sense of very great ill - usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . \u201d Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry . Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter , especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . \u201c It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , \u201d he added , \u201c which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire . I know it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps ; and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . Society , I own , is necessary to me . I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . I _ must _ have employment and society . A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . The church _ ought _ to have been my profession -- I was brought up for the church ; and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! \u201d \u201c Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . I can not do justice to his kindness . He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . \u201d \u201c Good heavens ! \u201d cried Elizabeth ; \u201c but how could _ that _ be ? How could his will be disregarded ? Why did not you seek legal redress ? \u201d \u201c There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing . Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it . I have a warm unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _ of _ him , and _ to _ him , too freely . I can recall nothing worse . But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . \u201d \u201c This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly disgraced . \u201d \u201c Some time or other he _ will _ be -- but it shall not be by _ me _ . Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose _ him _ . \u201d Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . \u201c But what , \u201d said she , after a pause , \u201c can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? \u201d \u201c A thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which I can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy . Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father \u2019s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life . He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me . \u201d \u201c I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him -- I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! \u201d After a few minutes \u2019 reflection , however , she continued , \u201c I _ do _ remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . His disposition must be dreadful . \u201d \u201c I will not trust myself on the subject , \u201d replied Wickham ; \u201c _ I _ can hardly be just to him . \u201d Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , \u201c To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! \u201d She could have added , \u201c A young man , too , like _ you _ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable . \u201d But she contented herself with--\u201cAnd one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner . \u201d \u201c We were born in the same parish , within the same park ; the greatest part of our youth was passed together : inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . _ My _ father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Philips , appears to do so much credit to ; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father \u2019s active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father \u2019s death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ as of affection to myself . \u201d \u201c How strange ! \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you . If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . \u201d \u201c It _ is _ wonderful , \u201d replied Wickham ; \u201c for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . \u201d \u201c Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; it has often led him to be liberal and generous ; to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . Family pride , and _ filial _ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . He has also _ brotherly _ pride , which , with _ some _ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . \u201d \u201c What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? \u201d He shook his head . \u201c I wish I could call her amiable . It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy ; but she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . But she is nothing to me now . She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . Since her father \u2019s death her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . \u201d After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying,-- \u201c I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley . How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good - humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr. Bingley ? \u201d \u201c Not at all . \u201d \u201c He is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man . He can not know what Mr. Darcy is . \u201d \u201c Probably not ; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses . He does not want abilities . He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and , perhaps , agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure . \u201d The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her , with much earnest gravity , that it was not of the least importance ; that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . \u201c I know very well , madam , \u201d said he , \u201c that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . \u201d Mr. Wickham \u2019s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . \u201c Lady Catherine de Bourgh , \u201d she replied , \u201c has very lately given him a living . I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . \u201d \u201c You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . \u201d \u201c No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine \u2019s connections . I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . \u201d \u201c Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . \u201d This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self - destined to another . \u201c Mr. Collins , \u201d said she , \u201c speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . \u201d \u201c I believe her to be both in a great degree , \u201d replied Wickham ; \u201c I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . \u201d Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham \u2019s attentions . There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips \u2019s supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody . Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully . Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent . Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and Mr. Collins , in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . [ Illustration : \u201c delighted to see their dear friend again \u201d ] XVII . Elizabeth related to Jane , the next day , what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself . Jane listened with astonishment and concern : she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley \u2019s regard ; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained . \u201c They have both , \u201d said she , \u201c been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . \u201d \u201c Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear _ them _ , too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . \u201d \u201c Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father \u2019s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? Oh no . \u201d \u201c I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley \u2019s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it . Besides , there was truth in his looks . \u201d \u201c It is difficult , indeed -- it is distressing . One does not know what to think . \u201d \u201c I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . \u201d But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley , if he _ had been _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery , where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet \u2019s civilities . The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy \u2019s look and behaviour . The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person ; for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball . And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . \u201c While I can have my mornings to myself , \u201d said she , \u201c it is enough . I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . \u201d Elizabeth \u2019s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley \u2019s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening \u2019s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke , either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance . \u201c I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , \u201d said he , \u201c that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ; a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . \u201d Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed . There was no help for it , however . Mr. Wickham \u2019s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer , and Mr. Collins \u2019s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could . She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that _ she _ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _ her _ . Elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . Mr. Collins might never make the offer , and , till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time ; for , from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe - roses for Netherfield were got by proxy . Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 11], "text": "the young people"}, {"position": [46, 49], "text": "his
