{"document": "XXVIII . Every object in the next day \u2019s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side . Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . At length the Parsonage was discernible . The garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , everything declared they were arriving . Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party . In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . She saw instantly that her cousin \u2019s manners were not altered by his marriage : his formal civility was just what it had been ; and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family . They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time , with ostentatious formality , to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife \u2019s offers of refreshment . Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect , and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . But though everything seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend , that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion . When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not seldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey , and of all that had happened in London , Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind . He could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump . But of all the views which his garden , or which the country or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . From his garden , Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows ; but the ladies , not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband \u2019s help . It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency , of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . When Mr. Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte \u2019s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr. Collins joining in , observed,-- \u201c Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her Ladyship \u2019s carriage is regularly ordered for us . I _ should _ say , one of her Ladyship \u2019s carriages , for she has several . \u201d \u201c Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , \u201d added Charlotte , \u201c and a most attentive neighbour . \u201d \u201c Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . \u201d The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth , in the solitude of her chamber , had to meditate upon Charlotte \u2019s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with , her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenour of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings . A lively imagination soon settled it all . About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and , after listening a moment , she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing - place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out,-- [ Illustration : \u201c In Conversation with the ladies \u201d [ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . ] ] \u201c Oh , my dear Eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! I will not tell you what it is . Make haste , and come down this moment . \u201d Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more ; and down they ran into the dining - room which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies , stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . \u201c And is this all ? \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! \u201d \u201c La ! my dear , \u201d said Maria , quite shocked at the mistake , \u201c it is not Lady Catherine . The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson , who lives with them . The other is Miss De Bourgh . Only look at her . She is quite a little creature . Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! \u201d \u201c She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . Why does she not come in ? \u201d \u201c Oh , Charlotte says she hardly ever does . It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . \u201d \u201c I like her appearance , \u201d said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . \u201c She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . She will make him a very proper wife . \u201d Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth \u2019s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day . [ Illustration : \u2018 Lady Catherine , said she , you have given me a treasure . \u2019 [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] XXIX . Mr. Collins \u2019s triumph , in consequence of this invitation , was complete . The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine \u2019s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . \u201c I confess , \u201d said he , \u201c that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship \u2019s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ? \u201d \u201c I am the less surprised at what has happened , \u201d replied Sir William , \u201c from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . About the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . \u201d Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings . Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner , might not wholly overpower them . When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth,-- \u201c Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . \u201d While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company ; and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James \u2019s . As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh . When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria \u2019s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth \u2019s courage did not fail her . She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation . From the entrance hall , of which Mr. Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . In spite of having been at St. James \u2019s , Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . She was not rendered formidable by silence : but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth \u2019s mind ; and , from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria \u2019s astonishment at her being so thin and so small . There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies . Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly : her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs. Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes . After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view , Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her Ladyship \u2019s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son - in - law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . The party did not supply much conversation . Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime . Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed . Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . When the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted . She inquired into Charlotte \u2019s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all ; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry . Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady \u2019s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others . In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who , she observed to Mrs. Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . She asked her at different times how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother \u2019s maiden name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed,-- \u201c Your father \u2019s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think ? For your sake , \u201d turning to Charlotte , \u201c I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh \u2019s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? \u201d \u201c A little . \u201d \u201c Oh then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? \u201d \u201c One of them does . \u201d \u201c Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours . Do you draw ? \u201d \u201c No , not at all . \u201d \u201c What , none of you ? \u201d \u201c Not one . \u201d \u201c That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . \u201d \u201c My mother would have no objection , but my father hates London . \u201d \u201c Has your governess left you ? \u201d \u201c We never had any governess . \u201d \u201c No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . \u201d Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . \u201c Then who taught you ? who attended to you ? Without a governess , you must have been neglected . \u201d \u201c Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means . We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . Those who chose to be idle certainly might . \u201d \u201c Ay , no doubt : but that is what a governess will prevent ; and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe \u2019s calling yesterday to thank me ? She finds Miss Pope a treasure . \u2018 Lady Catherine , \u2019 said she , \u2018 you have given me a treasure . \u2019 Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? \u201d \u201c Yes , ma\u2019am , all . \u201d \u201c All ! What , all five out at once ? Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? \u201d \u201c Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . Perhaps _ she _ is full young to be much in company . But really , ma\u2019am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first . And to be kept back on _ such _ a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . \u201d \u201c Upon my word , \u201d said her Ladyship , \u201c you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? \u201d \u201c With three younger sisters grown up , \u201d replied Elizabeth , smiling , \u201c your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . \u201d Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . \u201c You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . \u201d \u201c I am not one - and - twenty . \u201d When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party . Their table was superlatively stupid . Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh \u2019s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . A great deal more passed at the other table . Lady Catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologizing if he thought he won too many . Sir William did not say much . He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names . When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broken up , the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach ; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins \u2019s side , and as many bows on Sir William \u2019s , they departed . As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte \u2019s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship \u2019s praise into his own hands .", "clusters":
