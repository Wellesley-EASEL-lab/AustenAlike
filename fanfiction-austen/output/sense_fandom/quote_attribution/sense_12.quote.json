Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others .

From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident . Margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light .

But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of Colonel Brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . They contained a noble piece of water ; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning 's amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure . To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;-- and Mrs. Dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home ."}]}
