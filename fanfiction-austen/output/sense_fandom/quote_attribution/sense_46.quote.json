My illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection . Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect . I considered the past : I saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others . I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave . My illness , I well knew , had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health , as I had felt even at the time to be wrong . Had I died,--it would have been self - destruction . I did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my God , and to you all , did not kill me at once . Had I died,-- in what peculiar misery should I have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister!--You , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too ! How could you have consoled her!--I can not express my own abhorrence of myself . Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . Every body seemed injured by me . The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt . To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention.--To John , to Fanny,--yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . But you,--you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me . I , and only I , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before me ; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort ? Did I imitate your forbearance , or lessen your restraints , by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;-- not less when I knew you to be unhappy , than when I had believed you at ease , did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship ; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me , regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me , and leaving you , for or I professed an unbounded affection , to be miserable for my sake ."}, {"position": [2735, 2937], "text": "\" You are very good.--The future must be my proof . I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it -- my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself .

You , my mother , and Margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you . > From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance .
