He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two , and then left them in amazement at their indifference , to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles , as he had been already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them . When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place , they found in the appearance of the eldest , who was nearly thirty , with a very plain and not a sensible face , nothing to admire ; but in the other , who was not more than two or three and twenty , they acknowledged considerable beauty ; her features were pretty , and she had a sharp quick eye , and a smartness of air , which though it did not give actual elegance or grace , gave distinction to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil , and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense , when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton . With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight . Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles , a fond mother , though , in pursuit of praise for her children , the most rapacious of human beings , is likewise the most credulous ; her demands are exorbitant ; but she will swallow any thing ; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust . She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted . She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing . \""}, {"position": [1197, 1222], "text": "said she , on his taking Miss Steeles 's pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window--\"He is full of monkey tricks . \""}], "William": [{"position": [1246, 1252], "text": "How playful William is ! \""}], "the child": [{"position": [1253, 1262], "text": "And here is my sweet little Annamaria , \""}, {"position": [1288, 1307], "text": "And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing ! \""}], "Elinor": [{"position": [1610, 1615], "text": "Poor little creatures ! \""}, {"position": [1681, 1690], "text": "What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! \""}, {"position": [1764, 1770], "text": "And Sir John too , \""}, {"position": [1776, 1784], "text": "what a charming man he is ! \""}, {"position": [1817, 1854], "text": "And what a charming little family they have !
