They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman . Marianne looked again ; her heart sunk within her ; and abruptly turning round , she was hurrying back , when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her ; a third , almost as well known as Willoughby 's , joined them in begging her to stop , and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars . He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby ; the only one who could have gained a smile from her ; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM , and in her sister 's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment . He dismounted , and giving his horse to his servant , walked back with them to Barton , whither he was purposely coming to visit them . He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality , but especially by Marianne , who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself . To Marianne , indeed , the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour . On Edward 's side , more particularly , there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion . He was confused , seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them , looked neither rapturous nor gay , said little but what was forced from him by questions , and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection . Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise . She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward ; and it ended , as every feeling must end with her , by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby , whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect . After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting , Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London . No , he had been in Devonshire a fortnight ."}, {"position": [1733, 1773], "text": "\" she repeated , surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before .
