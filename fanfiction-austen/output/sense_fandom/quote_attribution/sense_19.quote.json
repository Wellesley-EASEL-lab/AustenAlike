It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do . But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing .

I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again\"-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John . Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton , and totally unlike her in every respect . She was short and plump , had a very pretty face , and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be . Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister 's , but they were much more prepossessing . She came in with a smile , smiled all the time of her visit , except when she laughed , and smiled when she went away . Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty , with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife , but of less willingness to please or be pleased . He entered the room with a look of self - consequence , slightly bowed to the ladies , without speaking a word , and , after briefly surveying them and their apartments , took up a newspaper from the table , and continued to read it as long as he staid .

Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park . Mrs. Dashwood , who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage , absolutely refused on her own account ; her daughters might do as they pleased . But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner , and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way .

But Sir John would not be satisfied -- the carriage should be sent for them and they must come . Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them .
