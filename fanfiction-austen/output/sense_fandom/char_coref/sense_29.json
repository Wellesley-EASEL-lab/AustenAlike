{"document": "29 Before the house - maid had lit their fire the next day , or the sun gained any power over a cold , gloomy morning in January , Marianne , only half dressed , was kneeling against one of the window - seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it , and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her . In this situation , Elinor , roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs , first perceived her ; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety , said , in a tone of the most considerate gentleness , \" Marianne , may I ask- ? \" \" No , Elinor , \" she replied , \" ask nothing ; you will soon know all . \" The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction . It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby . Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not Marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world . In such circumstances , it was better for both that they should not be long together ; and the restless state of Marianne 's mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed , but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place , made her wander about the house till breakfast time , avoiding the sight of every body . At breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and Elinor 's attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning 's notice entirely to herself . As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings , it lasted a considerable time , and they were just setting themselves , after it , round the common working table , when a letter was delivered to Marianne , which she eagerly caught from the servant , and , turning of a death - like paleness , instantly ran out of the room . Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning 's notice . That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor 's distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , \" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he wo n't keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? \" Elinor , though never less disposed to speak than at that moment , obliged herself to answer such an attack as this , and , therefore , trying to smile , replied , \" And have you really , Ma'am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister 's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ? I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . \" \" For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how can you talk so ? Do n't we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n't do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . \" \" Indeed , Ma'am , \" said Elinor , very seriously , \" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now . \" Mrs. Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her . Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne 's . The latter , though unable to speak , seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour , and after some time thus spent in joint affliction , she put all the letters into Elinor 's hands ; and then covering her face with her handkerchief , almost screamed with agony . Elinor , who knew that such grief , shocking as it was to witness it , must have its course , watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself , and then turning eagerly to Willoughby 's letter , read as follows : \" Bond Street , January . \" MY DEAR MADAM , \" I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments . I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional . I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure , and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions . My esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt , or meant to express , I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem . That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible , when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere , and it will not be many weeks , I believe , before this engagement is fulfilled . It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you , and the lock of hair , which you so obligingly bestowed on me . \" I am , dear Madam , \" Your most obedient \" humble servant , \" JOHN WILLOUGHBY . \" With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood , may be imagined . Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . Mrs. Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; for it was many days since she had any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness . A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , \" Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you ! \" \" I only wish , \" replied her sister , \" there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you . \" This , as every thing else would have been , was too much for Marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , \" Oh ! Elinor , I am miserable , indeed , \" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs . Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence . \" Exert yourself , dear Marianne , \" she cried , \" if you would not kill yourself and all who love you . Think of your mother ; think of her misery while YOU suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself . \" \" I can not , I can not , \" cried Marianne ; \" leave me , leave me , if I distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so . Oh ! how easy for those , who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion ! Happy , happy Elinor , YOU can not have an idea of what I suffer . \" \" Do you call ME happy , Marianne ? Ah ! if you knew!--And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! \" \" Forgive me , forgive me , \" throwing her arms round her sister 's neck ; \" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? \" \" Many , many circumstances , \" said Elinor , solemnly . \" No , no , no , \" cried Marianne wildly , \" he loves you , and only you . You CAN have no grief . \" \" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state . \" \" And you will never see me otherwise . Mine is a misery which nothing can do away . \" \" You must not talk so , Marianne . Have you no comforts ? no friends ? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ? Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period-- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful . \" \" Engagement ! \" cried Marianne , \" there has been no engagement . \" \" No engagement ! \" \" No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . He has broken no faith with me . \" \" But he told you that he loved you . \" \" Yes -- no -- never absolutely . It was every day implied , but never professedly declared . Sometimes I thought it had been -- but it never was . \" \" Yet you wrote to him?\" -- \" Yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I can not talk . \" Elinor said no more , and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before , directly ran over the contents of all . The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect . Berkeley Street , January . \" How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town . An opportunity of coming hither , though with Mrs. Jennings , was a temptation we could not resist . I wish you may receive this in time to come here to - night , but I will not depend on it . At any rate I shall expect you to - morrow . For the present , adieu . \" M.D. \" Her second note , which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons ' , was in these words:-- \" I can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . You had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one . We were last night at Lady Middleton 's , where there was a dance . I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ? You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise . \" M.D. \" The contents of her last note to him were these:-- \" What am I to imagine , Willoughby , by your behaviour last night ? Again I demand an explanation of it . I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced , with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify . I was repulsed indeed ! I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it . You have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion . Tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and I shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if I am to do it , if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible . My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision ; I wish to acquit you , but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer . If your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession . \" M.D. \" That such letters , so full of affection and confidence , could have been so answered , Elinor , for Willoughby 's sake , would have been unwilling to believe . But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all ; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness , not warranted by anything preceding , and most severely condemned by the event , when Marianne , perceiving that she had finished the letters , observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation . \" I felt myself , \" she added , \" to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other . \" \" I can believe it , \" said Elinor ; \" but unfortunately he did not feel the same . \" \" He DID feel the same , Elinor -- for weeks and weeks he felt it . I know he did . Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? The morning that we parted too ! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can I ever forget his distress ? \" For a moment or two she could say no more ; but when this emotion had passed away , she added , in a firmer tone , \" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . \" \" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? \" \" By all the world , rather than by his own heart . I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . This woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ? \" Elinor would not contend , and only replied , \" Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . \" \" No , no , \" cried Marianne , \" misery such as mine has no pride . I care not who knows that I am wretched . The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like -- may resist insult , or return mortification -- but I can not . I must feel -- I must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . \" \" But for my mother 's sake and mine-- \" \" I would do more than for my own . But to appear happy when I am so miserable -- Oh ! who can require it ? \" Again they were both silent . Elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window , from the window to the fire , without knowing that she received warmth from one , or discerning objects through the other ; and Marianne , seated at the foot of the bed , with her head leaning against one of its posts , again took up Willoughby 's letter , and , after shuddering over every sentence , exclaimed-- \" It is too much ! Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours ! Cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you . Elinor , nothing can . Whatever he might have heard against me-- ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? ' The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable . Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? Oh , barbarously insolent!--Elinor , can he be justified ? \" \" No , Marianne , in no possible way . \" \" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been?--how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh ! no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself . \" Another pause ensued ; Marianne was greatly agitated , and it ended thus . \" Elinor , I must go home . I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ? \" \" To - morrow , Marianne ! \" \" Yes , why should I stay here ? I came only for Willoughby 's sake -- and now who cares for me ? Who regards me ? \" \" It would be impossible to go to - morrow . We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . \" \" Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . The Middletons and Palmers -- how am I to bear their pity ? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton ! Oh , what would HE say to that ! \" Elinor advised her to lie down again , and for a moment she did so ; but no attitude could give her ease ; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another , till growing more and more hysterical , her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all , and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance . Some lavender drops , however , which she was at length persuaded to take , were of use ; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings returned , she continued on the bed quiet and motionless .", "clusters":
