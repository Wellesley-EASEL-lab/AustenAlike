{"document": "11 Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment . Yet such was the case . When Marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which Sir John had been previously forming , were put into execution . The private balls at the park then began ; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow . In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection . Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment . She only wished that it were less openly shewn ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self - command to Marianne . But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common - place and mistaken notions . Willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions . When he was present she had no eyes for any one else . Every thing he did , was right . Every thing he said , was clever . If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand . If dancing formed the amusement of the night , they were partners for half the time ; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances , were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else . Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at ; but ridicule could not shame , and seemed hardly to provoke them . Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them . To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind . This was the season of happiness to Marianne . Her heart was devoted to Willoughby , and the fond attachment to Norland , which she brought with her from Sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home . Elinor 's happiness was not so great . Her heart was not so much at ease , nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure . They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever . Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse . She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times ; and had Elinor 's memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jenning 's last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died . Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent . Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do . Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired . She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before . Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . In Colonel Brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . Willoughby was out of the question . Her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly Marianne 's , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing . Colonel Brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne , and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . Elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . His eyes were fixed on Marianne , and , after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , \" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . \" \" No , \" replied Elinor , \" her opinions are all romantic . \" \" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . \" \" I believe she does . But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not . A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . \" \" This will probably be the case , \" he replied ; \" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . \" \" I can not agree with you there , \" said Elinor . \" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne 's , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . \" After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,-- \" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? \" \" Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment 's being pardonable . \" \" This , \" said he , \" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"-- Here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered Elinor 's head . The lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips . As it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard . Elinor attempted no more . But Marianne , in her place , would not have done so little . The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position":
