{"document": "12 As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister , which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne 's imprudence and want of thought , surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both . Marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that Willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman . Without considering that it was not in her mother 's plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures . \" He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it , \" she added , \" and when it arrives we will ride every day . You shall share its use with me . Imagine to yourself , my dear Elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . \" Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them . As to an additional servant , the expense would be a trifle ; Mamma she was sure would never object to it ; and any horse would do for HIM ; he might always get one at the park ; as to a stable , the merest shed would be sufficient . Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little , or at least so lately known to her . This was too much . \" You are mistaken , Elinor , \" said she warmly , \" in supposing I know very little of Willoughby . I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;-- it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby . Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed . \" Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more . She knew her sister 's temper . Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion . But by an appeal to her affection for her mother , by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself , if ( as would probably be the case ) she consented to this increase of establishment , Marianne was shortly subdued ; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer , and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next , that it must be declined . She was faithful to her word ; and when Willoughby called at the cottage , the same day , Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice , on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present . The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related , and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible . His concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice,--\"But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . I shall keep it only till you can claim it . When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you . \" This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them . From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident . Margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and Margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves . \" Oh , Elinor ! \" she cried , \" I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon . \" \" You have said so , \" replied Elinor , \" almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . \" \" But indeed this is quite another thing . I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . \" \" Take care , Margaret . It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS . \" \" But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne 's . I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . \" For such particulars , stated on such authority , Elinor could not withhold her credit ; nor was she disposed to it , for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself . Margaret 's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister . When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was Elinor 's particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , Margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , \" I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? \" This of course made every body laugh ; and Elinor tried to laugh too . But the effort was painful . She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings . Marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret , \" Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . \" \" I never had any conjectures about it , \" replied Margaret ; \" it was you who told me of it yourself . \" This increased the mirth of the company , and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more . \" Oh ! pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it , \" said Mrs. Jennings . \" What is the gentleman 's name ? \" \" I must not tell , ma'am . But I know very well what it is ; and I know where he is too . \" \" Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure . He is the curate of the parish I dare say . \" \" No , THAT he is not . He is of no profession at all . \" \" Margaret , \" said Marianne with great warmth , \" you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . \" \" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F. \" Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing , at this moment , \" that it rained very hard , \" though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship 's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother . The idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them . Willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked Marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of Colonel Brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . They contained a noble piece of water ; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning 's amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure . To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;-- and Mrs. Dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [11, 13], "text": "the latter"}, {"position": [19, 20], "text": "her"},
