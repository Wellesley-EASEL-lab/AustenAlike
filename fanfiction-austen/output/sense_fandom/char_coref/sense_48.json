{"document": "48 Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all . But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence . That he should be married soon , before ( as she imagined ) he could be in orders , and consequently before he could be in possession of the living , surprised her a little at first . But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy , in her self - provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay . They were married , married in town , and now hastening down to her uncle 's . What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton , on seeing her mother 's servant , on hearing Lucy 's message ! They would soon , she supposed , be settled at Delaford.--Delaford,--that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest ; which she wished to be acquainted with , and yet desired to avoid . She saw them in an instant in their parsonage - house ; saw in Lucy , the active , contriving manager , uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality , and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;-- pursuing her own interest in every thought , courting the favour of Colonel Brandon , of Mrs. Jennings , and of every wealthy friend . In Edward -- she knew not what she saw , nor what she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing pleased her ; she turned away her head from every sketch of him . Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event , and give farther particulars,--but day after day passed off , and brought no letter , no tidings . Though uncertain that any one were to blame , she found fault with every absent friend . They were all thoughtless or indolent . \" When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma'am ? \" was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on . \" I wrote to him , my love , last week , and rather expect to see , than to hear from him again . I earnestly pressed his coming to us , and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow , or any day . \" This was gaining something , something to look forward to . Colonel Brandon must have some information to give . Scarcely had she so determined it , when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window . He stopt at their gate . It was a gentleman , it was Colonel Brandon himself . Now she could hear more ; and she trembled in expectation of it . But -- it was NOT Colonel Brandon -- neither his air -- nor his height . Were it possible , she must say it must be Edward . She looked again . He had just dismounted;--she could not be mistaken,--it WAS Edward . She moved away and sat down . \" He comes from Mr. Pratt 's purposely to see us . I WILL be calm ; I WILL be mistress of myself . \" In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake . She saw her mother and Marianne change colour ; saw them look at herself , and whisper a few sentences to each other . She would have given the world to be able to speak -- and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness , no slight , would appear in their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance , and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion . Not a syllable passed aloud . They all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor . His footsteps were heard along the gravel path ; in a moment he was in the passage , and in another he was before them . His countenance , as he entered the room , was not too happy , even for Elinor . His complexion was white with agitation , and he looked as if fearful of his reception , and conscious that he merited no kind one . Mrs. Dashwood , however , conforming , as she trusted , to the wishes of that daughter , by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing , met with a look of forced complacency , gave him her hand , and wished him joy . He coloured , and stammered out an unintelligible reply . Elinor 's lips had moved with her mother 's , and , when the moment of action was over , she wished that she had shaken hands with him too . But it was then too late , and with a countenance meaning to be open , she sat down again and talked of the weather . Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight , to conceal her distress ; and Margaret , understanding some part , but not the whole of the case , thought it incumbent on her to be dignified , and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could , and maintained a strict silence . When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season , a very awful pause took place . It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood , who felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well . In a hurried manner , he replied in the affirmative . Another pause . Elinor resolving to exert herself , though fearing the sound of her own voice , now said , \" Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple ? \" \" At Longstaple ! \" he replied , with an air of surprise.-- \" No , my mother is in town . \" \" I meant , \" said Elinor , taking up some work from the table , \" to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars . \" She dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him . He coloured , seemed perplexed , looked doubtingly , and , after some hesitation , said,-- \" Perhaps you mean -- my brother -- you mean Mrs.--Mrs . ROBERT Ferrars . \" \" Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\" --was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak , even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder . He rose from his seat , and walked to the window , apparently from not knowing what to do ; took up a pair of scissors that lay there , and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke , said , in a hurried voice , \" Perhaps you do not know -- you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to -- to the youngest -- to Miss Lucy Steele . \" His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor , who sat with her head leaning over her work , in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was . \" Yes , \" said he , \" they were married last week , and are now at Dawlish . \" Elinor could sit it no longer . She almost ran out of the room , and as soon as the door was closed , burst into tears of joy , which at first she thought would never cease . Edward , who had till then looked any where , rather than at her , saw her hurry away , and perhaps saw-- or even heard , her emotion ; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie , which no remarks , no inquiries , no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate , and at last , without saying a word , quitted the room , and walked out towards the village -- leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation , so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures .", "clusters":
