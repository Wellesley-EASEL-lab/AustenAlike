{"document": "5 No sooner was her answer dispatched , than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . They heard her with surprise . Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland . She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , \" Devonshire ! Are you , indeed , going there ? So far from hence ! And to what part of it ? \" She explained the situation . It was within four miles northward of Exeter . \" It is but a cottage , \" she continued , \" but I hope to see many of my friends in it . A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . \" She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton ; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection . Though her late conversation with her daughter - in - law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended . To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match . Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water . It chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne 's . Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood 's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture . Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession . No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . For the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed . HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland . The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own . Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter - in - law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure . Now was the time when her son - in - law 's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled . Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment . But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland . He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton 's first letter to Norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . \" Dear , dear Norland ! \" said Marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; \" when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you , ye well - known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!--No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you ? \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [4, 5], "text": "her"}, {"position": [9, 11], "text": "Mrs. Dashwood"}, {"position": [12, 13], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [19, 20], "text": "her"}, {"position": [29, 30], "text": "she"}, {"position": [49, 50], "text": "her"}, {"position": [55, 56], "text": "her"}, {"position": [59, 62], "text": "Mrs. John Dashwood"}, {"position": [66, 67], "text": "her"}, {"position": [71, 72], "text": "she"}, {"position": [80, 81], "text": "She"}, {"position": [87, 88], "text": "she"}, {"position": [95, 96], "text": "her"}, {"position": [116, 117], "text": "her"}, {"position": [124, 125], "text": "you"}, {"position": [144, 145], "text": "She"}, {"position": [166, 167], "text": "she"}, {"position": [171, 172], "text": "I"}, {"position": [177, 178], "text": "my"}, {"position": [193, 194], "text": "my"}, {"position": [204, 205], "text": "me"}, {"position": [206, 207], "text": "I"}, {"position": [209, 210], "text": "I"}, {"position": [218, 219], "text": "She"}, {"position": [228, 231], "text": "Mrs. John Dashwood"}, {"position": [233, 234], "text": "her"}, {"position": [240, 241], "text": "she"}, {"position": [249, 250], "text": "her"}, {"position": [253, 254], "text": "her"}, {"position": [253, 259], "text": "her daughter -
