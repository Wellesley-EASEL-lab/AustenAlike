{"document": "28 Nothing occurred during the next three or four days , to make Elinor regret what she had done , in applying to her mother ; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote . They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party , from which Mrs. Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , Marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure . She sat by the drawing - room fire after tea , till the moment of Lady Middleton 's arrival , without once stirring from her seat , or altering her attitude , lost in her own thoughts , and insensible of her sister 's presence ; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door , she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected . They arrived in due time at the place of destination , and as soon as the string of carriages before them would allow , alighted , ascended the stairs , heard their names announced from one landing - place to another in an audible voice , and entered a room splendidly lit up , quite full of company , and insufferably hot . When they had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house , they were permitted to mingle in the crowd , and take their share of the heat and inconvenience , to which their arrival must necessarily add . After some time spent in saying little or doing less , Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino , and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about , she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs , placed themselves at no great distance from the table . They had not remained in this manner long , before Elinor perceived Willoughby , standing within a few yards of them , in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman . She soon caught his eye , and he immediately bowed , but without attempting to speak to her , or to approach Marianne , though he could not but see her ; and then continued his discourse with the same lady . Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne , to see whether it could be unobserved by her . At that moment she first perceived him , and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly , had not her sister caught hold of her . \" Good heavens ! \" she exclaimed , \" he is there -- he is there -- Oh ! why does he not look at me ? why can not I speak to him ? \" \" Pray , pray be composed , \" cried Elinor , \" and do not betray what you feel to every body present . Perhaps he has not observed you yet . \" This however was more than she could believe herself ; and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne , it was beyond her wish . She sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature . At last he turned round again , and regarded them both ; she started up , and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection , held out her hand to him . He approached , and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne , as if wishing to avoid her eye , and determined not to observe her attitude , inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood , and asked how long they had been in town . Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address , and was unable to say a word . But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed . Her face was crimsoned over , and she exclaimed , in a voice of the greatest emotion , \" Good God ! Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ? Have you not received my letters ? Will you not shake hands with me ? \" He could not then avoid it , but her touch seemed painful to him , and he held her hand only for a moment . During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure . Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil . After a moment 's pause , he spoke with calmness . \" I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home . My card was not lost , I hope . \" \" But have you not received my notes ? \" cried Marianne in the wildest anxiety . \" Here is some mistake I am sure -- some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven 's sake tell me , what is the matter ? \" He made no reply ; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned ; but as if , on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking , he felt the necessity of instant exertion , he recovered himself again , and after saying , \" Yes , I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me , \" turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend . Marianne , now looking dreadfully white , and unable to stand , sunk into her chair , and Elinor , expecting every moment to see her faint , tried to screen her from the observation of others , while reviving her with lavender water . \" Go to him , Elinor , \" she cried , as soon as she could speak , \" and force him to come to me . Tell him I must see him again -- must speak to him instantly.-- I can not rest -- I shall not have a moment 's peace till this is explained -- some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him this moment . \" \" How can that be done ? No , my dearest Marianne , you must wait . This is not the place for explanations . Wait only till tomorrow . \" With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness . In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase , and telling Marianne that he was gone , urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening , as a fresh argument for her to be calm . She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home , as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer . Lady Middleton , though in the middle of a rubber , on being informed that Marianne was unwell , was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away , and making over her cards to a friend , they departed as soon the carriage could be found . Scarcely a word was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street . Marianne was in a silent agony , too much oppressed even for tears ; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home , they could go directly to their own room , where hartshorn restored her a little to herself . She was soon undressed and in bed , and as she seemed desirous of being alone , her sister then left her , and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings , had leisure enough for thinking over the past . That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt , and that Willoughby was weary of it , seemed equally clear ; for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes , SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind . Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it . Her indignation would have been still stronger than it was , had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct , and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first , without any design that would bear investigation . Absence might have weakened his regard , and convenience might have determined him to overcome it , but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt . As for Marianne , on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her , and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence , she could not reflect without the deepest concern . Her own situation gained in the comparison ; for while she could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever , however they might be divided in future , her mind might be always supported . But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby -- in an immediate and irreconcilable rupture with him
