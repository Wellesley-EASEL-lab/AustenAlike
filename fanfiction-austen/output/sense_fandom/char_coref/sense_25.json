{"document": "25 Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends , she was not without a settled habitation of her own . Since the death of her husband , who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town , she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square . Towards this home , she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts , and thither she one day abruptly , and very unexpectedly by them , asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her . Elinor , without observing the varying complexion of her sister , and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan , immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both , in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations . The reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year . Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise , and repeated her invitation immediately . \" Oh , Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it . Do n't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n't put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . \" \" I have a notion , \" said Sir John , \" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it . \" \" Nay , \" cried Mrs. Jennings , \" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . \" \" I thank you , ma'am , sincerely thank you , \" said Marianne , with warmth : \" your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,--I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . \" Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother 's decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London . That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness . On being informed of the invitation , Mrs. Dashwood , persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters , and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself , how much the heart of Marianne was in it , would not hear of their declining the offer upon HER account ; insisted on their both accepting it directly ; and then began to foresee , with her usual cheerfulness , a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all , from this separation . \" I am delighted with the plan , \" she cried , \" it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . \" \" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , \" said Elinor , \" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . \" Marianne 's countenance sunk . \" And what , \" said Mrs. Dashwood , \" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? Do let me hear a word about the expense of it . \" \" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings 's heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence . \" \" That is very true , \" replied her mother , \" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton . \" \" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , \" said Marianne , \" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . \" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . \" I will have you BOTH go , \" said Mrs. Dashwood ; \" these objections are nonsensical . You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . \" Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother 's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , \" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . \" Mrs. Dashwood smiled , and said nothing . Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue . After very little farther discourse , it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted . Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great deal of joy , and many assurances of kindness and care ; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her . Sir John was delighted ; for to a man , whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone , the acquisition of two , to the number of inhabitants in London , was something . Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted , which was putting herself rather out of her way ; and as for the Miss Steeles , especially Lucy , they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them . Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel . With regard to herself , it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not , and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence . Marianne 's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness , so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone . Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive . Her mother 's affliction was hardly less , and Elinor was the only one of the three , who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal . Their departure took place in the first week in January . The Middletons were to follow in about a week . The Miss Steeles kept their station at the park , and were to quit it only with the rest of the family .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 4], "text": "Mrs. Jennings"}, {"position": [20,
