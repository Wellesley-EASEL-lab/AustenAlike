{"document": "27 \" If this open weather holds much longer , \" said Mrs. Jennings , when they met at breakfast the following morning , \" Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ' tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day 's pleasure . Poor souls ! I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . \" \" That is true , \" cried Marianne , in a cheerful voice , and walking to the window as she spoke , to examine the day . \" I had not thought of that . This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . \" It was a lucky recollection , all her good spirits were restored by it . \" It is charming weather for THEM indeed , \" she continued , as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance . \" How much they must enjoy it ! But \" ( with a little return of anxiety ) \" it can not be expected to last long . At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer -- nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! \" \" At any rate , \" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister 's thoughts as clearly as she did , \" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . \" \" Ay , my dear , I 'll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way . \" \" And now , \" silently conjectured Elinor , \" she will write to Combe by this day 's post . \" But if she DID , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact . Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself . And Marianne was in spirits ; happy in the mildness of the weather , and still happier in her expectation of a frost . The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs. Jennings 's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town ; and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind , watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air . \" Do n't you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ? There seems to me a very decided difference . I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think . The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon . \" Elinor was alternately diverted and pained ; but Marianne persevered , and saw every night in the brightness of the fire , and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere , the certain symptoms of approaching frost . The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings 's style of living , and set of acquaintance , than with her behaviour to themselves , which was invariably kind . Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton 's regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions . Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her . Colonel Brandon , who had a general invitation to the house , was with them almost every day ; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor , who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence , but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister . She feared it was a strengthening regard . It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton . About a week after their arrival , it became certain that Willoughby was also arrived . His card was on the table when they came in from the morning 's drive . \" Good God ! \" cried Marianne , \" he has been here while we were out . \" Elinor , rejoiced to be assured of his being in London , now ventured to say , \" Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow . \" But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her , and on Mrs. Jenning 's entrance , escaped with the precious card . This event , while it raised the spirits of Elinor , restored to those of her sister all , and more than all , their former agitation . From this moment her mind was never quiet ; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day , made her unfit for any thing . She insisted on being left behind , the next morning , when the others went out . Elinor 's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence ; but a moment 's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that Willoughby had paid no second visit there . A note was just then brought in , and laid on the table , \" For me ! \" cried Marianne , stepping hastily forward . \" No , ma'am , for my mistress . \" But Marianne , not convinced , took it instantly up . \" It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! \" \" You are expecting a letter , then ? \" said Elinor , unable to be longer silent . \" Yes , a little -- not much . \" After a short pause . \" You have no confidence in me , Marianne . \" \" Nay , Elinor , this reproach from YOU -- you who have confidence in no one ! \" \" Me ! \" returned Elinor in some confusion ; \" indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell . \" \" Nor I , \" answered Marianne with energy , \" our situations then are alike . We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . \" Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne . Mrs. Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud . It was from Lady Middleton , announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before , and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening . Business on Sir John 's part , and a violent cold on her own , prevented their calling in Berkeley Street . The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence . Elinor found , when the evening was over , that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode , for although scarcely settled in town , Sir John had contrived to collect around him , nearly twenty young people , and to amuse them with a ball . This was an affair , however , of which Lady Middleton did not approve . In the country , an unpremeditated dance was very allowable ; but in London , where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained , it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls , to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple , with two violins , and a mere side - board collation . Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party ; from the former , whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town , as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother - in - law , and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance . He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room . Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure . After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come . \" I thought you were both in Devonshire , \" said he . \" Did you ? \" replied Elinor . \" When do you go back again ? \" \" I do not know . \" And thus ended their discourse . Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life , as she was that evening , and never so much fatigued by the exercise . She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street . \" Aye , aye , \" said Mrs. Jennings , \" we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . \" \" Invited ! \" cried Marianne . \" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . \" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister 's relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation . Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced . Marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it . He looked more than usually grave , and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone , as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her , sat for some time without saying a word . Elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening . It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of \" your sister looks unwell to - day , \" or \" your sister seems out of spirits , \" he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her . After a pause of several minutes , their silence was broken , by his asking her in a voice of some agitation , when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother ? Elinor was not prepared for such a question , and having no answer ready , was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient , of asking what he meant ? He tried to smile as he replied , \" your sister 's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . \" \" It can not be generally known , \" returned Elinor , \" for her own family do not know it . \" He looked surprised and said , \" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of . \" \" How can that be ? By whom can you have heard it mentioned ? \" \" By many -- by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons . But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister 's writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to- ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . \" These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much . She was not immediately able to say anything , and even when her spirits were recovered , she debated for a short time , on the answer it would be most proper to give . The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself , that in endeavouring to explain it , she might be as liable to say too much as too little . Yet as she was convinced that Marianne 's affection for Willoughby , could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon 's success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed . She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear . He listened to her with silent attention , and on her ceasing to speak , rose directly from his seat , and after saying in a voice of emotion , \" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave , and went away . Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon 's unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [12, 14], "text": "Mrs. Jennings"},
