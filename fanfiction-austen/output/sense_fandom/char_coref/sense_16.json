{"document": "16 Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby . She would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning , had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it . But the feelings which made such composure a disgrace , left her in no danger of incurring it . She was awake the whole night , and she wept the greatest part of it . She got up with a headache , was unable to talk , and unwilling to take any nourishment ; giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters , and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either . Her sensibility was potent enough ! When breakfast was over she walked out by herself , and wandered about the village of Allenham , indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning . The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling . She played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby , every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined , and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her , till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained ; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied . She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying ; her voice often totally suspended by her tears . In books too , as well as in music , she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving . She read nothing but what they had been used to read together . Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever ; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy ; but these employments , to which she daily recurred , her solitary walks and silent meditations , still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever . No letter from Willoughby came ; and none seemed expected by Marianne . Her mother was surprised , and Elinor again became uneasy . But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them , which at least satisfied herself . \" Remember , Elinor , \" said she , \" how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it . We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John 's hands . \" Elinor could not deny the truth of this , and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence . But there was one method so direct , so simple , and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair , and of instantly removing all mystery , that she could not help suggesting it to her mother . \" Why do you not ask Marianne at once , \" said she , \" whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ? From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her . She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . \" \" I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . \" Elinor thought this generosity overstrained , considering her sister 's youth , and urged the matter farther , but in vain ; common sense , common care , common prudence , were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood 's romantic delicacy . It was several days before Willoughby 's name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family ; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , indeed , were not so nice ; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;-- but one evening , Mrs. Dashwood , accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare , exclaimed , \" We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . We will put it by , that when he comes again ... But it may be months , perhaps , before THAT happens . \" \" Months ! \" cried Marianne , with strong surprise . \" No -- nor many weeks . \" Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said ; but it gave Elinor pleasure , as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions . One morning , about a week after his leaving the country , Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk , instead of wandering away by herself . Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles . If her sisters intended to walk on the downs , she directly stole away towards the lanes ; if they talked of the valley , she was as speedy in climbing the hills , and could never be found when the others set off . But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor , who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion . They walked along the road through the valley , and chiefly in silence , for Marianne 's MIND could not be controlled , and Elinor , satisfied with gaining one point , would not then attempt more . Beyond the entrance of the valley , where the country , though still rich , was less wild and more open , a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to Barton , lay before them ; and on reaching that point , they stopped to look around them , and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage , from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before . Amongst the objects in the scene , they soon discovered an animated one ; it was a man on horseback riding towards them . In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman ; and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed , \" It is he ; it is indeed;--I know it is!\" --and was hastening to meet him , when Elinor cried out , \" Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken . It is not Willoughby . The person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air . \" \" He has , he has , \" cried Marianne , \" I am sure he has . His air , his coat , his horse . I knew how soon he would come . \" She walked eagerly on as she spoke ; and Elinor , to screen Marianne from particularity , as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby , quickened her pace and kept up with her . They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman . Marianne looked again ; her heart sunk within her ; and abruptly turning round , she was hurrying back , when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her ; a third , almost as well known as Willoughby 's , joined them in begging her to stop , and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars . He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby ; the only one who could have gained a smile from her ; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM , and in her sister 's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment . He dismounted , and giving his horse to his servant , walked back with them to Barton , whither he was purposely coming to visit them . He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality , but especially by Marianne , who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself . To Marianne , indeed , the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour . On Edward 's side , more particularly , there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion . He was confused , seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them , looked neither rapturous nor gay , said little but what was forced from him by questions , and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection . Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise . She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward ; and it ended , as every feeling must end with her , by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby , whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect . After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting , Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London . No , he had been in Devonshire a fortnight . \" A fortnight ! \" she repeated , surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before . He looked rather distressed as he added , that he had been staying with some friends near Plymouth . \" Have you been lately in Sussex ? \" said Elinor . \" I was at Norland about a month ago . \" \" And how does dear , dear Norland look ? \" cried Marianne . \" Dear , dear Norland , \" said Elinor , \" probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . \" \" Oh , \" cried Marianne , \" with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall ! How have I delighted , as I walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! What feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired ! Now there is no one to regard them . They are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight . \" \" It is not every one , \" said Elinor , \" who has your passion for dead leaves . \" \" No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . But SOMETIMES they are . \"--As she said this , she sunk into a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing herself again , \" Now , Edward , \" said she , calling his attention to the prospect , \" here is Barton valley . Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . Look at those hills ! Did you ever see their equals ? To the left is Barton park , amongst those woods and plantations . You may see the end of the house . And there , beneath that farthest hill , which rises with such grandeur , is our cottage . \" \" It is a beautiful country , \" he replied ; \" but these bottoms must be dirty in winter . \" \" How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ? \" \" Because , \" replied he , smiling , \" among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane . \" \" How strange ! \" said Marianne to herself as she walked on . \" Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ? Are the Middletons pleasant people ? \" \" No , not all , \" answered Marianne ; \" we could not be more unfortunately situated . \" \" Marianne , \" cried her sister , \" how can you say so ? How can you be so unjust ? They are a very respectable family , Mr. Ferrars ; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner . Have you forgot , Marianne , how many pleasant days we have owed to them ? \" \" No , \" said Marianne , in a low voice , \" nor how many painful moments . \" Elinor took no notice of this ; and directing her attention to their visitor , endeavoured to support something like discourse with him , by talking of their present residence , its conveniences , & c. extorting from him occasional questions and remarks . His coldness and reserve mortified her severely ; she was vexed and half angry ; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present , she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure , and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Marianne"}, {"position": [5,
