{"document": "30 Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return , and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered , opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern . \" How do you do my dear?\" --said she in a voice of great compassion to Marianne , who turned away her face without attempting to answer . \" How is she , Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing ! she looks very bad.-- No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon -- a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men 's going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I wo n't disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . \" She then went away , walking on tiptoe out of the room , as if she supposed her young friend 's affliction could be increased by noise . Marianne , to the surprise of her sister , determined on dining with them . Elinor even advised her against it . But \" no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less . \" Elinor , pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive , though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner , said no more ; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could , while Marianne still remained on the bed , was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it . When there , though looking most wretchedly , she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected . Had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings 's well - meant but ill - judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her . Elinor , who did justice to Mrs. Jennings 's kindness , though its effusions were often distressing , and sometimes almost ridiculous , made her those acknowledgments , and returned her those civilities , which her sister could not make or return for herself . Their good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy , and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so . She treated her therefore , with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays . Marianne was to have the best place by the fire , was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house , and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day . Had not Elinor , in the sad countenance of her sister , seen a check to all mirth , she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings 's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love , by a variety of sweetmeats and olives , and a good fire . As soon , however , as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on Marianne , she could stay no longer . With a hasty exclamation of Misery , and a sign to her sister not to follow her , she directly got up and hurried out of the room . \" Poor soul ! \" cried Mrs. Jennings , as soon as she was gone , \" how it grieves me to see her ! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! And the dried cherries too ! Lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you ! they care no more about such things!-- \" \" The lady then -- Miss Grey I think you called her-- is very rich ? \" \" Fifty thousand pounds , my dear . Did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . But the family are all rich together . Fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it wo n't come before it 's wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . No wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! Well , it do n't signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . Why do n't he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . But that wo n't do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . \" \" Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ? Is she said to be amiable ? \" \" I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree . \"-- \" And who are the Ellisons ? \" \" Her guardians , my dear . But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now , \" after pausing a moment--\"your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself . Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . Well , by - and - by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . What shall we play at ? She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? \" \" Dear ma'am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest . \" \" Aye , I believe that will be best for her . Let her name her own supper , and go to bed . Lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . And so the letter that came today finished it ! Poor soul ! I am sure if I had had a notion of it , I would not have joked her about it for all my money . But then you know , how should I guess such a thing ? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . Lord ! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home , and told them of it . But I shall see them tomorrow . \" \" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . \" \" Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ' tis blown over and forgot . And what does talking ever do you know ? \" \" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby -- he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . \" \" Law , my dear ! Do n't pretend to defend him . No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! \" Elinor , for her sister 's sake , could not press the subject farther , and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby 's ; since , though Marianne might lose much , he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth . After a short silence on both sides , Mrs. Jennings , with all her natural hilarity , burst forth again . \" Well , my dear , ' tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon . He will have her at last ; aye , that he will . Mind me , now , if they an't married by Mid - summer . Lord ! how he 'll chuckle over this news ! I hope he will come tonight . It will be all to one a better match for your sister . Two thousand a year without debt or drawback -- except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ' prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! Lord ! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there ! Then , there is a dove - cote , some delightful stew - ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike - road , so ' tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . Oh ! ' tis a nice place ! A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone 's throw . To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can . One shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head ! \" \" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma'am , \" said Elinor , \" we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . \" And then rising , she went away to join Marianne , whom she found , as she expected , in her own room , leaning , in silent misery , over the small remains of a fire , which , till Elinor 's entrance , had been her only light . \" You had better leave me , \" was all the notice that her sister received from her . \" I will leave you , \" said Elinor , \" if you will go to bed . \" But this , from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering , she at first refused to do . Her sister 's earnest , though gentle persuasion , however , soon softened her to compliance , and Elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow , and as she hoped , in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her . In the drawing - room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings , with a wine - glass , full of something , in her hand . \" My dear , \" said she , entering , \" I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . Do take it to your sister . \" \" Dear Ma'am , \" replied Elinor , smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended , \" how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself . \" Mrs. Jennings , though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier , was satisfied with the compromise ; and Elinor , as she swallowed the chief of it , reflected , that though its effects on a colicky gout were , at present , of little importance to her , its healing powers , on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister . Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea , and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne , Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there , and , in short , that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence . Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought ; for soon after his entrance , she walked across the room to the tea - table where Elinor presided , and whispered-- \" The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see . He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . \" He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her 's , and , with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information , inquired after her sister . \" Marianne is not well , \" said she . \" She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . \" \" Perhaps , then , \" he hesitatingly replied , \" what I heard this morning may be -- there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first . \" \" What did you hear ? \" \" That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think -- in short , that a man , whom I KNEW to be engaged -- but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared . \" \" You mean , \" answered Elinor , with forced calmness , \" Mr. Willoughby 's marriage with Miss Grey . Yes , we DO know it all . This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ? \" \" In a stationer 's shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . Two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey -- it was no longer to be a secret -- it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire . My astonishment!--but it would be impossible to describe what I felt . The communicative lady I learnt , on inquiry , for I stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a Mrs. Ellison , and that , as I have been since informed , is the name of Miss Grey 's guardian . \" \" It is . But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ? In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . \" \" It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable -- at least I think\"--he stopped a moment ; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself , \" And your sister-- how did she-- \" \" Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . \" \" Ah ! \" said Colonel Brandon , \" there is , indeed ! But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ? \" \" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . \" He made no answer ; and soon afterwards , by the removal of the tea - things , and the arrangement of the card parties , the subject was necessarily dropped . Mrs. Jennings , who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking , and who expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood 's communication , in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon 's side , as might have become a man in the bloom of youth , of hope and happiness , saw him , with amazement , remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual .", "clusters":
