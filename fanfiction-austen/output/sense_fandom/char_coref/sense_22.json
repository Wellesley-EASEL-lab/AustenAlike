{"document": "22 Marianne , who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence , vulgarity , inferiority of parts , or even difference of taste from herself , was at this time particularly ill - disposed , from the state of her spirits , to be pleased with the Miss Steeles , or to encourage their advances ; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them , which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side , Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both , but especially of Lucy , who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation , or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments . Lucy was naturally clever ; her remarks were often just and amusing ; and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable ; but her powers had received no aid from education : she was ignorant and illiterate ; and her deficiency of all mental improvement , her want of information in the most common particulars , could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood , in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage . Elinor saw , and pitied her for , the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable ; but she saw , with less tenderness of feeling , the thorough want of delicacy , of rectitude , and integrity of mind , which her attentions , her assiduities , her flatteries at the Park betrayed ; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance ; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality , and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless . \" You will think my question an odd one , I dare say , \" said Lucy to her one day , as they were walking together from the park to the cottage--\"but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister - in - law 's mother , Mrs. Ferrars ? \" Elinor DID think the question a very odd one , and her countenance expressed it , as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars . \" Indeed ! \" replied Lucy ; \" I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . Then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? \" \" No , \" returned Elinor , cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward 's mother , and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity-- \" I know nothing of her . \" \" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , \" said Lucy , eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke ; \" but perhaps there may be reasons -- I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent . \" Elinor made her a civil reply , and they walked on for a few minutes in silence . It was broken by Lucy , who renewed the subject again by saying , with some hesitation , \" I can not bear to have you think me impertinently curious . I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU ; indeed , I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation as I am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble YOU . I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars . \" \" I am sorry I do NOT , \" said Elinor , in great astonishment , \" if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . \" \" I dare say you are , and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it . But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present -- but the time MAY come -- how soon it will come must depend upon herself -- when we may be very intimately connected . \" She looked down as she said this , amiably bashful , with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her . \" Good heavens ! \" cried Elinor , \" what do you mean ? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars ? Can you be ? \" And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister - in - law . \" No , \" replied Lucy , \" not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars -- I never saw him in my life ; but , \" fixing her eyes upon Elinor , \" to his eldest brother . \" What felt Elinor at that moment ? Astonishment , that would have been as painful as it was strong , had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it . She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement , unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration ; and though her complexion varied , she stood firm in incredulity , and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit , or a swoon . \" You may well be surprised , \" continued Lucy ; \" for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained . And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters . \" --She paused . Elinor for a few moments remained silent . Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words ; but at length forcing herself to speak , and to speak cautiously , she said , with calmness of manner , which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- \" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ? \" \" We have been engaged these four years . \" \" Four years ! \" \" Yes . \" Elinor , though greatly shocked , still felt unable to believe it . \" I did not know , \" said she , \" that you were even acquainted till the other day . \" \" Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . He was under my uncle 's care , you know , a considerable while . \" \" Your uncle ! \" \" Yes ; Mr. Pratt . Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt ? \" \" I think I have , \" replied Elinor , with an exertion of spirits , which increased with her increase of emotion . \" He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . \" \" Certainly , \" answered Elinor , without knowing what she said ; but after a moment 's reflection , she added , with revived security of Edward 's honour and love , and her companion 's falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really -- I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . We can not mean the same Mr. Ferrars . \" \" We can mean no other , \" cried Lucy , smiling . \" Mr. Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs. John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . \" \" It is strange , \" replied Elinor , in a most painful perplexity , \" that I should never have heard him even mention your name . \" \" No ; considering our situation , it was not strange . Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me , or my family , and , therefore , there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name to you ; and , as he was always particularly afraid of his sister 's suspecting any thing , THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it . \" She was silent.--Elinor 's security sunk ; but her self - command did not sink with it . \" Four years you have been engaged , \" said she with a firm voice . \" Yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait . Poor Edward ! It puts him quite out of heart . \" Then taking a small miniature from her pocket , she added , \" To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face . It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years . \" She put it into her hands as she spoke ; and when Elinor saw the painting , whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision , or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind , she could have none of its being Edward 's face . She returned it almost instantly , acknowledging the likeness . \" I have never been able , \" continued Lucy , \" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity . \" \" You are quite in the right , \" replied Elinor calmly . They then proceeded a few paces in silence . Lucy spoke first . \" I am sure , \" said she , \" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say . I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman . \" \" I certainly did not seek your confidence , \" said Elinor ; \" but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on . Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . \" As she said this , she looked earnestly at Lucy , hoping to discover something in her countenance ; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying ; but Lucy 's countenance suffered no change . \" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , \" said she , \" in telling you all this . I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me . She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . You ca n't think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether . I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward 's sake these last four years . Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a - year . I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . \" Here she took out her handkerchief ; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate . \" Sometimes . \" continued Lucy , after wiping her eyes , \" I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely . \" As she said this , she looked directly at her companion . \" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do . And on my own account too -- so dear as he is to me -- I do n't think I could be equal to it . What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ? What would you do yourself ? \" \" Pardon me , \" replied Elinor , startled by the question ; \" but I can give you no advice under such circumstances . Your own judgment must direct you . \" \" To be sure , \" continued Lucy , after a few minutes silence on both sides , \" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it ! Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . \" \" Did he come from your uncle 's , then , when he visited us ? \" \" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ? \" \" No , \" replied Elinor , most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy 's veracity ; \" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . \" She remembered too , her own surprise at the time , at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends , at his total silence with respect even to their names . \" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? \" repeated Lucy . \" We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived . \" \" I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits . I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; \" taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor . \" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible . \" Elinor saw that it WAS his hand , and she could doubt no longer . This picture , she had allowed herself to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been Edward 's gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for the time complete . \" Writing to each other , \" said Lucy , returning the letter into her pocket , \" is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT . If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ? \" \" I did , \" said Elinor , with a composure of voice , under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before . She was mortified , shocked , confounded . Fortunately for her , they had now reached the cottage , and the conversation could be continued no farther . After sitting with them a few minutes , the Miss Steeles returned to the Park , and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched .
