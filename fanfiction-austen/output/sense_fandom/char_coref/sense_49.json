{"document": "49 Unaccountable , however , as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family , it was certain that Edward was free ; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre - determined by all;--for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement , contracted without his mother 's consent , as he had already done for more than four years , nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of THAT , than the immediate contraction of another . His errand at Barton , in fact , was a simple one . It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question , it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did , so much in need of encouragement and fresh air . How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told . This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother 's consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men . His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful . He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits . He was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;-- and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire . He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before . His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty - four . \" It was a foolish , idle inclination on my side , \" said he , \" the consequence of ignorance of the world-- and want of employment . Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt , I think -- nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done . But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects . Considering everything , therefore , I hope , foolish as our engagement was , foolish as it has since in every way been proved , it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly . \" The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods , was such -- so great -- as promised them all , the satisfaction of a sleepless night . Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both . Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears . Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil . But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably released from his former engagement , saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity;-- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart . Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor 's company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different . Between THEM no subject is finished , no communication is even made , till it has been made at least twenty times over . Lucy 's marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor 's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard . How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out . To her own heart it was a delightful affair , to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but to her reason , her judgment , it was completely a puzzle . Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest . Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother 's affairs might have done , if applied to in time . She repeated it to Edward . \" THAT was exactly like Robert,\"--was his immediate observation.--\"And THAT , \" he presently added , \" might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began . And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour . Other designs might afterward arise . \" How long it had been carrying on between them , however , he was equally at a loss with herself to make out ; for at Oxford , where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London , he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself , and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent , nor less affectionate than usual . Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance . He put the letter into Elinor 's hands . \" DEAR SIR , \" Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another 's . Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices . Your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain , \" Your sincere well - wisher , friend , and sister , \" LUCY FERRARS . \" I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity . Please to destroy my scrawls -- but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep . \" Elinor read and returned it without any comment . \" I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition , \" said Edward.--\"For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife!--how I have blushed over the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish -- business -- this is the only letter I ever received from her , of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style . \" \" However it may have come about , \" said Elinor , after a pause,--\"they are certainly married . And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment . The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do . She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert 's marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her . \" \" She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner . \" In what state the affair stood at present between them , Edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him . He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy 's letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection . He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions-- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself . Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement , which , long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother 's anger , had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him . \" I thought it my duty , \" said he , \" independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when I was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me . In such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could I suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ? And even now , I can not comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world . She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living . \" \" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single . \" Edward was , of course , immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy 's conduct , nor more self - evident than the motive of it . Elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at Norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy . \" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong , \" said she ; \" because -- to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be . \" He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart , and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement . \" I was simple enough to think , that because my FAITH was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour . I felt that I admired you , but I told myself it was only friendship ; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy , I did not know how far I was got . After that , I suppose , I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than these:--The danger is my own ; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself . \" Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon 's being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford--\"Which , at present , \" said he , \" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering . \" NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place . But so little interest had be taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject . One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome . They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain -- and they only wanted something to live upon . Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life . Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him ; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their income . But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars 's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert 's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny . About four days after Edward 's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared , to complete Mrs. Dashwood 's satisfaction , and to give her the dignity of having , for the first time since her living at Barton , more company with her than her house would hold . Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer , and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park ; from whence he usually returned in the morning , early enough to interrupt the lovers ' first tete - a - tete before breakfast . A three weeks ' residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty - six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne 's looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother 's language , to make it cheerful . Among such friends , however , and such flattery , he did revive . No rumour of Lucy 's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew nothing of what had passed ; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering . Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor . It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other 's acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise . Their resemblance in good principles and good sense , in disposition and manner of thinking , would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship , without any other attraction ; but their being in love with two sisters , and two sisters fond of each other , made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate , which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment . The letters from town , which a few days before would have made every nerve in Elinor 's body thrill with transport , now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth . Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford.-- \" I do think , \" she continued , \" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again . And I must say that Lucy 's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all . Poor Mr. Edward ! I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him . \" Mr. Dashwood 's strains were more solemn . Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women -- poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility -- and he considered the existence of each , under such a blow , with grateful wonder . Robert 's offence was unpardonable , but Lucy 's was infinitely worse . Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence . The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy 's engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.-- He thus continued : \" Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward 's name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion . Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children . \" This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of Edward . It determined him to attempt a reconciliation , though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister . \" A letter of proper submission ! \" repeated he ; \" would they have me beg my mother 's pardon for Robert 's ingratitude to HER , and breach of honour to ME?--I can make no submission -- I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make . \" \" You may certainly ask to be forgiven , \" said Elinor , \" because you have offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother 's anger . \" He agreed that he might . \" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . \" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.-- \" And if they really DO interest themselves , \" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , \" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . \" After a visit on Colonel Brandon 's side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 10],
