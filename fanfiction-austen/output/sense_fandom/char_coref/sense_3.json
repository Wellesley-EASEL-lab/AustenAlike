{"document": "3 Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible . But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved . Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections . She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in affluence . For their brother 's sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before , in believing him incapable of generosity . His attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him , and , for a long time , she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions . The contempt which she had , very early in their acquaintance , felt for her daughter - in - law , was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character , which half a year 's residence in her family afforded ; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former , the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long , had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility , according to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood , to her daughters ' continuance at Norland . This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood , a gentleman - like and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister 's establishment at Norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there . Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest , for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich ; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence , for , except a trifling sum , the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother . But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration . It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality . It was contrary to every doctrine of her 's that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition ; and that Elinor 's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her , was to her comprehension impossible . Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address . He was not handsome , and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing . He was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart . His understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement . But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished -- as -- they hardly knew what . They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other . His mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day . Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche . But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches . All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life . Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising . Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood 's attention ; for she was , at that time , in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects . She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive , and she liked him for it . He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill - timed conversation . She was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister . It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother . \" It is enough , \" said she ; \" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough . It implies everything amiable . I love him already . \" \" I think you will like him , \" said Elinor , \" when you know more of him . \" \" Like him ! \" replied her mother with a smile . \" I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . \" \" You may esteem him . \" \" I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . \" Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him . Her manners were attaching , and soon banished his reserve . She speedily comprehended all his merits ; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration ; but she really felt assured of his worth : and even that quietness of manner , which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man 's address ought to be , was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate . No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor , than she considered their serious attachment as certain , and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching . \" In a few months , my dear Marianne . \" said she , \" Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . We shall miss her ; but SHE will be happy . \" \" Oh ! Mamma , how shall we do without her ? \" \" My love , it will be scarcely a separation . We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward 's heart . But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister 's choice ? \" \" Perhaps , \" said Marianne , \" I may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mamma , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference!\" -- \" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you WOULD give him Cowper . \" \" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper!-- but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love . I require so much ! He must have all Edward 's virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . \" \" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from her 's ! \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Mrs. Dashwood"}, {"position": [38, 39], "text":
