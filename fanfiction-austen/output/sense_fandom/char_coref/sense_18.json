{"document": "18 Elinor saw , with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend . His visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction , while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect . It was evident that he was unhappy ; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring ; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain ; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one . He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast - room the next morning before the others were down ; and Marianne , who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could , soon left them to themselves . But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open , and , turning round , was astonished to see Edward himself come out . \" I am going into the village to see my horses , \" said be , \" as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently . \" * * * Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country ; in his walk to the village , he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage ; and the village itself , in a much higher situation than the cottage , afforded a general view of the whole , which had exceedingly pleased him . This was a subject which ensured Marianne 's attention , and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes , and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him , when Edward interrupted her by saying , \" You must not enquire too far , Marianne -- remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility -- and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque . \" \" I am afraid it is but too true , \" said Marianne ; \" but why should you boast of it ? \" \" I suspect , \" said Elinor , \" that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . \" \" It is very true , \" said Marianne , \" that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning . \" \" I am convinced , \" said Edward , \" that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess . I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower -- and a troop of tidy , happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world . \" Marianne looked with amazement at Edward , with compassion at her sister . Elinor only laughed . The subject was continued no farther ; and Marianne remained thoughtfully silent , till a new object suddenly engaged her attention . She was sitting by Edward , and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood , his hand passed so directly before her , as to make a ring , with a plait of hair in the centre , very conspicuous on one of his fingers . \" I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward , \" she cried . \" Is that Fanny 's hair ? I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker . \" Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt-- but when she saw how much she had pained Edward , her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his . He coloured very deeply , and giving a momentary glance at Elinor , replied , \" Yes ; it is my sister 's hair . The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . \" Elinor had met his eye , and looked conscious likewise . That the hair was her own , she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne ; the only difference in their conclusions was , that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister , Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself . She was not in a humour , however , to regard it as an affront , and affecting to take no notice of what passed , by instantly talking of something else , she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself , beyond all doubt , that it was exactly the shade of her own . Edward 's embarrassment lasted some time , and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled . He was particularly grave the whole morning . Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said ; but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy , had she known how little offence it had given her sister . Before the middle of the day , they were visited by Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , who , having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage , came to take a survey of the guest . With the assistance of his mother - in - law , Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted Elinor , which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung . But , as it was , she only learned , from some very significant looks , how far their penetration , founded on Margaret 's instructions , extended . Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day , or to drink tea with them that evening . On the present occasion , for the better entertainment of their visitor , towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute , he wished to engage them for both . \" You MUST drink tea with us to night , \" said he , \" for we shall be quite alone -- and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . \" Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity . \" And who knows but you may raise a dance , \" said she . \" And that will tempt YOU , Miss Marianne . \" \" A dance ! \" cried Marianne . \" Impossible ! Who is to dance ? \" \" Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure.--What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! \" \" I wish with all my soul , \" cried Sir John , \" that Willoughby were among us again . \" This , and Marianne 's blushing , gave new suspicions to Edward . \" And who is Willoughby ? \" said he , in a low voice , to Miss Dashwood , by whom he was sitting . She gave him a brief reply . Marianne 's countenance was more communicative . Edward saw enough to comprehend , not only the meaning of others , but such of Marianne 's expressions as had puzzled him before ; and when their visitors left them , he went immediately round her , and said , in a whisper , \" I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ? \" \" What do you mean ? \" \" Shall I tell you . \" \" Certainly . \" \" Well then ; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts . \" Marianne was surprised and confused , yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner , and after a moment 's silence , said , \" Oh , Edward ! How can you?--But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him . \" \" I do not doubt it , \" replied he , rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth ; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general , founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby and herself , he would not have ventured to mention it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Elinor"},
