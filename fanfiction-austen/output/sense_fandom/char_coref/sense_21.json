{"document": "21 The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day , and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other . But this did not last long ; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head , had hardly done wondering at Charlotte 's being so happy without a cause , at Mr. Palmer 's acting so simply , with good abilities , and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife , before Sir John 's and Mrs. Jennings 's active zeal in the cause of society , procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe . In a morning 's excursion to Exeter , they had met with two young ladies , whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations , and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to the park , as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over . Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation , and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of Sir John , by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life , and of whose elegance,-- whose tolerable gentility even , she could have no proof ; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all . Their being her relations too made it so much the worse ; and Mrs. Jennings 's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded , when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable ; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another . As it was impossible , however , now to prevent their coming , Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it , with all the philosophy of a well - bred woman , contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day . The young ladies arrived : their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable . Their dress was very smart , their manners very civil , they were delighted with the house , and in raptures with the furniture , and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady Middleton 's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the Park . She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed , which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration . Sir John 's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles ' arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world . From such commendation as this , however , there was not much to be learned ; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England , under every possible variation of form , face , temper and understanding . Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests . Benevolent , philanthropic man ! It was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself . \" Do come now , \" said he--\"pray come -- you must come -- I declare you shall come -- You ca n't think how you will like them . Lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable ! The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance . And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more . You will be delighted with them I am sure . They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children . How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . YOU are my cousins , and they are my wife 's , so you must be related . \" But Sir John could not prevail . He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two , and then left them in amazement at their indifference , to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles , as he had been already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them . When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place , they found in the appearance of the eldest , who was nearly thirty , with a very plain and not a sensible face , nothing to admire ; but in the other , who was not more than two or three and twenty , they acknowledged considerable beauty ; her features were pretty , and she had a sharp quick eye , and a smartness of air , which though it did not give actual elegance or grace , gave distinction to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil , and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense , when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton . With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight . Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles , a fond mother , though , in pursuit of praise for her children , the most rapacious of human beings , is likewise the most credulous ; her demands are exorbitant ; but she will swallow any thing ; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust . She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted . She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing . \" John is in such spirits today ! \" said she , on his taking Miss Steeles 's pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window--\"He is full of monkey tricks . \" And soon afterwards , on the second boy 's violently pinching one of the same lady 's fingers , she fondly observed , \" How playful William is ! \" \" And here is my sweet little Annamaria , \" she added , tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old , who had not made a noise for the last two minutes ; \" And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing ! \" But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces , a pin in her ladyship 's head dress slightly scratching the child 's neck , produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams , as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy . The mother 's consternation was excessive ; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles , and every thing was done by all three , in so critical an emergency , which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer . She was seated in her mother 's lap , covered with kisses , her wound bathed with lavender - water , by one of the Miss Steeles , who was on her knees to attend her , and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other . With such a reward for her tears , the child was too wise to cease crying . She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother 's arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours . \" Poor little creatures ! \" said Miss Steele , as soon as they were gone . \" It might have been a very sad accident . \" \" Yet I hardly know how , \" cried Marianne , \" unless it had been under totally different circumstances . But this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality . \" \" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! \" said Lucy Steele . Marianne was silent ; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel , however trivial the occasion ; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it , always fell . She did her best when thus called on , by speaking of Lady Middleton with more warmth than she felt , though with far less than Miss Lucy . \" And Sir John too , \" cried the elder sister , \" what a charming man he is ! \" Here too , Miss Dashwood 's commendation , being only simple and just , came in without any eclat . She merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly . \" And what a charming little family they have ! I never saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children . \" \" I should guess so , \" said Elinor , with a smile , \" from what I have witnessed this morning . \" \" I have a notion , \" said Lucy , \" you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . \" \" I confess , \" replied Elinor , \" that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . \" A short pause succeeded this speech , which was first broken by Miss Steele , who seemed very much disposed for conversation , and who now said rather abruptly , \" And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . \" In some surprise at the familiarity of this question , or at least of the manner in which it was spoken , Elinor replied that she was . \" Norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ? \" added Miss Steele . \" We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , \" said Lucy , who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister . \" I think every one MUST admire it , \" replied Elinor , \" who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . \" \" And had you a great many smart beaux there ? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always . \" \" But why should you think , \" said Lucy , looking ashamed of her sister , \" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? \" \" Nay , my dear , I 'm sure I do n't pretend to say that there an't . I 'm sure there 's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter ; but you know , how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland ; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton , if they had not so many as they used to have . But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil . But I ca n't bear to see them dirty and nasty . Now there 's Mr. Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr. Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ? \" \" Upon my word , \" replied Elinor , \" I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . \" \" Oh ! dear ! one never thinks of married men 's being beaux -- they have something else to do . \" \" Lord ! Anne , \" cried her sister , \" you can talk of nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else . \" And then to turn the discourse , she began admiring the house and the furniture . This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough . The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation , and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty , or the shrewd look of the youngest , to her want of real elegance and artlessness , she left the house without any wish of knowing them better . Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter , well provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton , his family , and all his relations , and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins , whom they declared to be the most beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and agreeable girls they had ever beheld , and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be better acquainted therefore , Elinor soon found was their inevitable lot , for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles , their party would be too strong for opposition , and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to , which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day . Sir John could do no more ; but he did not know that any more was required : to be together was , in his opinion , to be intimate , and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual , he had not a doubt of their being established friends . To do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ' situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice , before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister 's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton . \" ' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , \" said she , \" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . \" Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward , than he had been with respect to Marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since Edward 's visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention . The letter F-- had been likewise invariably brought forward , and found productive of such countless jokes , that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor . The Miss Steeles , as she expected , had now all the benefit of these jokes , and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to , which , though often impertinently expressed , was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their family . But Sir John did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise , for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name , as Miss Steele had in hearing it . \" His name is Ferrars , \" said he , in a very audible whisper ; \" but pray do not tell it , for it 's a great secret . \" \" Ferrars ! \" repeated Miss Steele ; \" Mr. Ferrars is the happy man , is he ? What ! your sister - in - law 's brother , Miss Dashwood ? a very agreeable young man to be sure ; I know him very well . \" \" How can you say so , Anne ? \" cried Lucy , who generally made an amendment to all her sister 's assertions . \" Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle 's , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . \" Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise . \" And who was this uncle ? Where did he live ? How came they acquainted ? \" She wished very much to have the subject continued , though she did not chuse to join in it herself ; but nothing more of it was said , and for the first time in her life , she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information , or in a disposition to communicate it . The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill - natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady 's knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars 's name by Miss Steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by Sir John .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 16], "text": "the two families at Barton"}, {"position": [164, 165], "text": "Their"}, {"position": [909, 910], "text": "Their"}, {"position":
