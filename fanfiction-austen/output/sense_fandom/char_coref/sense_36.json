{"document": "36 Within a few days after this meeting , the newspapers announced to the world , that the lady of Thomas Palmer , Esq . was safely delivered of a son and heir ; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph , at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before . This event , highly important to Mrs. Jennings 's happiness , produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time , and influenced , in a like degree , the engagements of her young friends ; for as she wished to be as much as possible with Charlotte , she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed , and did not return till late in the evening ; and the Miss Dashwoods , at the particular request of the Middletons , spent the whole of every day , in every day in Conduit Street . For their own comfort they would much rather have remained , at least all the morning , in Mrs. Jennings 's house ; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody . Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles , by whom their company , in fact was as little valued , as it was professedly sought . They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former ; and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye , as intruding on THEIR ground , and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize . Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton 's behaviour to Elinor and Marianne , she did not really like them at all . Because they neither flattered herself nor her children , she could not believe them good - natured ; and because they were fond of reading , she fancied them satirical : perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical ; but THAT did not signify . It was censure in common use , and easily given . Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy . It checked the idleness of one , and the business of the other . Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them , and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times , she feared they would despise her for offering . Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three , by their presence ; and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely . Would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby , she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner , which their arrival occasioned . But this conciliation was not granted ; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor , and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne , no effect was produced , but a look of indifference from the former , or of disgust in the latter . An effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend . Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor ! But so little were they , anymore than the others , inclined to oblige her , that if Sir John dined from home , she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject , than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself . All these jealousies and discontents , however , were so totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings , that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together ; and generally congratulated her young friends every night , on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long . She joined them sometimes at Sir John 's , sometimes at her own house ; but wherever it was , she always came in excellent spirits , full of delight and importance , attributing Charlotte 's well doing to her own care , and ready to give so exact , so minute a detail of her situation , as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire . One thing DID disturb her ; and of that she made her daily complaint . Mr. Palmer maintained the common , but unfatherly opinion among his sex , of all infants being alike ; and though she could plainly perceive , at different times , the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides , there was no convincing his father of it ; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age ; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world . I come now to the relation of a misfortune , which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood . It so happened that while her two sisters with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street , another of her acquaintance had dropt in -- a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her . But while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct , and to decide on it by slight appearances , one 's happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance . In the present instance , this last - arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability , that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods , and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood 's sisters , she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street ; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards , cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister , to a small musical party at her house . The consequence of which was , that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods , but , what was still worse , must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention : and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time ? The power of disappointing them , it was true , must always be her 's . But that was not enough ; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong , they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them . Marianne had now been brought by degrees , so much into the habit of going out every day , that it was become a matter of indifference to her , whether she went or not : and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening 's engagement , though without expecting the smallest amusement from any , and very often without knowing , till the last moment , where it was to take her . To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent , as not to bestow half the consideration on it , during the whole of her toilet , which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being together , when it was finished . Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity ; she saw every thing , and asked every thing ; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne 's dress ; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself , and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted , how much her washing cost per week , and how much she had every year to spend upon herself . The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies , moreover , was generally concluded with a compliment , which though meant as its douceur , was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all ; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown , the colour of her shoes , and the arrangement of her hair , she was almost sure of being told that upon \" her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . \" With such encouragement as this , was she dismissed on the present occasion , to her brother 's carriage ; which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door , a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister - in - law , who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance , and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman . The events of this evening were not very remarkable . The party , like other musical parties , comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance , and a great many more who had none at all ; and the performers themselves were , as usual , in their own estimation , and that of their immediate friends , the first private performers in England . As Elinor was neither musical , nor affecting to be so , she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte , whenever it suited her , and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp , and violoncello , would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room . In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men , the very he , who had given them a lecture on toothpick - cases at Gray 's . She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself , and speaking familiarly to her brother ; and had just determined to find out his name from the latter , when they both came towards her , and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars . He addressed her with easy civility , and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done , that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy . Happy had it been for her , if her regard for Edward had depended less on his own merit , than on the merit of his nearest relations ! For then his brother 's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill - humour of his mother and sister would have begun . But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men , she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one , put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other . Why they WERE different , Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour 's conversation ; for , talking of his brother , and lamenting the extreme GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society , he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency , than to the misfortune of a private education ; while he himself , though probably without any particular , any material superiority by nature , merely from the advantage of a public school , was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man . \" Upon my soul , \" he added , \" I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . ' My dear Madam , ' I always say to her , ' you must make yourself easy . The evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing . Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt 's , all this would have been prevented . ' This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error . \" Elinor would not oppose his opinion , because , whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school , she could not think of Edward 's abode in Mr. Pratt 's family , with any satisfaction . \" You reside in Devonshire , I think,\"--was his next observation , \" in a cottage near Dawlish . \" Elinor set him right as to its situation ; and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire , without living near Dawlish . He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house . \" For my own part , \" said he , \" I am excessively fond of a cottage ; there is always so much comfort , so much elegance about them . And I protest , if I had any money to spare , I should buy a little land and build one myself , within a short distance of London , where I might drive myself down at any time , and collect a few friends about me , and be happy . I advise every body who is going to build , to build a cottage . My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice , and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi 's . I was to decide on the best of them . ' My dear Courtland , ' said I , immediately throwing them all into the fire , ' do not adopt either of them , but by all means build a cottage . ' And that I fancy , will be the end of it . \" Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake . I was last month at my friend Elliott 's , near Dartford . Lady Elliott wished to give a dance . ' But how can it be done ? ' said she ; ' my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed . There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ? ' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , ' My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy . The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card - tables may be placed in the drawing - room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon . ' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . We measured the dining - room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan . So that , in fact , you see , if people do but know how to set about it , every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling . \" Elinor agreed to it all , for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition . As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister , his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else ; and a thought struck him during the evening , which he communicated to his wife , for her approbation , when they got home . The consideration of Mrs. Dennison 's mistake , in supposing his sisters their guests , had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such , while Mrs. Jenning 's engagements kept her from home . The expense would be nothing , the inconvenience not more ; and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father . Fanny was startled at the proposal . \" I do not see how it can be done , \" said she , \" without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it . You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power , as my taking them out this evening shews . But they are Lady Middleton 's visitors . How can I ask them away from her ? \" Her husband , but with great humility , did not see the force of her objection . \" They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street , and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations . \" Fanny paused a moment , and then , with fresh vigor , said , \" My love I would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power . But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us . They are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and I think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by Edward . We can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more . I am sure you will like them ; indeed , you DO like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with Harry ! \" Mr. Dashwood was convinced . He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately , and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year ; at the same time , however , slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless , by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon 's wife , and Marianne as THEIR visitor . Fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it , wrote the next morning to Lucy , to request her company and her sister 's , for some days , in Harley Street , as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them . This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy . Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her , herself ; cherishing all her hopes , and promoting all her views ! Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was , above all things , the most material to her interest , and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings ! It was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged , nor too speedily made use of ; and the visit to Lady Middleton , which had not before had any precise limits , was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days ' time . When the note was shown to Elinor , as it was within ten minutes after its arrival , it gave her , for the first time , some share in the expectations of Lucy ; for such a mark of uncommon kindness , vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance , seemed to declare that the good - will towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself ; and might be brought , by time and address , to do every thing that Lucy wished . Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton , and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood ; and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater . The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street , and all that reached Elinor of their influence there , strengthened her expectation of the event . Sir John , who called on them more than once , brought home such accounts of the favour they were in , as must be universally striking . Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called Lucy by her Christian name ; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them .
