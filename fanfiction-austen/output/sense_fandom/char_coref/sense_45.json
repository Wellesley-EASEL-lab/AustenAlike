{"document": "45 Elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister . Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits . She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge . But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less . When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes . Elinor 's heart was full . The past , the present , the future , Willoughby 's visit , Marianne 's safety , and her mother 's expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby 's leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment 's horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it . Mrs. Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne 's being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but SHE , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief;-- and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears . She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . Elinor 's delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;-- but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , in compliance with her mother 's entreaty , went to bed . But the rest , which one night entirely sleepless , and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite , was kept off by irritation of spirits . Willoughby , \" poor Willoughby , \" as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful . She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby 's death . The shock of Colonel Brandon 's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection . Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood 's looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward . But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor . It was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred . \" At last we are alone . My Elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness . Colonel Brandon loves Marianne . He has told me so himself . \" Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention . \" You are never like me , dear Elinor , or I should wonder at your composure now . Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon 's marrying one of you as the object most desirable . And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . \" Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given;--but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . \" He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled . It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly . I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne . He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her . \" Here , however , Elinor perceived,--not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother 's active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose . \" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm , as more sincere or constant -- which ever we are to call it-- has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne 's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and without selfishness -- without encouraging a hope!--could he have seen her happy with another -- Such a noble mind!-- such openness , such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM . \" \" Colonel Brandon 's character , \" said Elinor , \" as an excellent man , is well established . \" \" I know it is\"--replied her mother seriously , \" or after such a warning , I should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men . \" \" His character , however , \" answered Elinor , \" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him . To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? \" \" Oh ! my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself . Marianne might at that moment be dying . But he did not ask for hope or encouragement . His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend -- not an application to a parent . Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power . Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;--Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it . \" \" To judge from the Colonel 's spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine . \" \" No.--He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed;--and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like . \" Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued , \" And his manners , the Colonel 's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby 's ever were , but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne . Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . \" She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence . \" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , \" added Mrs. Dashwood , \" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation . \" Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn . \" His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one . \" Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person , and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private , to wish success to her friend , and yet in wishing it , to feel a pang for Willoughby .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text":
