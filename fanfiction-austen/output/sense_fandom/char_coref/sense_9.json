{"document": "9 The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves . The house and the garden , with all the objects surrounding them , were now become familiar , and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford , since the loss of their father . Sir John Middleton , who called on them every day for the first fortnight , and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home , could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed . Their visitors , except those from Barton Park , were not many ; for , in spite of Sir John 's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of Mrs. Dashwood 's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk . There were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable . About a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of Allenham , which issued from that of Barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of Norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it . But they learnt , on enquiry , that its possessor , an elderly lady of very good character , was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world , and never stirred from home . The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks . The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned . The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book , in spite of Marianne 's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair , and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills ; and the two girls set off together . They gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations . \" Is there a felicity in the world , \" said Marianne , \" superior to this?--Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . \" Margaret agreed , and they pursued their way against the wind , resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer , when suddenly the clouds united over their heads , and a driving rain set full in their face.-- Chagrined and surprised , they were obliged , though unwillingly , to turn back , for no shelter was nearer than their own house . One consolation however remained for them , to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety ; it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate . They set off . Marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and Margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety . A gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne , when her accident happened . He put down his gun and ran to her assistance . She had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand . The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression . Had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance , gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings . She thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated . But this he declined , as he was dirty and wet . Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged . His name , he replied , was Willoughby , and his present home was at Allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood . The honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her . Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting . His name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting - jacket was the most becoming . Her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and Marianne 's accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham . \" Willoughby ! \" cried Sir John ; \" what , is HE in the country ? That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . \" \" You know him then , \" said Mrs. Dashwood . \" Know him ! to be sure I do . Why , he is down here every year . \" \" And what sort of a young man is he ? \" \" As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you . A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England . \" \" And is that all you can say for him ? \" cried Marianne , indignantly . \" But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? What his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? \" Sir John was rather puzzled . \" Upon my soul , \" said he , \" I do not know much about him as to all THAT . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . Was she out with him today ? \" But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr. Willoughby 's pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind . \" But who is he ? \" said Elinor . \" Where does he come from ? Has he a house at Allenham ? \" On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , \" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . \" \" I do not believe , \" said Mrs. Dashwood , with a good humoured smile , \" that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . \" \" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , \" repeated Sir John . \" I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o'clock till four , without once sitting down . \" \" Did he indeed ? \" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes , \" and with elegance , with spirit ? \" \" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . \" \" That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be . Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . \" \" Aye , aye , I see how it will be , \" said Sir John , \" I see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon . \" \" That is an expression , Sir John , \" said Marianne , warmly , \" which I particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ' setting one 's cap at a man , ' or ' making a conquest , ' are the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . \" Sir John did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then replied , \" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . \"", "clusters":
