{"document": "47 Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite . She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy . But the feelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken -- a character unblemished , to Marianne . Nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means , nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza . Nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon . Had Mrs. Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby 's story from himself -- had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater . But it was neither in Elinor 's power , nor in her wish , to rouse such feelings in another , by her retailed explanation , as had at first been called forth in herself . Reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby 's deserts;-- she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray . In the evening , when they were all three together , Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;-- but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting -- her rising colour , as she spoke,-- and her unsteady voice , plainly shewed . \" I wish to assure you both , \" said she , \" that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do . \" Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness , had not Elinor , who really wished to hear her sister 's unbiased opinion , by an eager sign , engaged her silence . Marianne slowly continued-- \" It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear . \"--For some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before--\"I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change . I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this.--I should have had no confidence , no esteem . Nothing could have done it away to my feelings . \" \" I know it -- I know it , \" cried her mother . \" Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men!--No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt . \" Marianne sighed , and repeated , \" I wish for no change . \" \" You consider the matter , \" said Elinor , \" exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain . Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self - denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that-- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? \" Marianne 's lips quivered , and she repeated the word \" Selfish ? \" in a tone that implied--\"do you really think him selfish ? \" \" The whole of his behaviour , \" replied Elinor , \" from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness . It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections ; which afterwards , when his own were engaged , made him delay the confession of it , and which finally carried him from Barton . His own enjoyment , or his own ease , was , in every particular , his ruling principle . \" \" It is very true . MY happiness never was his object . \" \" At present , \" continued Elinor , \" he regrets what he has done . And why does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards himself . It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . \" \" I have not a doubt of it , \" said Marianne ; \" and I have nothing to regret -- nothing but my own folly . \" \" Rather say your mother 's imprudence , my child , \" said Mrs. Dashwood ; \" SHE must be answerable . \" Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister 's spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , \" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams . That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . \" Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon 's injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate . Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her . Elinor , according to her expectation , saw on the two or three following days , that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done ; but while her resolution was unsubdued , and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy , her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health . Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future . Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward . She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode . Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne 's illness ; and in the first of John 's , there had been this sentence:-- \" We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ; \" which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters . She was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures . Their man - servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication-- \" I suppose you know , ma'am , that Mr. Ferrars is married . \" Marianne gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon Elinor , saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics . Mrs. Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant 's inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor 's countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne 's situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention . The servant , who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill , had sense enough to call one of the maids , who , with Mrs. Dashwood 's assistance , supported her into the other room . By that time , Marianne was rather better , and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and Elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it . \" Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married , Thomas ? \" \" I see Mr. Ferrars myself , ma'am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was . They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post - boys . I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . \" \" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ? \" \" Yes , ma'am . She smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts . She was always a very affable and free - spoken young lady , and very civil behaved . So , I made free to wish her joy . \" \" Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her ? \" \" Yes , ma'am , I just see him leaning back in it , but he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much for talking . \" Elinor 's heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward ; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation . \" Was there no one else in the carriage ? \" \" No , ma'am , only they two . \" \" Do you know where they came from ? \" \" They come straight from town , as Miss Lucy-- Mrs. Ferrars told me . \" \" And are they going farther westward ? \" \" Yes , ma'am -- but not to bide long . They will soon be back again , and then they 'd be sure and call here . \" Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter ; but Elinor knew better than to expect them . She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message , and was very confident that Edward would never come near them . She observed in a low voice , to her mother , that they were probably going down to Mr. Pratt 's , near Plymouth . Thomas 's intelligence seemed over . Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more . \" Did you see them off , before you came away ? \" \" No , ma'am -- the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late . \" \" Did Mrs. Ferrars look well ? \" \" Yes , ma'am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented . \" Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed . Marianne had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more . Mrs. Dashwood 's and Elinor 's appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before . When the dessert and the wine were arranged , and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves , they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence . Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation . She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor 's representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne . She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;-- that Marianne 's affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude
