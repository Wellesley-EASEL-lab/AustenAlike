{"document": "39 The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne 's impatience to be gone increased every day . She sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , Barton must do it . Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March , for the Easter holidays ; and Mrs. Jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them . This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure . When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious . \" Cleveland!\" --she cried , with great agitation . \" No , I can not go to Cleveland . \"-- \" You forget , \" said Elinor gently , \" that its situation is not ... that it is not in the neighbourhood of ... \" \" But it is in Somersetshire.--I can not go into Somersetshire.--There , where I looked forward to going ... No , Elinor , you can not expect me to go there . \" Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;--represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day 's journey ; and their mother 's servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ' time . As Marianne 's affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started . Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland . Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother 's concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . \" Ah ! Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods;\"--was Mrs. Jennings 's address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled--\"for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back!--Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats . \" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . This set the matter beyond a doubt . She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest . They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne 's performance brought her these words in the Colonel 's calm voice,-- \" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . \" Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , \" Lord ! what should hinder it?\" --but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . \" This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older . \" This delay on the Colonel 's side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said , \" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you . \" Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . \" I have heard , \" said he , with great compassion , \" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- \" Elinor told him that it was . \" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied , with great feeling,--\"of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to . I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more . I understand that he intends to take orders . Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day 's post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable.-- It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income . Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting him to it , will be very great . Pray assure him of it . \" Elinor 's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater , had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand . The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry;-- and SHE , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed . She thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of Edward 's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another . But at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself . It was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER , she would have been very glad to be spared herself;-- but Colonel Brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition . Edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele . She could undertake therefore to inform him of it , in the course of the day . After this had been settled , Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor , as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size . \" The smallness of the house , \" said she , \" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . \" By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr. Ferrars 's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on-- and he said so . \" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon.-- \" Such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [16, 17], "text":
