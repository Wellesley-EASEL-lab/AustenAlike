{"document": "26 Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings , and beginning a journey to London under her protection , and as her guest , without wondering at her own situation , so short had their acquaintance with that lady been , so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition , and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before ! But these objections had all , with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared , been overcome or overlooked ; and Elinor , in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby 's constancy , could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne , without feeling how blank was her own prospect , how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison , and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne 's situation to have the same animating object in view , the same possibility of hope . A short , a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby 's intentions were ; in all probability he was already in town . Marianne 's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there ; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her , but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention , as to ascertain what he was and what he meant , before many meetings had taken place . Should the result of her observations be unfavourable , she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister ; should it be otherwise , her exertions would be of a different nature -- she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison , and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne . They were three days on their journey , and Marianne 's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be . She sat in silence almost all the way , wrapt in her own meditations , and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking , except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister . To atone for this conduct therefore , Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself , behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings , talked with her , laughed with her , and listened to her whenever she could ; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness , was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment , and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn , nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod , or boiled fowls to veal cutlets . They reached town by three o'clock the third day , glad to be released , after such a journey , from the confinement of a carriage , and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire . The house was handsome , and handsomely fitted up , and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment . It had formerly been Charlotte 's , and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance , in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect . As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival , Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother , and sat down for that purpose . In a few moments Marianne did the same . \" I am writing home , Marianne , \" said Elinor ; \" had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ? \" \" I am NOT going to write to my mother , \" replied Marianne , hastily , and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry . Elinor said no more ; it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby ; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was , that , however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair , they must be engaged . This conviction , though not entirely satisfactory , gave her pleasure , and she continued her letter with greater alacrity . Marianne 's was finished in a very few minutes ; in length it could be no more than a note ; it was then folded up , sealed , and directed with eager rapidity . Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the direction ; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne , ringing the bell , requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two - penny post . This decided the matter at once . Her spirits still continued very high ; but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister , and this agitation increased as the evening drew on . She could scarcely eat any dinner , and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room , seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage . It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings , by being much engaged in her own room , could see little of what was passing . The tea things were brought in , and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door , when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house , Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby 's approach , and Marianne , starting up , moved towards the door . Every thing was silent ; this could not be borne many seconds ; she opened the door , advanced a few steps towards the stairs , and after listening half a minute , returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce ; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming , \" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! \" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms , when Colonel Brandon appeared . It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness , and she immediately left the room . Elinor was disappointed too ; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her ; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him . She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him , that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room , with such astonishment and concern , as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself . \" Is your sister ill ? \" said he . Elinor answered in some distress that she was , and then talked of head - aches , low spirits , and over fatigues ; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister 's behaviour . He heard her with the most earnest attention , but seeming to recollect himself , said no more on the subject , and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London , making the usual inquiries about their journey , and the friends they had left behind . In this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere . Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last . \" Yes , \" he replied , with some embarrassment , \" almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . \" This , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt . Mrs. Jennings soon came in . \" Oh ! Colonel , \" said she , with her usual noisy cheerfulness , \" I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with-- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ? \" \" I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer 's , where I have been dining . \" \" Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . \" \" Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . \" \" Ay , to be sure , I thought as much . Well , Colonel , I have brought two young ladies with me , you see -- that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . Your friend , Miss Marianne , too -- which you will not be sorry to hear . I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her . Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . Well ! I was young once , but I never was very handsome -- worse luck for me . However , I got a very good husband , and I do n't know what the greatest beauty can do more . Ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ? And how does your business go on ? Come , come , let 's have no secrets among friends . \" He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries , but without satisfying her in any . Elinor now began to make the tea , and Marianne was obliged to appear again . After her entrance , Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before , and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long . No other visitor appeared that evening , and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed . Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks . The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day . They had not long finished their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer 's barouche stopped at the door , and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room : so delighted to see them all , that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again . So surprised at their coming to town , though it was what she had rather expected all along ; so angry at their accepting her mother 's invitation after having declined her own , though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come ! \" Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , \" said she ; \" What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! \" After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat , or in other words , in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings 's side , and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer 's , it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning , to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented , as having likewise some purchases to make themselves ; and Marianne , though declining it at first was induced to go likewise . Wherever they went , she was evidently always on the watch . In Bond Street especially , where much of their business lay , her eyes were in constant inquiry ; and in whatever shop the party were engaged , her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them , from all that interested and occupied the others . Restless and dissatisfied every where , her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase , however it might equally concern them both : she received no pleasure from anything ; was only impatient to be at home again , and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer , whose eye was caught by every thing pretty , expensive , or new ; who was wild to buy all , could determine on none , and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision . It was late in the morning before they returned home ; and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs , and when Elinor followed , she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance , which declared that no Willoughby had been there . \" Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ? \" said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels . She was answered in the negative . \" Are you quite sure of it ? \" she replied . \" Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ? \" The man replied that none had . \" How very odd ! \" said she , in a low and disappointed voice , as she turned away to the window . \" How odd , indeed ! \" repeated Elinor within herself , regarding her sister with uneasiness . \" If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! Oh ! my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! I long to inquire ; and how will MY interference be borne . \" She determined , after some consideration , that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were , she would represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair . Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings 's intimate acquaintance , whom she had met and invited in the morning , dined with them . The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements ; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others . Marianne was of no use on these occasions , as she would never learn the game ; but though her time was therefore at her own disposal , the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor , for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment . She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read ; but the book was soon thrown aside , and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room , pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window , in hopes of distinguishing the long - expected rap .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [5, 6],
