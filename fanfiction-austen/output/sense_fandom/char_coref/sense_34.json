{"document": "34 Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband 's judgment , that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter ; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former , even the woman with whom her sisters were staying , by no means unworthy her notice ; and as for Lady Middleton , she found her one of the most charming women in the world ! Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood . There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides , which mutually attracted them ; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor , and a general want of understanding . The same manners , however , which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings , and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud - looking woman of uncordial address , who met her husband 's sisters without any affection , and almost without having anything to say to them ; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street , she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence . Elinor wanted very much to know , though she did not chuse to ask , whether Edward was then in town ; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her , till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on , or till her husband 's expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered ; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other , that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion . The intelligence however , which SHE would not give , soon flowed from another quarter . Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor 's compassion on being unable to see Edward , though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood . He dared not come to Bartlett 's Buildings for fear of detection , and though their mutual impatience to meet , was not to be told , they could do nothing at present but write . Edward assured them himself of his being in town , within a very short time , by twice calling in Berkeley Street . Twice was his card found on the table , when they returned from their morning 's engagements . Elinor was pleased that he had called ; and still more pleased that she had missed him . The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons , that , though not much in the habit of giving anything , they determined to give them-- a dinner ; and soon after their acquaintance began , invited them to dine in Harley Street , where they had taken a very good house for three months . Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise , and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon , who , always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were , received his eager civilities with some surprise , but much more pleasure . They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars ; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party . The expectation of seeing HER , however , was enough to make her interested in the engagement ; for though she could now meet Edward 's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction , though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself , her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars , her curiosity to know what she was like , was as lively as ever . The interest with which she thus anticipated the party , was soon afterwards increased , more powerfully than pleasantly , by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it . So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton , so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her , that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant , and her sister not even genteel , she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street ; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles , as soon as the Dashwoods ' invitation was known , that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place . Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood , as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother , might not have done much , however , towards procuring them seats at her table ; but as Lady Middleton 's guests they must be welcome ; and Lucy , who had long wanted to be personally known to the family , to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties , and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them , had seldom been happier in her life , than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood 's card . On Elinor its effect was very different . She began immediately to determine , that Edward who lived with his mother , must be asked as his mother was , to a party given by his sister ; and to see him for the first time , after all that passed , in the company of Lucy!--she hardly knew how she could bear it ! These apprehensions , perhaps , were not founded entirely on reason , and certainly not at all on truth . They were relieved however , not by her own recollection , but by the good will of Lucy , who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday , and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself , which he could not conceal when they were together . The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother - in - law . \" Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood ! \" said Lucy , as they walked up the stairs together -- for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings , that they all followed the servant at the same time--\"There is nobody here but you , that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand . Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on -- that is to be my mother!\" -- Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton 's mother , rather than her own , whom they were about to behold ; but instead of doing that , she assured her , and with great sincerity , that she did pity her -- to the utter amazement of Lucy , who , though really uncomfortable herself , hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor . Mrs. Ferrars was a little , thin woman , upright , even to formality , in her figure , and serious , even to sourness , in her aspect . Her complexion was sallow ; and her features small , without beauty , and naturally without expression ; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity , by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature . She was not a woman of many words ; for , unlike people in general , she proportioned them to the number of her ideas ; and of the few syllables that did escape her , not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood , whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events . Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly ; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars ' power to distress her by it now;-- and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles , a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more , only amused her . She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for Lucy was particularly distinguished -- whom of all others , had they known as much as she did , they would have been most anxious to mortify ; while she herself , who had comparatively no power to wound them , sat pointedly slighted by both . But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean - spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four . Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished ; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy . The dinner was a grand one , the servants were numerous , and every thing bespoke the Mistress 's inclination for show , and the Master 's ability to support it . In spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the Norland estate , and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss , nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;-- no poverty of any kind , except of conversation , appeared-- but there , the deficiency was considerable . John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing , and his wife had still less . But there was no peculiar disgrace in this ; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors , who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable -- Want of sense , either natural or improved -- want of elegance -- want of spirits -- or want of temper . When the ladies withdrew to the drawing - room after dinner , this poverty was particularly evident , for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety -- the variety of politics , inclosing land , and breaking horses -- but then it was all over ; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in , which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood , and Lady Middleton 's second son William , who were nearly of the same age . Had both the children been there , the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once ; but as Harry only was present , it was all conjectural assertion on both sides ; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion , and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked . The parties stood thus : The two mothers , though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest , politely decided in favour of the other . The two grandmothers , with not less partiality , but more sincerity , were equally earnest in support of their own descendant . Lucy , who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other , thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age , and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them ; and Miss Steele , with yet greater address gave it , as fast as she could , in favour of each . Elinor , having once delivered her opinion on William 's side , by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more , did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion ; and Marianne , when called on for her 's , offended them all , by declaring that she had no opinion to give , as she had never thought about it . Before her removing from Norland , Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister - in - law , which being now just mounted and brought home , ornamented her present drawing room ; and these screens , catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room , were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration . \" These are done by my eldest sister , \" said he ; \" and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well . \" The Colonel , though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship , warmly admired the screens , as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood ; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited , they were handed round for general inspection . Mrs. Ferrars , not aware of their being Elinor 's work , particularly requested to look at them ; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons 's approbation , Fanny presented them to her mother , considerately informing her , at the same time , that they were done by Miss Dashwood . \" Hum\"--said Mrs. Ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without regarding them at all , returned them to her daughter . Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough,--for , colouring a little , she immediately said , \" They are very pretty , ma'am -- an't they ? \" But then again , the dread of having been too civil , too encouraging herself , probably came over her , for she presently added , \" Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton 's style of painting , Ma'am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done ! \" \" Beautifully indeed ! But SHE does every thing well . \" Marianne could not bear this.--She was already greatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars ; and such ill - timed praise of another , at Elinor 's expense , though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it , provoked her immediately to say with warmth , \" This is admiration of a very particular kind!-- what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows , or who cares , for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak . \" And so saying , she took the screens out of her sister - in - law 's hands , to admire them herself as they ought to be admired . Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry , and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever , pronounced in retort this bitter philippic , \" Miss Morton is Lord Morton 's daughter . \" Fanny looked very angry too , and her husband was all in a fright at his sister 's audacity . Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne 's warmth than she had been by what produced it ; but Colonel Brandon 's eyes , as they were fixed on Marianne , declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it , the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point . Marianne 's feelings did not stop here . The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars 's general behaviour to her sister , seemed , to her , to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor , as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror ; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility , she moved after a moment , to her sister 's chair , and putting one arm round her neck , and one cheek close to hers , said in a low , but eager , voice , \" Dear , dear Elinor , do n't mind them . Do n't let them make YOU unhappy . \" She could say no more ; her spirits were quite overcome , and hiding her face on Elinor 's shoulder , she burst into tears . Every body 's attention was called , and almost every body was concerned.--Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs . Jennings , with a very intelligent \" Ah ! poor dear , \" immediately gave her her salts ; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress , that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele , and gave her , in a whisper , a brief account of the whole shocking affair . In a few minutes , however , Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle , and sit down among the rest ; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed , the whole evening . \" Poor Marianne ! \" said her brother to Colonel Brandon , in a low voice , as soon as he could secure his attention,-- \" She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor 's constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . You would not think it perhaps , but Marianne WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as Elinor.-- Now you see it is all gone . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1,
