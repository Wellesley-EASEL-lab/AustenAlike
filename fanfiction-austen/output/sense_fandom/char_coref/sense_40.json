{"document": "40 \" Well , Miss Dashwood , \" said Mrs. Jennings , sagaciously smiling , as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn , \" I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I TRIED to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business . And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart . \" \" Thank you , ma'am , \" said Elinor . \" It is a matter of great joy to me ; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly . There are not many men who would act as he has done . Few people who have so compassionate a heart ! I never was more astonished in my life . \" \" Lord ! my dear , you are very modest . I an't the least astonished at it in the world , for I have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen . \" \" You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel 's general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur . \" \" Opportunity ! \" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh ! as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity . Well , my dear , I wish you joy of it again and again ; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world , I think I shall soon know where to look for them . \" \" You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose , \" said Elinor , with a faint smile . \" Aye , my dear , that I do , indeed . And as to the house being a bad one , I do not know what the Colonel would be at , for it is as good a one as ever I saw . \" \" He spoke of its being out of repair . \" \" Well , and whose fault is that ? why do n't he repair it?-- who should do it but himself ? \" They were interrupted by the servant 's coming in to announce the carriage being at the door ; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to go , said,-- \" Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out . But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it . \" Marianne had left the room before the conversation began . \" Certainly , ma'am , I shall tell Marianne of it ; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else . \" \" Oh ! very well , \" said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed . \" Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy , for I think of going as far as Holborn to - day . \" \" No , ma'am , not even Lucy if you please . One day 's delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . I shall do THAT directly . It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . \" This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly . Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry , she could not immediately comprehend . A few moments ' reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed;-- \" Oh , ho!--I understand you . Mr. Ferrars is to be the man . Well , so much the better for him . Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? Should not the Colonel write himself?--sure , he is the proper person . \" Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings 's speech , neither did she think it worth inquiring into ; and therefore only replied to its conclusion . \" Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man , that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself . \" \" And so YOU are forced to do it . Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy ! However , I will not disturb you ( seeing her preparing to write . ) You know your own concerns best . So goodby , my dear . I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed . \" And away she went ; but returning again in a moment , \" I have just been thinking of Betty 's sister , my dear . I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . But whether she would do for a lady 's maid , I am sure I ca n't tell . She is an excellent housemaid , and works very well at her needle . However , you will think of all that at your leisure . \" \" Certainly , ma'am , \" replied Elinor , not hearing much of what she said , and more anxious to be alone , than to be mistress of the subject . How she should begin -- how she should express herself in her note to Edward , was now all her concern . The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world ; but she equally feared to say too much or too little , and sat deliberating over her paper , with the pen in her band , till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself . He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage , as he came to leave his farewell card ; and she , after apologising for not returning herself , had obliged him to enter , by saying that Miss Dashwood was above , and wanted to speak with him on very particular business . Elinor had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity , that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter , it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth , when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all . Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance . She had not seen him before since his engagement became public , and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it ; which , with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of , and what she had to tell him , made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes . He too was much distressed ; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room , he could not recollect ; but determining to be on the safe side , he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing , after taking a chair . \" Mrs. Jennings told me , \" said he , \" that you wished to speak with me , at least I understood her so -- or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner ; though at the same time , I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister ; especially as it will most likely be some time -- it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again . I go to Oxford tomorrow . \" \" You would not have gone , however , \" said Elinor , recovering herself , and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible , \" without receiving our good wishes , even if we had not been able to give them in person . Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said . I have something of consequence to inform you of , which I was on the point of communicating by paper . I am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke . ) Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living -- it is about two hundred a - year -- were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to -- as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself -- such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness . \" What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it can not be expected that any one else should say for him . He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected , such unthought - of information could not fail of exciting ; but he said only these two words , \" Colonel Brandon ! \" \" Yes , \" continued Elinor , gathering more resolution , as some of the worst was over , \" Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed -- for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you -- a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion . \" \" Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible ? \" \" The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where . \" \" No , \" replied be , with sudden consciousness , \" not to find it in YOU ; for I can not be ignorant that to you , to your goodness , I owe it all.--I feel it -- I would express it if I could -- but , as you well know , I am no orator . \" \" You are very much mistaken . I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon 's discernment of it . I have had no hand in it . I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift . As a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps -- indeed I know he HAS , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation . \" Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it . For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak;--at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said , \" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability . I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly . He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . \" \" Indeed , \" replied Elinor , \" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this . \" Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater . \" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St. James Street , \" said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair . Elinor told him the number of the house . \" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man . \" Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on HIS , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it . \" When I see him again , \" said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , \" I shall see him the husband of Lucy . \" And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent . When Mrs. Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared . \" Well , my dear , \" she cried , \" I sent you up to the young man . Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? \" \" No , ma'am ; THAT was not very likely . \" \" Well , and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon that . \" \" Really , \" said Elinor , \" I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination . \" \" Two or three months ! \" cried Mrs. Jennings ; \" Lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months ! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . \" \" My dear ma'am , \" said Elinor , \" what can you be thinking of?-- Why , Colonel Brandon 's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . \" \" Lord bless you , my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! \" The deception could not continue after this ; and an explanation immediately took place , by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment , without any material loss of happiness to either , for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another , and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first . \" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , \" said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , \" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!-- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it . \" \" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry . \" \" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas ; and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . \" Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 11], "text": "Mrs. Jennings"}, {"position": [18, 20], "text": "the gentleman"}, {"position":
