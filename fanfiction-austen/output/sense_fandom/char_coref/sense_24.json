{"document": "24 In a firm , though cautious tone , Elinor thus began . \" I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . \" \" Thank you , \" cried Lucy warmly , \" for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday . \" \" Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me , \" and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity , \" nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ? \" \" And yet I do assure you , \" replied Lucy , her little sharp eyes full of meaning , \" there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . \" \" Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr. Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . \" \" He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward 's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . \" \" That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your 's . If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ' engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . \" Lucy here looked up ; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency . \" Edward 's love for me , \" said Lucy , \" has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment 's alarm on that account from the first . \" Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion . Lucy went on . \" I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . \" \" All this , \" thought Elinor , \" is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . \" \" But what , \" said she after a short silence , \" are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars 's death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? \" \" If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward 's sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . \" \" And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason . \" Lucy looked at Elinor again , and was silent . \" Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? \" asked Elinor . \" Not at all -- I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother -- silly and a great coxcomb . \" \" A great coxcomb ! \" repeated Miss Steele , whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne 's music.-- \" Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say . \" \" No sister , \" cried Lucy , \" you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs . \" \" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood 's is not , \" said Mrs. Jennings , laughing heartily ; \" for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes . \" \" Oh , \" cried Miss Steele , looking significantly round at them , \" I dare say Lucy 's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood 's . \" Elinor blushed in spite of herself . Lucy bit her lip , and looked angrily at her sister . A mutual silence took place for some time . Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone , though Marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto-- \" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . \" \" I should always be happy , \" replied Elinor , \" to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood -- THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband . \" \" But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward 's going into orders . \" \" Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . \" They were again silent for many minutes . At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh , \" I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ? \" \" No , \" answered Elinor , with a smile , which concealed very agitated feelings , \" on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . \" \" Indeed you wrong me , \" replied Lucy , with great solemnity ; \" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately . \" Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward 's future wife , and replied , \" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . \" \" ' Tis because you are an indifferent person , \" said Lucy , with some pique , and laying a particular stress on those words , \" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . \" Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this , lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve ; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again . Another pause therefore of many minutes ' duration , succeeded this speech , and Lucy was still the first to end it . \" Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? \" said she with all her accustomary complacency . \" Certainly not . \" \" I am sorry for that , \" returned the other , while her eyes brightened at the information , \" it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! But I dare say you will go for all that . To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them . \" \" It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . \" \" How unlucky that is ! I had quite depended upon meeting you there . Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . \" Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary . From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself . The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied . Their favour increased ; they could not be spared ; Sir John would not hear of their going ; and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter , in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately , which was in full force at the end of every week , they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park , and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 10], "text": "Elinor"},
