{"document": "20 As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing - room of the park the next day , at one door , Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other , looking as good humoured and merry as before . She took them all most affectionately by the hand , and expressed great delight in seeing them again . \" I am so glad to see you ! \" said she , seating herself between Elinor and Marianne , \" for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow . We must go , for the Westons come to us next week you know . It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all , and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door , and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton . He is so droll ! He never tells me any thing ! I am so sorry we can not stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , I hope . \" They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation . \" Not go to town ! \" cried Mrs. Palmer , with a laugh , \" I shall be quite disappointed if you do not . I could get the nicest house in world for you , next door to ours , in Hanover - square . You must come , indeed . I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined , if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public . \" They thanked her ; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties . \" Oh , my love , \" cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband , who just then entered the room--\"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter . \" Her love made no answer ; and after slightly bowing to the ladies , began complaining of the weather . \" How horrid all this is ! \" said he . \" Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting . Dullness is as much produced within doors as without , by rain . It makes one detest all one 's acquaintance . What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house ? How few people know what comfort is ! Sir John is as stupid as the weather . \" The rest of the company soon dropt in . \" I am afraid , Miss Marianne , \" said Sir John , \" you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today . \" Marianne looked very grave and said nothing . \" Oh , do n't be so sly before us , \" said Mrs. Palmer ; \" for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome . We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . Not above ten miles , I dare say . \" \" Much nearer thirty , \" said her husband . \" Ah , well ! there is not much difference . I never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place . \" \" As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life , \" said Mr. Palmer . Marianne remained perfectly silent , though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said . \" Is it very ugly ? \" continued Mrs. Palmer--\"then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose . \" When they were seated in the dining room , Sir John observed with regret that they were only eight all together . \" My dear , \" said he to his lady , \" it is very provoking that we should be so few . Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today ? \" \" Did not I tell you , Sir John , when you spoke to me about it before , that it could not be done ? They dined with us last . \" \" You and I , Sir John , \" said Mrs. Jennings , \" should not stand upon such ceremony . \" \" Then you would be very ill - bred , \" cried Mr. Palmer . \" My love you contradict every body , \" said his wife with her usual laugh . \" Do you know that you are quite rude ? \" \" I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred . \" \" Ay , you may abuse me as you please , \" said the good - natured old lady , \" you have taken Charlotte off my hands , and can not give her back again . So there I have the whip hand of you . \" Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her ; and exultingly said , she did not care how cross he was to her , as they must live together . It was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good - natured , or more determined to be happy than Mrs. Palmer . The studied indifference , insolence , and discontent of her husband gave her no pain ; and when he scolded or abused her , she was highly diverted . \" Mr. Palmer is so droll ! \" said she , in a whisper , to Elinor . \" He is always out of humour . \" Elinor was not inclined , after a little observation , to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill - natured or ill - bred as he wished to appear . His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding , like many others of his sex , that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty , he was the husband of a very silly woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish of distinction , she believed , which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body , and his general abuse of every thing before him . It was the desire of appearing superior to other people . The motive was too common to be wondered at ; but the means , however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill - breeding , were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife . \" Oh , my dear Miss Dashwood , \" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards , \" I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister . Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas ? Now , pray do,--and come while the Westons are with us . You can not think how happy I shall be ! It will be quite delightful!--My love , \" applying to her husband , \" do n't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland ? \" \" Certainly , \" he replied , with a sneer--\"I came into Devonshire with no other view . \" \" There now,\"--said his lady , \" you see Mr. Palmer expects you ; so you can not refuse to come . \" They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation . \" But indeed you must and shall come . I am sure you will like it of all things . The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful . You can not think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming ! But , poor fellow ! it is very fatiguing to him ! for he is forced to make every body like him . \" Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation . \" How charming it will be , \" said Charlotte , \" when he is in Parliament!--won't it ? How I shall laugh ! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.--But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ? He declares he wo n't . Do n't you , Mr. Palmer ? \" Mr. Palmer took no notice of her . \" He can not bear writing , you know , \" she continued-- \" he says it is quite shocking . \" \" No , \" said he , \" I never said any thing so irrational . Do n't palm all your abuses of languages upon me . \" \" There now ; you see how droll he is . This is always the way with him ! Sometimes he wo n't speak to me for half a day together , and then he comes out with something so droll -- all about any thing in the world . \" She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing - room , by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively . \" Certainly , \" said Elinor ; \" he seems very agreeable . \" \" Well -- I am so glad you do . I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you ca n't think how disappointed he will be if you do n't come to Cleveland.--I ca n't imagine why you should object to it . \" Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation ; and by changing the subject , put a stop to her entreaties . She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county , Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby 's general character , than could be gathered from the Middletons ' partial acquaintance with him ; and she was eager to gain from any one , such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne . She began by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland , and whether they were intimately acquainted with him . \" Oh dear , yes ; I know him extremely well , \" replied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not that I ever spoke to him , indeed ; but I have seen him for ever in town . Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham . Mama saw him here once before;-- but I was with my uncle at Weymouth . However , I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire , if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together . He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . I know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know . \" \" Upon my word , \" replied Elinor , \" you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . \" \" Do n't pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . I assure you I heard of it in my way through town . \" \" My dear Mrs. Palmer ! \" \" Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond - street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly . \" \" You surprise me very much . Colonel Brandon tell you of it ! Surely you must be mistaken . To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . \" \" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened . When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ' So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna . Is it true , pray ? for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately . ' \" \" And what did the Colonel say ? \" \" Oh -- he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain . It will be quite delightful , I declare ! When is it to take place ? \" \" Mr. Brandon was very well I hope ? \" \" Oh ! yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you . \" \" I am flattered by his commendation . He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . \" \" So do I.--He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull . Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body . \" \" Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? \" said Elinor . \" Oh ! yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you . Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister . She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . However , I do n't think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . \" Mrs. Palmer 's information respecting Willoughby was not very material ; but any testimony in his favour , however small , was pleasing to her . \" I am so glad we are got acquainted at last , \" continued Charlotte.--\"And now I hope we shall always be great friends . You ca n't think how much I longed to see you ! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! Nothing can be like it , to be sure ! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna . It is a sweet place , by all accounts . \" \" You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ? \" \" Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married.-- He was a particular friend of Sir John 's . I believe , \" she added in a low voice , \" he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could . Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much . But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . \" \" Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John 's proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ? \" \" Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things . He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school . However , I am much happier as I am . Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [21, 23], "text": "Mrs. Palmer"}, {"position": [39, 40], "text": "She"}, {"position": [59, 60], "text": "I"},
