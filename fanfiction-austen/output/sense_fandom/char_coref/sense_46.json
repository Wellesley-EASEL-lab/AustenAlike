{"document": "46 Marianne 's illness , though weakening in its kind , had not been long enough to make her recovery slow ; and with youth , natural strength , and her mother 's presence in aid , it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove , within four days after the arrival of the latter , into Mrs. Palmer 's dressing - room . When there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her . His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor 's conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation . Mrs. Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel 's behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned . At the end of another day or two , Marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours , Mrs. Dashwood , urged equally by her own and her daughter 's wishes , began to talk of removing to Barton . On HER measures depended those of her two friends ; Mrs. Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods ' stay ; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought , by their united request , to consider his own abode there as equally determinate , if not equally indispensable . At his and Mrs. Jennings 's united request in return , Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back , for the better accommodation of her sick child ; and the Colonel , at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings , whose active good - nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself , engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage , in the course of a few weeks . The day of separation and departure arrived ; and Marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half . Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed , and the others were left by themselves , to talk of the travellers , and feel their own dullness , till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions ; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford . The Dashwoods were two days on the road , and Marianne bore her journey on both , without essential fatigue . Every thing that the most zealous affection , the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable , was the office of each watchful companion , and each found their reward in her bodily ease , and her calmness of spirits . To Elinor , the observation of the latter was particularly grateful . She , who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering , oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of , nor fortitude to conceal , now saw with a joy , which no other could equally share , an apparent composure of mind , which , in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection , must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness . As they approached Barton , indeed , and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar , some painful recollection , she grew silent and thoughtful , and turning away her face from their notice , sat earnestly gazing through the window . But here , Elinor could neither wonder nor blame ; and when she saw , as she assisted Marianne from the carriage , that she had been crying , she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity , and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise . In the whole of her subsequent manner , she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion ; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting - room , than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness , as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.--She said little , but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness , and though a sigh sometimes escaped her , it never passed away without the atonement of a smile . After dinner she would try her piano - forte . She went to it ; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera , procured for her by Willoughby , containing some of their favourite duets , and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand - writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head , put the music aside , and after running over the keys for a minute , complained of feebleness in her fingers , and closed the instrument again ; declaring however with firmness as she did so , that she should in future practice much . The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms . On the contrary , with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest , she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit , anticipating the pleasure of Margaret 's return , and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored , of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society , as the only happiness worth a wish . \" When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength , \" said she , \" we will take long walks together every day . We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to Sir John 's new plantations at Barton Cross , and the Abbeyland ; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached . I know we shall be happy . I know the summer will pass happily away . I mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading . I have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study . Our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement . But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon . By reading only six hours a - day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve - month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want . \" Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this ; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining , now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self - control . Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled , and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne , and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity . Willing therefore to delay the evil hour , she resolved to wait till her sister 's health were more secure , before she appointed it . But the resolution was made only to be broken . Marianne had been two or three days at home , before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out . But at last a soft , genial morning appeared ; such as might tempt the daughter 's wishes and the mother 's confidence ; and Marianne , leaning on Elinor 's arm , was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue , in the lane before the house . The sisters set out at a pace , slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill , the important hill behind , when pausing with her eyes turned towards it , Marianne calmly said , \" There , exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand , \" on that projecting mound,--there I fell ; and there I first saw Willoughby . \" Her voice sunk with the word , but presently reviving she added , \" I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject , Elinor?\" -- hesitatingly it was said.--\"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now , I hope , as I ought to do . \"-- Elinor tenderly invited her to be open . \" As for regret , \" said Marianne , \" I have done with that , as far as HE is concerned . I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him , but what they are NOW.--At present , if I could be satisfied on one point , if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part , not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all , if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him , since the story of that unfortunate girl\"-- She stopt . Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered , \" If you could be assured of that , you think you should be easy . \" \" Yes . My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;-- for not only is it horrible to suspect a person , who has been what HE has been to ME , of such designs,--but what must it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine , but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to\"-- \" How then , \" asked her sister , \" would you account for his behaviour ? \" \" I would suppose him,--Oh , how gladly would I suppose him , only fickle , very , very fickle . \" Elinor said no more . She was debating within herself on the eligibility of beginning her story directly , or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;-- and they crept on for a few minutes in silence . \" I am not wishing him too much good , \" said Marianne at last with a sigh , \" when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own . He will suffer enough in them . \" \" Do you compare your conduct with his ? \" \" No . I compare it with what it ought to have been ; I compare it with yours . \" \" Our situations have borne little resemblance . \" \" They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not , my dearest Elinor , let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure . My illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection . Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect . I considered the past : I saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others . I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave . My illness , I well knew , had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health , as I had felt even at the time to be wrong . Had I died,--it would have been self - destruction . I did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my God , and to you all , did not kill me at once . Had I died,-- in what peculiar misery should I have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister!--You , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too ! How could you have consoled her!--I can not express my own abhorrence of myself . Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . Every body seemed injured by me . The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt . To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention.--To John , to Fanny,--yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . But you,--you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me . I , and only I , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before me ; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort ? Did I imitate your forbearance , or lessen your restraints , by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;-- not less when I knew you to be unhappy , than when I had believed you at ease , did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship ; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me , regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me , and leaving you , for or I professed an unbounded affection , to be miserable for my sake . \" Here ceased the rapid flow of her self - reproving spirit ; and Elinor , impatient to soothe , though too honest to flatter , gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved . Marianne pressed her hand and replied , \" You are very good.--The future must be my proof . I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it -- my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself . I shall now live solely for my family . You , my mother , and Margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you . > From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance . As for Willoughby -- to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle . His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions . But it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment . \" She paused -- and added in a low voice , \" If I could but know HIS heart , everything would become easy . \" Elinor , who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration , without feeling at all nearer decision than at first , heard this ; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing , resolution must do all , soon found herself leading to the fact . She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard . Marianne said not a word.--She trembled , her eyes were fixed on the ground , and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them . A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart , but she dared not urge one . She caught every syllable with panting eagerness ; her hand , unknowingly to herself , closely pressed her sister 's , and tears covered her cheeks . Elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but Willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged . As soon as they entered the house , Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears , \" Tell mama , \" withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs . Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought ; and with a mind anxiously pre - arranging its result , and a resolution of reviving the subject again , should Marianne fail to do it , she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Marianne"}, {"position": [18, 19], "text": "her"},
