{"document": "37 Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share . About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs. Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer , entered the drawing - room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying , \" Lord ! my dear Miss Dashwood ! have you heard the news ? \" \" No , ma'am . What is it ? \" \" Something so strange ! But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child . She was sure it was very ill -- it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear , ' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum-- ' and nurse said just the same . But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr. Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy . And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news . So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister 's indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . ' \" \" What ! is Fanny ill ? \" \" That is exactly what I said , my dear . ' Lord ! ' says I , ' is Mrs. Dashwood ill ? ' So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this . Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;-- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . ' Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on . Poor soul ! I pity HER . And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan , and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar . The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . Lord ! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it ! To have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same . He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care . I have no pity for either of them . I have no notion of people 's making such a to - do about money and greatness . There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord ! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . \" Here Mrs. Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs. Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it . She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy . What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself . For HIM she felt much compassion;-- for Lucy very little -- and it cost her some pains to procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all . As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject , Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion . No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward . Elinor 's office was a painful one.--She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister 's chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it . She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward 's engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne . Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively . Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered . But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither . Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she HAD loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself ! As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne 's feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment . The first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , \" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ? \" \" I have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement . \" At these words , Marianne 's eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter . After a pause of wonder , she exclaimed-- \" Four months!--Have you known of this four months ? \" Elinor confirmed it . \" What!--while attending me in all my misery , has this been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!\" -- \" It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse ! \" \" Four months!\" --cried Marianne again.--\"So calm!-- so cheerful!--how have you been supported?\" -- \" By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret . I owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and I owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy . \" Marianne seemed much struck . \" I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother , \" added Elinor ; \" and once or twice I have attempted it;-- but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you . \" \" Four months!--and yet you loved him!\" -- \" Yes . But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt . Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion . I would not have you suffer on my account ; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself . I have many things to support me . I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther . I acquit Edward of essential misconduct . I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so . Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one 's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.\" -- \" If such is your way of thinking , \" said Marianne , \" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension . \" \" I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph.-- This person 's suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW . The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No , Marianne.--THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy . \" -- Marianne was quite subdued.-- \" Oh ! Elinor , \" she cried , \" you have made me hate myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!-- you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away . \" The tenderest caresses followed this confession . In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make . She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard three times to say , \" Yes , ma'am . \"--She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward 's affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself . The next morning brought a farther trial of it , in a visit from their brother , who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair , and bring them news of his wife . \" You have heard , I suppose , \" said he with great solemnity , as soon as he was seated , \" of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday . \" They all looked their assent ; it seemed too awful a moment for speech . \" Your sister , \" he continued , \" has suffered dreadfully . Mrs. Ferrars too -- in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress -- but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome . Poor Fanny ! she was in hysterics all yesterday . But I would not alarm you too much . Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended ; her constitution is a good one , and her resolution equal to any thing . She has borne it all , with the fortitude of an angel ! She says she never shall think well of anybody again ; and one can not wonder at it , after being so deceived!-- meeting with such ingratitude , where so much kindness had been shewn , so much confidence had been placed ! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter . And now to be so rewarded ! ' I wish , with all my heart , ' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way , ' that we had asked your sisters instead of them . ' \" Here he stopped to be thanked ; which being done , he went on . \" What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered , when first Fanny broke it to her , is not to be described . While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such a suspicion could never have entered her head ! If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter . ' THERE , to be sure , ' said she , ' I might have thought myself safe . ' She was quite in an agony . We consulted together , however , as to what should be done , and at last she determined to send for Edward . He came . But I am sorry to relate what ensued . All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny 's entreaties , was of no avail . Duty , affection , every thing was disregarded . I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before . His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land - tax , brings in a good thousand a - year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it . \" Here Marianne , in an ecstasy of indignation , clapped her hands together , and cried , \" Gracious God ! can this be possible ! \" \" Well may you wonder , Marianne , \" replied her brother , \" at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these . Your exclamation is very natural . \" Marianne was going to retort , but she remembered her promises , and forbore . \" All this , however , \" he continued , \" was urged in vain . Edward said very little ; but what he did say , was in the most determined manner . Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement . He would stand to it , cost him what it might . \" \" Then , \" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity , no longer able to be silent , \" he has acted like an honest man ! I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal . I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . \" John Dashwood was greatly astonished ; but his nature was calm , not open to provocation , and he never wished to offend anybody , especially anybody of good fortune . He therefore replied , without any resentment , \" I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours , madam . Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible . And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle 's care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary . In short , I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for , Mrs. Jennings . We all wish her extremely happy ; and Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct throughout the whole , has been such as every conscientious , good mother , in like circumstances , would adopt . It has been dignified and liberal . Edward has drawn his own lot , and I fear it will be a bad one . \" Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension ; and Elinor 's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward , while braving his mother 's threats , for a woman who could not reward him . \" Well , sir , \" said Mrs. Jennings , \" and how did it end ? \" \" I am sorry to say , ma'am , in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother 's notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can make no inquiry . \" \" Poor young man!--and what is to become of him ? \" \" What , indeed , ma'am ! It is a melancholy consideration . Born to the prospect of such affluence ! I can not conceive a situation more deplorable . The interest of two thousand pounds -- how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a - year ( for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds , ) I can not picture to myself a more wretched condition . We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him . \" \" Poor young man ! \" cried Mrs. Jennings , \" I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . \" Elinor 's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it . \" If he would only have done as well by himself , \" said John Dashwood , \" as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody 's power to assist him . And there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all -- his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately , which might have been Edward 's , on proper conditions . I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business . \" \" Well ! \" said Mrs. Jennings , \" that is HER revenge . Everybody has a way of their own . But I do n't think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me . \" Marianne got up and walked about the room . \" Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man , \" continued John , \" than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ? Poor Edward ! I feel for him sincerely . \" A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion , concluded his visit ; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in Fanny 's indisposition , and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it , he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct , the Dashwoods ' , and Edward 's . Marianne 's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Mrs. Palmer"}, {"position": [14, 15], "text": "her"}, {"position": [14, 16], "text": "her mother"}, {"position":
