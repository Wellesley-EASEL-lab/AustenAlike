{"document": "41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life . Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas . So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood 's part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry . It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife 's indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions . Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike . Mrs. Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out . He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in . They walked up stairs in to the drawing - room.--Nobody was there . \" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , \" said he:--\"I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it , indeed . NOW especially there can not be -- but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?\" -- Elinor made what excuse she could for her . \" I am not sorry to see you alone , \" he replied , \" for I have a good deal to say to you . This living of Colonel Brandon's -- can it be true?--has he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . \" \" It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward . \" \" Really!--Well , this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this ? \" \" About two hundred a year . \" \" Very well -- and for the next presentation to a living of that value -- supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon -- he might have got I dare say -- fourteen hundred pounds . And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person 's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of Colonel Brandon 's sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern!--Well , I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . I suppose , however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be THIS . Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it.--Aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it . \" Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority . \" It is truly astonishing!\" --he cried , after hearing what she said--\"what could be the Colonel 's motive ? \" \" A very simple one -- to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . \" \" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear it much talked of . \" Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished . \" Mrs. Ferrars , \" added he , lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject , \" knows nothing about it at present , and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.-- When the marriage takes place , I fear she must hear of it all . \" \" But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise . Surely , after doing so , she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account-- she can not be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent ! \" \" Ah ! Elinor , \" said John , \" your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature . When Edward 's unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible . Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . \" \" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time . \" \" You wrong her exceedingly . Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world . \" Elinor was silent . \" We think NOW,\"--said Mr. Dashwood , after a short pause , \" of ROBERT 'S marrying Miss Morton . \" Elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother 's tone , calmly replied , \" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair . \" \" Choice!--how do you mean ? \" \" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . \" \" Certainly , there can be no difference ; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other . \" Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent.--His reflections ended thus . \" Of ONE thing , my dear sister , \" kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper,--\"I may assure you;-- and I WILL do it , because I know it must gratify you . I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter DID , and I have it from her -- That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does . I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light-- a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all . ' It would have been beyond comparison , ' she said , ' the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse . ' But however , all that is quite out of the question -- not to be thought of or mentioned-- as to any attachment you know -- it never could be -- all that is gone by . But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you . Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor . There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well -- quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered . Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately ? \" Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars . After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart . They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves , before he began to speak of Edward ; for he , too , had heard of the living , and was very inquisitive on the subject . Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on HIM . He laughed most immoderately . The idea of Edward 's being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage - house , diverted him beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous . Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of her 's , but by his own sensibility . \" We may treat it as a joke , \" said he , at last , recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--\"but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business . Poor Edward ! he is ruined for ever . I am extremely sorry for it-- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!-- to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . I could not believe it.-- My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again . ' That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . My poor mother was half frantic . \" \" Have you ever seen the lady ? \" \" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her . The merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty.-- I remember her perfectly . Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward . I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier -- I think it is most probable -- that something might have been hit on . I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light . ' My dear fellow , ' I should have said , ' consider what you are doing . You are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving . ' I can not help thinking , in short , that means might have been found . But now it is all too late . He must be starved , you know;-- that is certain ; absolutely starved . \" He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject . But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family , Elinor could see its influence on her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself . She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Edward"},
