{"document": "7 Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage . The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill . The house was large and handsome ; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . The former was for Sir John 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady . They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood . It was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass . Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother . He hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources . Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while Sir John 's independent employments were in existence only half the time . Continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of Sir John , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife . Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties . But Sir John 's satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased . He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen . The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton . The Miss Dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected . It was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person . The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor . Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John , who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . They would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay . He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again . He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements . Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave . His appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike . There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother - in - law was interesting . Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves . In the evening , as Marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . The instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and Marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother 's account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it . Marianne 's performance was highly applauded . Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one 's attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished . Colonel Brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures . He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste . His pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment . She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel 's advanced state of life which humanity required .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [12, 14], "text": "The ladies"}], "name": "The ladies"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [33, 34], "text": "home"}, {"position": [41, 43], "text": "The house"}, {"position": [89, 91], "text": "the house"}, {"position": [220, 221], "text": "home"}, {"position": [310, 312], "text": "his house"}, {"position": [576, 578], "text": "the house"}, {"position": [586, 588], "text": "Barton Park"}, {"position": [654, 656], "text": "the park"}], "name": "The house"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [65, 67], "text": "Sir John"}, {"position": [75, 76], "text": "his"}, {"position": [157, 159], "text": "Sir John"}, {"position": [168, 169], "text": "He"}, {"position": [204, 206], "text": "Sir John"}, {"position": [240, 242], "text": "Sir John"}, {"position": [251, 252], "text": "his"}, {"position": [289, 291], "text": "Sir John"}, {"position": [300, 301], "text": "he"}, {"position": [305, 306], "text": "him"}, {"position": [310, 311], "text": "his"}, {"position": [323, 324], "text": "he"}, {"position": [326, 327], "text": "He"}, {"position": [342, 343], "text": "he"}, {"position": [361, 362], "text": "his"}, {"position": [398, 399], "text": "him"}, {"position": [406, 407], "text": "he"}, {"position": [412, 413], "text": "he"}, {"position": [417, 418], "text": "his"}, {"position": [438, 439], "text": "his"}, {"position": [467, 468], "text": "his"}, {"position": [470, 471], "text": "him"}, {"position": [495, 496], "text": "his"}, {"position": [498, 499], "text": "he"}, {"position": [517, 518], "text": "his"}, {"position": [520, 521], "text": "he"}, {"position": [534, 535], "text": "he"}, {"position": [561, 562], "text": "his"}, {"position": [579, 581], "text": "Sir John"}, {"position": [594, 595], "text": "he"}, {"position": [615, 616], "text": "him"}, {"position": [637, 638], "text": "he"}, {"position": [645, 646], "text": "himself"}, {"position": [667, 668], "text": "He"}, {"position": [690, 691], "text": "He"}, {"position": [744, 745], "text": "he"}, {"position": [928, 930], "text": "Sir John"}, {"position": [969, 970], "text": "His"}, {"position": [979, 980], "text": "his"}, {"position": [994, 995], "text": "he"}, {"position": [1007, 1008], "text": "his"}, {"position": [1013, 1014], "text": "his"}, {"position": [1019, 1020], "text": "his"}, {"position": [1072, 1074], "text": "Sir John"}, {"position": [1075, 1076], "text": "his"}, {"position": [1245, 1247], "text": "Sir John"}, {"position": [1250, 1251], "text": "his"}, {"position": [1263, 1264], "text": "his"}, {"position": [1277, 1278], "text": "him"}], "name": "Sir John"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [49, 51], "text": "the Middletons"}, {"position": [78, 79], "text": "They"}], "name": "the Middletons"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [75, 77], "text": "his lady"}, {"position": [163, 165], "text": "Lady Middleton"}, {"position": [174, 175], "text": "she"}, {"position": [176, 177], "text": "her"}, {"position": [186, 188], "text": "Lady Middleton"}, {"position": [196, 197], "text": "her"}, {"position": [251, 253], "text": "his wife"}, {"position": [254, 256], "text": "Lady Middleton"}, {"position": [257, 258], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [262, 263], "text": "her"}, {"position": [268, 269], "text": "her"}, {"position": [279, 280], "text": "her"}, {"position": [721, 723], "text": "Lady Middleton"}, {"position": [721, 725], "text": "Lady Middleton 's mother"}, {"position": [736, 737], "text": "she"}, {"position": [768, 770], "text": "their mother"}, {"position": [789, 791], "text": "Mrs. Jennings"}, {"position": [792, 794], "text": "Lady Middleton"}, {"position": [792, 796], "text": "Lady Middleton 's mother"}, {"position": [824, 825], "text": "She"}, {"position": [918, 920], "text": "Mrs. Jennings"}, {"position": [945, 947], "text": "Lady Middleton"}, {"position": [954, 956], "text": "Mrs. Jennings"}, {"position": [958, 960], "text": "Lady Middleton"}, {"position": [958, 962], "text": "Lady Middleton 's mother"}, {"position": [1048, 1050], "text": "Lady Middleton"}, {"position": [1075, 1081], "text": "his mother -
