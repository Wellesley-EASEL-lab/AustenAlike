{"document": "33 After some opposition , Marianne yielded to her sister 's entreaties , and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour . She expressly conditioned , however , for paying no visits , and would do no more than accompany them to Gray 's in Sackville Street , where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old - fashioned jewels of her mother . When they stopped at the door , Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call ; and as she had no business at Gray 's , it was resolved , that while her young friends transacted their 's , she should pay her visit and return for them . On ascending the stairs , the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before them in the room , that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders ; and they were obliged to wait . All that could be done was , to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession ; one gentleman only was standing there , and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch . But the correctness of his eye , and the delicacy of his taste , proved to be beyond his politeness . He was giving orders for a toothpick - case for himself , and till its size , shape , and ornaments were determined , all of which , after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick - case in the shop , were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy , he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies , than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares ; a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face , of strong , natural , sterling insignificance , though adorned in the first style of fashion . Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment , on this impertinent examination of their features , and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick - cases presented to his inspection , by remaining unconscious of it all ; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself , and be as ignorant of what was passing around her , in Mr. Gray 's shop , as in her own bedroom . At last the affair was decided . The ivory , the gold , and the pearls , all received their appointment , and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick - case , drew on his gloves with leisurely care , and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods , but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration , walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference . Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward , was on the point of concluding it , when another gentleman presented himself at her side . She turned her eyes towards his face , and found him with some surprise to be her brother . Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray 's shop . John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again ; it rather gave them satisfaction ; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive . Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days . \" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday , \" said he , \" but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars . Harry was vastly pleased . THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal . But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings . I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to THEM . As my mother - in - law 's relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand . \" \" Excellent indeed . Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . \" \" I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . \" Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother ; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him , by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings 's servant , who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door . Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs , was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage , and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day , took leave . His visit was duly paid . He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister - in - law , for not coming too ; \" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . \" Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton . The weather was remarkably fine , and she readily consented . As soon as they were out of the house , his enquiries began . \" Who is Colonel Brandon ? Is he a man of fortune ? \" \" Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . \" \" I am glad of it . He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . \" \" Me , brother ! what do you mean ? \" \" He likes you . I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . What is the amount of his fortune ? \" \" I believe about two thousand a year . \" \" Two thousand a - year ; \" and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity , he added , \" Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much , for your sake . \" \" Indeed I believe you , \" replied Elinor ; \" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME . \" \" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side -- in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable-- you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family . It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that\"--lowering his voice to an important whisper--\"will be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES . \" Recollecting himself , however , he added , \" That is , I mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you . And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . \" Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer . \" It would be something remarkable , now , \" he continued , \" something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . \" \" Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , \" said Elinor , with resolution , \" going to be married ? \" \" It is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . He has a most excellent mother . Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds . A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time . A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit . To give you another instance of her liberality:--The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny 's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . And extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here . \" He paused for her assent and compassion ; and she forced herself to say , \" Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . \" \" Not so large , I dare say , as many people suppose . I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live . The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it . I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . A man must pay for his convenience ; and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money . \" \" More than you think it really and intrinsically worth . \" \" Why , I hope not that . I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker 's hands , I must have sold out to very great loss . \" Elinor could only smile . \" Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away . You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars 's kindness is . \" \" Certainly , \" said Elinor ; \" and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances . \" \" Another year or two may do much towards it , \" he gravely replied ; \" but however there is still a great deal to be done . There is not a stone laid of Fanny 's green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out . \" \" Where is the green - house to be ? \" \" Upon the knoll behind the house . The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . \" Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself ; and was very thankful that Marianne was not present , to share the provocation . Having now said enough to make his poverty clear , and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear - rings for each of his sisters , in his next visit at Gray 's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn , and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings . \" She seems a most valuable woman indeed -- Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.-- She must have a great deal to leave . \" \" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . \" \" But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . Few people of common prudence will do THAT ; and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . \" \" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? \" \" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard . Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises . \" \" But she raises none in those most concerned . Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far . \" \" Why , to be sure , \" said he , seeming to recollect himself , \" people have little , have very little in their power . But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin . Is she ill ? \" \" She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks . \" \" I am sorry for that . At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever ! Her 's has been a very short one ! She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better . Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . \" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect . They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home , and Sir John came in before their visit ended . Abundance of civilities passed on all sides . Sir John was ready to like anybody , and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses , he soon set him down as a very good - natured fellow : while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having ; and Mr. Dashwood went away delighted with both . \" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , \" said he , as he walked back with his sister . \" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [5, 6], "text": "Marianne"}, {"position": [8, 9], "text": "her"}, {"position": [19, 20],
