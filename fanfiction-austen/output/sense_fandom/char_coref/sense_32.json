{"document": "32 When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister , as they very soon were , the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see . Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it , for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention , made neither objection nor remark , attempted no vindication of Willoughby , and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible . But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind , though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it , in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called , in her speaking to him , even voluntarily speaking , with a kind of compassionate respect , and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before , she did not see her less wretched . Her mind did become settled , but it was settled in a gloomy dejection . She felt the loss of Willoughby 's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart ; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams , the misery of that poor girl , and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself , preyed altogether so much on her spirits , that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor ; and , brooding over her sorrows in silence , gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them . To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor 's letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said ; of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne 's , and an indignation even greater than Elinor 's . Long letters from her , quickly succeeding each other , arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought ; to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne , and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune . Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne 's affliction be , when her mother could talk of fortitude ! mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets , which SHE could wish her not to indulge ! Against the interest of her own individual comfort , Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where , at that time , than at Barton , where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner , by constantly placing Willoughby before her , such as she had always seen him there . She recommended it to her daughters , therefore , by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings ; the length of which , though never exactly fixed , had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks . A variety of occupations , of objects , and of company , which could not be procured at Barton , would be inevitable there , and might yet , she hoped , cheat Marianne , at times , into some interest beyond herself , and even into some amusement , much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her . From all danger of seeing Willoughby again , her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country , since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends . Design could never bring them in each other 's way : negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise ; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton , where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage , which Mrs. Dashwood , from foreseeing at first as a probable event , had brought herself to expect as a certain one . She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son - in - law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother . Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother 's opinion , and she submitted to it therefore without opposition , though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected , though she felt it to be entirely wrong , formed on mistaken grounds , and that by requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness , the personal sympathy of her mother , and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment 's rest . But it was a matter of great consolation to her , that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister ; and Elinor , on the other hand , suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely , comforted herself by thinking , that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness , it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire . Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby 's name mentioned , was not thrown away . Marianne , though without knowing it herself , reaped all its advantage ; for neither Mrs. Jennings , nor Sir John , nor even Mrs. Palmer herself , ever spoke of him before her . Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself , but that was impossible , and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all . Sir John , could not have thought it possible . \" A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly 's puppies ! and this was the end of it ! \" Mrs. Palmer , in her way , was equally angry . \" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . \" The rest of Mrs. Palmer 's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage , and communicating them to Elinor . She could soon tell at what coachmaker 's the new carriage was building , by what painter Mr. Willoughby 's portrait was drawn , and at what warehouse Miss Grey 's clothes might be seen . The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor 's spirits , oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others . It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle of friends : a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars , or any anxiety for her sister 's health . Every qualification is raised at times , by the circumstances of the moment , to more than its real value ; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good - breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good - nature . Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day , or twice , if the subject occurred very often , by saying , \" It is very shocking , indeed ! \" and by the means of this continual though gentle vent , was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion , but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter ; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex , and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other , she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies , and therefore determined ( though rather against the opinion of Sir John ) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune , to leave her card with her as soon as she married . Colonel Brandon 's delicate , unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood . He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister 's disappointment , by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it , and they always conversed with confidence . His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations , was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him , and the gentleness of her voice whenever ( though it did not often happen ) she was obliged , or could oblige herself to speak to him . THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good - will towards himself , and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter ; but Mrs. Jennings , who knew nothing of all this , who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever , and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself , nor commission her to make it for him , began , at the end of two days , to think that , instead of Midsummer , they would not be married till Michaelmas , and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all . The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry - tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to HER ; and Mrs. Jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars . Early in February , within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby 's letter , Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married . She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself , as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over , as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers , which she saw her eagerly examining every morning . She received the news with resolute composure ; made no observation on it , and at first shed no tears ; but after a short time they would burst out , and for the rest of the day , she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event . The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married ; and Elinor now hoped , as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them , to prevail on her sister , who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell , to go out again by degrees as she had done before . About this time the two Miss Steeles , lately arrived at their cousin 's house in Bartlett 's Buildings , Holburn , presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets ; and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality . Elinor only was sorry to see them . Their presence always gave her pain , and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town . \" I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL , \" said she repeatedly , with a strong emphasis on the word . \" But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD . \" Elinor perfectly understood her , and was forced to use all her self - command to make it appear that she did NOT . \" Well , my dear , \" said Mrs. Jennings , \" and how did you travel ? \" \" Not in the stage , I assure you , \" replied Miss Steele , with quick exultation ; \" we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr. Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we 'd join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . \" \" Oh , oh ! \" cried Mrs. Jennings ; \" very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you . \" \" There now , \" said Miss Steele , affectedly simpering , \" everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I can not think why . My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour 's end to another . ' Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy , ' my cousin said t'other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I -- I can not think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine . \" \" Aye , aye , that is very pretty talking -- but it wo n't do-- the Doctor is the man , I see . \" \" No , indeed ! \" replied her cousin , with affected earnestness , \" and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . \" Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she certainly would NOT , and Miss Steele was made completely happy . \" I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , \" said Lucy , returning , after a cessation of hostile hints , to the charge . \" No , I do not think we shall . \" \" Oh , yes , I dare say you will . \" Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition . \" What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! \" \" Long a time , indeed ! \" interposed Mrs. Jennings . \" Why , their visit is but just begun ! \" Lucy was silenced . \" I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , \" said Miss Steele . \" I am sorry she is not well-- \" for Marianne had left the room on their arrival . \" You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . \" \" Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word . \" Elinor , with great civility , declined the proposal . Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed , or in her dressing gown , and therefore not able to come to them . \" Oh , if that 's all , \" cried Miss Steele , \" we can just as well go and see HER . \" Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper ; but she was saved the trouble of checking it , by Lucy 's sharp reprimand , which now , as on many occasions , though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister , was of advantage in governing those of the other .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [10, 12], "text": "Miss Dashwood"}, {"position": [13,
