{"document": "35 Elinor 's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of Edward and herself , had he been otherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars 's creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion . Or at least , if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward 's being fettered to Lucy , she determined , that had Lucy been more amiable , she OUGHT to have rejoiced . She wondered that Lucy 's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown . But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy 's eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was . The chance proved a lucky one , for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived , carried Mrs. Jennings away . \" My dear friend , \" cried Lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , \" I come to talk to you of my happiness . Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars 's way of treating me yesterday ? So exceeding affable as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;-- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . Now was not it so?-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? \" \" She was certainly very civil to you . \" \" Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal more . Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same -- all sweetness and affability ! \" Elinor wished to talk of something else , but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness ; and Elinor was obliged to go on.-- \" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , \" said she , \" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was not the case\"-- \" I guessed you would say so\"--replied Lucy quickly--\"but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . You sha n't talk me out of my satisfaction . I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think . Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . They are both delightful women , indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! \" To this Elinor had no answer to make , and did not attempt any . \" Are you ill , Miss Dashwood?--you seem low -- you do n't speak;--sure you an't well . \" \" I never was in better health . \" \" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it . I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . \" -- Elinor tried to make a civil answer , though doubting her own success . But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , \" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.-- They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high . \" But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister . Lucy continued . \" I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me . If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . I could not have stood it . For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . \" Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door 's being thrown open , the servant 's announcing Mr. Ferrars , and Edward 's immediately walking in . It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so . They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it . The very circumstance , in its unpleasantest form , which they would each have been most anxious to avoid , had fallen on them.--They were not only all three together , but were together without the relief of any other person . The ladies recovered themselves first . It was not Lucy 's business to put herself forward , and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up . She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness , and after slightly addressing him , said no more . But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment 's recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them . She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street . She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her . Her manners gave some re - assurance to Edward , and he had courage enough to sit down ; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion , which the case rendered reasonable , though his sex might make it rare ; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy 's , nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor 's . Lucy , with a demure and settled air , seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others , and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that WAS said , proceeded from Elinor , who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother 's health , their coming to town , & c. which Edward ought to have inquired about , but never did . Her exertions did not stop here ; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine , under pretence of fetching Marianne , to leave the others by themselves ; and she really did it , and THAT in the handsomest manner , for she loitered away several minutes on the landing - place , with the most high - minded fortitude , before she went to her sister . When that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease ; for Marianne 's joy hurried her into the drawing - room immediately . Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings , strong in itself , and strongly spoken . She met him with a hand that would be taken , and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister . \" Dear Edward ! \" she cried , \" this is a moment of great happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing ? \" Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt . Again they all sat down , and for a moment or two all were silent ; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness , sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor , regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy 's unwelcome presence . Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne 's altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her . \" Oh , do n't think of me ! \" she replied with spirited earnestness , though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke , \" do n't think of MY health . Elinor is well , you see . That must be enough for us both . \" This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy , nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy , who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression . \" Do you like London ? \" said Edward , willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject . \" Not at all . I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none . The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven ! you are what you always were ! \" She paused -- no one spoke . \" I think , Elinor , \" she presently added , \" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton . In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . \" Poor Edward muttered something , but what it was , nobody knew , not even himself . But Marianne , who saw his agitation , and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself , was perfectly satisfied , and soon talked of something else . \" We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday ! So dull , so wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . \" And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever , and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother , till they were more in private . \" But why were you not there , Edward?--Why did you not come ? \" \" I was engaged elsewhere . \" \" Engaged ! But what was that , when such friends were to be met ? \" \" Perhaps , Miss Marianne , \" cried Lucy , eager to take some revenge on her , \" you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great . \" Elinor was very angry , but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting ; for she calmly replied , \" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation . \" The nature of her commendation , in the present case , however , happened to be particularly ill - suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors , and was so very unexhilarating to Edward , that he very soon got up to go away . \" Going so soon ! \" said Marianne ; \" my dear Edward , this must not be . \" And drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer . But even this encouragement failed , for he would go ; and Lucy , who would have outstaid him , had his visit lasted two hours , soon afterwards went away . \" What can bring her here so often ? \" said Marianne , on her leaving them . \" Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward ! \" \" Why so?--we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any . It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . \" Marianne looked at her steadily , and said , \" You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . \" She then left the room ; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more , for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy , she could give no information that would convince Marianne ; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be , she was obliged to submit to it . All that she could hope , was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne 's mistaken warmth , nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting -- and this she had every reason to expect .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [10, 11], "text": "She"}, {"position": [14,
