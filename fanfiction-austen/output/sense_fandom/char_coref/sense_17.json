{"document": "17 Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural . Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder . He received the kindest welcome from her ; and shyness , coldness , reserve could not stand against such a reception . They had begun to fail him before he entered the house , and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood . Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters , without extending the passion to her ; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself . His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all , and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible . He was not in spirits , however ; he praised their house , admired its prospect , was attentive , and kind ; but still he was not in spirits . The whole family perceived it , and Mrs. Dashwood , attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother , sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents . \" What are Mrs. Ferrars 's views for you at present , Edward ? \" said she , when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire ; \" are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? \" \" No . I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! \" \" But how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter . \" \" I shall not attempt it . I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall . Thank Heaven ! I can not be forced into genius and eloquence . \" \" You have no ambition , I well know . Your wishes are all moderate . \" \" As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe . I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way . Greatness will not make me so . \" \" Strange that it would ! \" cried Marianne . \" What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ? \" \" Grandeur has but little , \" said Elinor , \" but wealth has much to do with it . \" \" Elinor , for shame ! \" said Marianne , \" money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it . Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . \" \" Perhaps , \" said Elinor , smiling , \" we may come to the same point . YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ? \" \" About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than THAT . \" Elinor laughed . \" TWO thousand a year ! ONE is my wealth ! I guessed how it would end . \" \" And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income , \" said Marianne . \" A family can not well be maintained on a smaller . I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . \" Elinor smiled again , to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna . \" Hunters ! \" repeated Edward--\"but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt . \" Marianne coloured as she replied , \" But most people do . \" \" I wish , \" said Margaret , striking out a novel thought , \" that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! \" \" Oh that they would ! \" cried Marianne , her eyes sparkling with animation , and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness . \" We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose , \" said Elinor , \" in spite of the insufficiency of wealth . \" \" Oh dear ! \" cried Margaret , \" how happy I should be ! I wonder what I should do with it ! \" Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point . \" I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself , \" said Mrs. Dashwood , \" if my children were all to be rich my help . \" \" You must begin your improvements on this house , \" observed Elinor , \" and your difficulties will soon vanish . \" \" What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London , \" said Edward , \" in such an event ! What a happy day for booksellers , music - sellers , and print - shops ! You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you -- and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her . And books!--Thomson , Cowper , Scott -- she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree . Should not you , Marianne ? Forgive me , if I am very saucy . But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes . \" \" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times . You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it , at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books . \" \" And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs . \" \" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . \" \" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? \" \" Undoubtedly . At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them . \" \" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , \" said Elinor , \" she is not at all altered . \" \" She is only grown a little more grave than she was . \" \" Nay , Edward , \" said Marianne , \" you need not reproach me . You are not very gay yourself . \" \" Why should you think so ! \" replied he , with a sigh . \" But gaiety never was a part of MY character . \" \" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne 's , \" said Elinor ; \" I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry . \" \" I believe you are right , \" he replied , \" and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl . \" \" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , \" said Elinor , \" in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge . \" \" But I thought it was right , Elinor , \" said Marianne , \" to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people . I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . This has always been your doctrine , I am sure . \" \" No , Marianne , never . My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding . All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . You must not confound my meaning . I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? \" \" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , \" said Edward to Elinor , \" Do you gain no ground ? \" \" Quite the contrary , \" replied Elinor , looking expressively at Marianne . \" My judgment , \" he returned , \" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister 's . I never wish to offend , but I am so foolishly shy , that I often seem negligent , when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness . I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! \" \" Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , \" said Elinor . \" She knows her own worth too well for false shame , \" replied Edward . \" Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . \" \" But you would still be reserved , \" said Marianne , \" and that is worse . \" Edward started--\"Reserved ! Am I reserved , Marianne ? \" \" Yes , very . \" \" I do not understand you , \" replied he , colouring . \" Reserved!--how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ? What can you suppose ? \" Elinor looked surprised at his emotion ; but trying to laugh off the subject , she said to him , \" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? \" Edward made no answer . His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent -- and he sat for some time silent and dull .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 12], "text": "him"}, {"position":
