Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas . So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood 's part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry .

Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again .

Mrs. Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out .
