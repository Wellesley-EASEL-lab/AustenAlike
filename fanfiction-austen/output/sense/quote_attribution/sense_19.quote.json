Edward 's marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain , as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance . As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs. Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known . The continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark ."}, {"position": [3027, 3050], "text": "\" The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two - penny post from Lucy herself .

We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it .

She sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , Barton must do it . Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March , for the Easter holidays ; and Mrs. Jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them . This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure . When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious . \""}, {"position": [3972, 3983], "text": "\" No , I can not go to Cleveland . \"--"}, {"position": [3987, 3992], "text": "\" said Elinor gently ,"}, {"position": [4008, 4009], "text": "\""}, {"position": [4041, 4298], "text": "\" Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;--represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day 's journey ; and their mother 's servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ' time . As Marianne 's affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started . Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland . Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother 's concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton ."}, {"position": [4371, 4701], "text": "\" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . This set the matter beyond a doubt . She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest . They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne 's performance brought her these words in the Colonel 's calm voice,--"}, {"position": [4825, 4837], "text": ", \" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you"}, {"position": [4981, 5254], "text": ". \" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied , with great feeling,--\"of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to .
