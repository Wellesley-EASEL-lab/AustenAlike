The idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them . Willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked Marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of Colonel Brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . They contained a noble piece of water ; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning 's amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure . To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;-- and Mrs. Dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home . 13 Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected . She was prepared to be wet through , fatigued , and frightened ; but the event was still more unfortunate , for they did not go at all . By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park , where they were to breakfast . The morning was rather favourable , though it had rained all night , as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky , and the sun frequently appeared . They were all in high spirits and good humour , eager to be happy , and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise .
