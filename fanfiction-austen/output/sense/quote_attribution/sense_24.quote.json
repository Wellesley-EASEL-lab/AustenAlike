She almost ran out of the room , and as soon as the door was closed , burst into tears of joy , which at first she thought would never cease . Edward , who had till then looked any where , rather than at her , saw her hurry away , and perhaps saw-- or even heard , her emotion ; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie , which no remarks , no inquiries , no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate , and at last , without saying a word , quitted the room , and walked out towards the village -- leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation , so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures . 49 Unaccountable , however , as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family , it was certain that Edward was free ; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre - determined by all;--for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement , contracted without his mother 's consent , as he had already done for more than four years , nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of THAT , than the immediate contraction of another . His errand at Barton , in fact , was a simple one . It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question , it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did , so much in need of encouragement and fresh air . How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told . This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother 's consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men . His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful . He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits . He was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;-- and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire . He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before . His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty - four . \""}], "Edward": [{"position": [1964, 1968], "text": "said he , \""}, {"position": [2339, 2998], "text": "The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods , was such -- so great -- as promised them all , the satisfaction of a sleepless night . Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both . Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears . Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil . But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably released from his former engagement , saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity;-- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart . Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor 's company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different . Between THEM no subject is finished , no communication is even made , till it has been made at least twenty times over . Lucy 's marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor 's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard . How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out . To her own heart it was a delightful affair , to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but to her reason , her judgment , it was completely a puzzle . Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest . Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother 's affairs might have done , if applied to in time .

Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance .

He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives .
