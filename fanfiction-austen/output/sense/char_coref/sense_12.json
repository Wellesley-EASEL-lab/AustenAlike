{"document": "24 In a firm , though cautious tone , Elinor thus began . \" I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . \" \" Thank you , \" cried Lucy warmly , \" for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday . \" \" Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me , \" and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity , \" nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ? \" \" And yet I do assure you , \" replied Lucy , her little sharp eyes full of meaning , \" there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . \" \" Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr. Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . \" \" He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward 's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . \" \" That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your 's . If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ' engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . \" Lucy here looked up ; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency . \" Edward 's love for me , \" said Lucy , \" has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment 's alarm on that account from the first . \" Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion . Lucy went on . \" I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . \" \" All this , \" thought Elinor , \" is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . \" \" But what , \" said she after a short silence , \" are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars 's death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? \" \" If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward 's sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . \" \" And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason . \" Lucy looked at Elinor again , and was silent . \" Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? \" asked Elinor . \" Not at all -- I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother -- silly and a great coxcomb . \" \" A great coxcomb ! \" repeated Miss Steele , whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne 's music.-- \" Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say . \" \" No sister , \" cried Lucy , \" you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs . \" \" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood 's is not , \" said Mrs. Jennings , laughing heartily ; \" for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes . \" \" Oh , \" cried Miss Steele , looking significantly round at them , \" I dare say Lucy 's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood 's . \" Elinor blushed in spite of herself . Lucy bit her lip , and looked angrily at her sister . A mutual silence took place for some time . Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone , though Marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto-- \" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . \" \" I should always be happy , \" replied Elinor , \" to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood -- THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband . \" \" But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward 's going into orders . \" \" Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . \" They were again silent for many minutes . At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh , \" I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ? \" \" No , \" answered Elinor , with a smile , which concealed very agitated feelings , \" on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . \" \" Indeed you wrong me , \" replied Lucy , with great solemnity ; \" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately . \" Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward 's future wife , and replied , \" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . \" \" ' Tis because you are an indifferent person , \" said Lucy , with some pique , and laying a particular stress on those words , \" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . \" Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this , lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve ; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again . Another pause therefore of many minutes ' duration , succeeded this speech , and Lucy was still the first to end it . \" Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? \" said she with all her accustomary complacency . \" Certainly not . \" \" I am sorry for that , \" returned the other , while her eyes brightened at the information , \" it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! But I dare say you will go for all that . To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them . \" \" It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . \" \" How unlucky that is ! I had quite depended upon meeting you there . Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . \" Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary . From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself . The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied . Their favour increased ; they could not be spared ; Sir John would not hear of their going ; and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter , in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately , which was in full force at the end of every week , they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park , and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance . 25 Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends , she was not without a settled habitation of her own . Since the death of her husband , who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town , she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square . Towards this home , she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts , and thither she one day abruptly , and very unexpectedly by them , asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her . Elinor , without observing the varying complexion of her sister , and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan , immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both , in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations . The reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year . Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise , and repeated her invitation immediately . \" Oh , Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it . Do n't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n't put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . \" \" I have a notion , \" said Sir John , \" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it . \" \" Nay , \" cried Mrs. Jennings , \" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . \" \" I thank you , ma'am , sincerely thank you , \" said Marianne , with warmth : \" your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,--I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . \" Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother 's decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London . That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness . On being informed of the invitation , Mrs. Dashwood , persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters , and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself , how much the heart of Marianne was in it , would not hear of their declining the offer upon HER account ; insisted on their both accepting it directly ; and then began to foresee , with her usual cheerfulness , a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all , from this separation . \" I am delighted with the plan , \" she cried , \" it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . \" \" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , \" said Elinor , \" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . \" Marianne 's countenance sunk . \" And what , \" said Mrs. Dashwood , \" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? Do let me hear a word about the expense of it . \" \" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings 's heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence . \" \" That is very true , \" replied her mother , \" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton . \" \" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , \" said Marianne , \" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . \" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . \" I will have you BOTH go , \" said Mrs. Dashwood ; \" these objections are nonsensical . You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . \" Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother 's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , \" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . \" Mrs. Dashwood smiled , and said nothing . Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue . After very little farther discourse , it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted . Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great deal of joy , and many assurances of kindness and care ; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her . Sir John was delighted ; for to a man , whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone , the acquisition of two , to the number of inhabitants in London , was something . Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted , which was putting herself rather out of her way ; and as for the Miss Steeles , especially Lucy , they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them . Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel . With regard to herself , it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not , and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence . Marianne 's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness , so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone . Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive . Her mother 's affliction was hardly less , and Elinor was the only one of the three , who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal . Their departure took place in the first week in January . The Middletons were to follow in about a week . The Miss Steeles kept their station at the park , and were to quit it only with the rest of the family .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 10], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [14, 15],
