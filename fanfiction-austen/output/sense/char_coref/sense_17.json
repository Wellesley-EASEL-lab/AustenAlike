{"document": "34 Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband 's judgment , that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter ; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former , even the woman with whom her sisters were staying , by no means unworthy her notice ; and as for Lady Middleton , she found her one of the most charming women in the world ! Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood . There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides , which mutually attracted them ; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor , and a general want of understanding . The same manners , however , which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings , and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud - looking woman of uncordial address , who met her husband 's sisters without any affection , and almost without having anything to say to them ; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street , she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence . Elinor wanted very much to know , though she did not chuse to ask , whether Edward was then in town ; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her , till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on , or till her husband 's expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered ; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other , that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion . The intelligence however , which SHE would not give , soon flowed from another quarter . Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor 's compassion on being unable to see Edward , though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood . He dared not come to Bartlett 's Buildings for fear of detection , and though their mutual impatience to meet , was not to be told , they could do nothing at present but write . Edward assured them himself of his being in town , within a very short time , by twice calling in Berkeley Street . Twice was his card found on the table , when they returned from their morning 's engagements . Elinor was pleased that he had called ; and still more pleased that she had missed him . The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons , that , though not much in the habit of giving anything , they determined to give them-- a dinner ; and soon after their acquaintance began , invited them to dine in Harley Street , where they had taken a very good house for three months . Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise , and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon , who , always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were , received his eager civilities with some surprise , but much more pleasure . They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars ; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party . The expectation of seeing HER , however , was enough to make her interested in the engagement ; for though she could now meet Edward 's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction , though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself , her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars , her curiosity to know what she was like , was as lively as ever . The interest with which she thus anticipated the party , was soon afterwards increased , more powerfully than pleasantly , by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it . So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton , so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her , that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant , and her sister not even genteel , she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street ; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles , as soon as the Dashwoods ' invitation was known , that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place . Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood , as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother , might not have done much , however , towards procuring them seats at her table ; but as Lady Middleton 's guests they must be welcome ; and Lucy , who had long wanted to be personally known to the family , to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties , and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them , had seldom been happier in her life , than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood 's card . On Elinor its effect was very different . She began immediately to determine , that Edward who lived with his mother , must be asked as his mother was , to a party given by his sister ; and to see him for the first time , after all that passed , in the company of Lucy!--she hardly knew how she could bear it ! These apprehensions , perhaps , were not founded entirely on reason , and certainly not at all on truth . They were relieved however , not by her own recollection , but by the good will of Lucy , who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday , and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself , which he could not conceal when they were together . The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother - in - law . \" Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood ! \" said Lucy , as they walked up the stairs together -- for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings , that they all followed the servant at the same time--\"There is nobody here but you , that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand . Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on -- that is to be my mother!\" -- Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton 's mother , rather than her own , whom they were about to behold ; but instead of doing that , she assured her , and with great sincerity , that she did pity her -- to the utter amazement of Lucy , who , though really uncomfortable herself , hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor . Mrs. Ferrars was a little , thin woman , upright , even to formality , in her figure , and serious , even to sourness , in her aspect . Her complexion was sallow ; and her features small , without beauty , and naturally without expression ; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity , by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature . She was not a woman of many words ; for , unlike people in general , she proportioned them to the number of her ideas ; and of the few syllables that did escape her , not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood , whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events . Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly ; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars ' power to distress her by it now;-- and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles , a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more , only amused her . She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for Lucy was particularly distinguished -- whom of all others , had they known as much as she did , they would have been most anxious to mortify ; while she herself , who had comparatively no power to wound them , sat pointedly slighted by both . But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean - spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four . Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished ; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy . The dinner was a grand one , the servants were numerous , and every thing bespoke the Mistress 's inclination for show , and the Master 's ability to support it . In spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the Norland estate , and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss , nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;-- no poverty of any kind , except of conversation , appeared-- but there , the deficiency was considerable . John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing , and his wife had still less . But there was no peculiar disgrace in this ; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors , who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable -- Want of sense , either natural or improved -- want of elegance -- want of spirits -- or want of temper . When the ladies withdrew to the drawing - room after dinner , this poverty was particularly evident , for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety -- the variety of politics , inclosing land , and breaking horses -- but then it was all over ; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in , which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood , and Lady Middleton 's second son William , who were nearly of the same age . Had both the children been there , the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once ; but as Harry only was present , it was all conjectural assertion on both sides ; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion , and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked . The parties stood thus : The two mothers , though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest , politely decided in favour of the other . The two grandmothers , with not less partiality , but more sincerity , were equally earnest in support of their own descendant . Lucy , who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other , thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age , and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them ; and Miss Steele , with yet greater address gave it , as fast as she could , in favour of each . Elinor , having once delivered her opinion on William 's side , by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more , did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion ; and Marianne , when called on for her 's , offended them all , by declaring that she had no opinion to give , as she had never thought about it . Before her removing from Norland , Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister - in - law , which being now just mounted and brought home , ornamented her present drawing room ; and these screens , catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room , were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration . \" These are done by my eldest sister , \" said he ; \" and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well . \" The Colonel , though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship , warmly admired the screens , as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood ; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited , they were handed round for general inspection . Mrs. Ferrars , not aware of their being Elinor 's work , particularly requested to look at them ; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons 's approbation , Fanny presented them to her mother , considerately informing her , at the same time , that they were done by Miss Dashwood . \" Hum\"--said Mrs. Ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without regarding them at all , returned them to her daughter . Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough,--for , colouring a little , she immediately said , \" They are very pretty , ma'am -- an't they ? \" But then again , the dread of having been too civil , too encouraging herself , probably came over her , for she presently added , \" Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton 's style of painting , Ma'am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done ! \" \" Beautifully indeed ! But SHE does every thing well . \" Marianne could not bear this.--She was already greatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars ; and such ill - timed praise of another , at Elinor 's expense , though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it , provoked her immediately to say with warmth , \" This is admiration of a very particular kind!-- what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows , or who cares , for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak . \" And so saying , she took the screens out of her sister - in - law 's hands , to admire them herself as they ought to be admired . Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry , and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever , pronounced in retort this bitter philippic , \" Miss Morton is Lord Morton 's daughter . \" Fanny looked very angry too , and her husband was all in a fright at his sister 's audacity . Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne 's warmth than she had been by what produced it ; but Colonel Brandon 's eyes , as they were fixed on Marianne , declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it , the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point . Marianne 's feelings did not stop here . The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars 's general behaviour to her sister , seemed , to her , to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor , as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror ; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility , she moved after a moment , to her sister 's chair , and putting one arm round her neck , and one cheek close to hers , said in a low , but eager , voice , \" Dear , dear Elinor , do n't mind them . Do n't let them make YOU unhappy . \" She could say no more ; her spirits were quite overcome , and hiding her face on Elinor 's shoulder , she burst into tears . Every body 's attention was called , and almost every body was concerned.--Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs . Jennings , with a very intelligent \" Ah ! poor dear , \" immediately gave her her salts ; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress , that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele , and gave her , in a whisper , a brief account of the whole shocking affair . In a few minutes , however , Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle , and sit down among the rest ; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed , the whole evening . \" Poor Marianne ! \" said her brother to Colonel Brandon , in a low voice , as soon as he could secure his attention,-- \" She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor 's constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . You would not think it perhaps , but Marianne WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as Elinor.-- Now you see it is all gone . \" 35 Elinor 's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of Edward and herself , had he been otherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars 's creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion . Or at least , if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward 's being fettered to Lucy , she determined , that had Lucy been more amiable , she OUGHT to have rejoiced . She wondered that Lucy 's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown . But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy 's eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was . The chance proved a lucky one , for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived , carried Mrs. Jennings away . \" My dear friend , \" cried Lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , \" I come to talk to you of my happiness . Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars 's way of treating me yesterday ? So exceeding affable as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;-- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . Now was not it so?-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? \" \" She was certainly very civil to you . \" \" Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal more . Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same -- all sweetness and affability ! \" Elinor wished to talk of something else , but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness ; and Elinor was obliged to go on.-- \" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , \" said she , \" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was not the case\"-- \" I guessed you would say so\"--replied Lucy quickly--\"but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . You sha n't talk me out of my satisfaction . I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think . Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . They are both delightful women , indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! \" To this Elinor had no answer to make , and did not attempt any . \" Are you ill , Miss Dashwood?--you seem low -- you do n't speak;--sure you an't well . \" \" I never was in better health . \" \" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it . I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . \" -- Elinor tried to make a civil answer , though doubting her own success . But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , \" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.-- They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high . \" But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister . Lucy continued . \" I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me . If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . I could not have stood it . For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . \" Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door 's being thrown open , the servant 's announcing Mr. Ferrars , and Edward 's immediately walking in . It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so . They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it . The very circumstance , in its unpleasantest form , which they would each have been most anxious to avoid , had fallen on them.--They were not only all three together , but were together without the relief of any other person . The ladies recovered themselves first . It was not Lucy 's business to put herself forward , and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up . She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness , and after slightly addressing him , said no more . But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment 's recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them . She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street . She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her . Her manners gave some re - assurance to Edward , and he had courage enough to sit down ; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion , which the case rendered reasonable , though his sex might make it rare ; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy 's , nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor 's . Lucy , with a demure and settled air , seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others , and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that WAS said , proceeded from Elinor , who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother 's health , their coming to town , & c. which Edward ought to have inquired about , but never did . Her exertions did not stop here ; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine , under pretence of fetching Marianne , to leave the others by themselves ; and she really did it , and THAT in the handsomest manner , for she loitered away several minutes on the landing - place , with the most high - minded fortitude , before she went to her sister . When that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease ; for Marianne 's joy hurried her into the drawing - room immediately . Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings , strong in itself , and strongly spoken . She met him with a hand that would be taken , and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister . \" Dear Edward ! \" she cried , \" this is a moment of great happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing ? \" Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt . Again they all sat down , and for a moment or two all were silent ; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness , sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor , regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy 's unwelcome presence . Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne 's altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her . \" Oh , do n't think of me ! \" she replied with spirited earnestness , though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke , \" do n't think of MY health . Elinor is well , you see . That must be enough for us both . \" This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy , nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy , who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression . \" Do you like London ? \" said Edward , willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject . \" Not at all . I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none . The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven ! you are what you always were ! \" She paused -- no one spoke . \" I think , Elinor , \" she presently added , \" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton . In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . \" Poor Edward muttered something , but what it was , nobody knew , not even himself . But Marianne , who saw his agitation , and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself , was perfectly satisfied , and soon talked of something else . \" We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday ! So dull , so wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . \" And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever , and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother , till they were more in private . \" But why were you not there , Edward?--Why did you not come ? \" \" I was engaged elsewhere . \" \" Engaged ! But what was that , when such friends were to be met ? \" \" Perhaps , Miss Marianne , \" cried Lucy , eager to take some revenge on her , \" you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great . \" Elinor was very angry , but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting ; for she calmly replied , \" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation . \" The nature of her commendation , in the present case , however , happened to be particularly ill - suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors , and was so very unexhilarating to Edward , that he very soon got up to go away . \" Going so soon ! \" said Marianne ; \" my dear Edward , this must not be . \" And drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer . But even this encouragement failed , for he would go ; and Lucy , who would have outstaid him , had his visit lasted two hours , soon afterwards went away . \" What can bring her here so often ? \" said Marianne , on her leaving them . \" Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward ! \" \" Why so?--we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any . It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . \" Marianne looked at her steadily , and said , \" You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . \" She then left the room ; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more , for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy , she could give no information that would convince Marianne ; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be , she was obliged to submit to it . All that she could hope , was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne 's mistaken warmth , nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting -- and this she had every reason to expect .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 4], "text": "Mrs. John Dashwood"}, {"position": [9, 10], "text": "her"},
