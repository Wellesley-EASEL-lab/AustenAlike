{"document": "44 Elinor , starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him , obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room , and her hand was already on the lock , when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing , and saying , in a voice rather of command than supplication , \" Miss Dashwood , for half an hour -- for ten minutes-- I entreat you to stay . \" \" No , sir , \" she replied with firmness , \" I shall NOT stay . Your business can not be with ME . The servants , I suppose , forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house . \" \" Had they told me , \" he cried with vehemence , \" that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door . My business is with you , and only you . \" \" With me!\" --in the utmost amazement--\"well , sir,-- be quick -- and if you can -- less violent . \" \" Sit down , and I will be both . \" She hesitated ; she knew not what to do . The possibility of Colonel Brandon 's arriving and finding her there , came across her . But she had promised to hear him , and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged . After a moment 's recollection , therefore , concluding that prudence required dispatch , and that her acquiescence would best promote it , she walked silently towards the table , and sat down . He took the opposite chair , and for half a minute not a word was said by either . \" Pray be quick , sir,\"--said Elinor , impatiently;-- \" I have no time to spare . \" He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation , and seemed not to hear her . \" Your sister , \" said he , with abruptness , a moment afterwards--\"is out of danger . I heard it from the servant . God be praised!--But is it true ? is it really true ? \" Elinor would not speak . He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness . \" For God 's sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ? \" \" We hope she is . \" He rose up , and walked across the room . \" Had I known as much half an hour ago -- But since I AM here,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat--\"what does it signify?--For once , Miss Dashwood -- it will be the last time , perhaps -- let us be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.-- Tell me honestly\"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks-- \" do you think me most a knave or a fool ? \" Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever . She began to think that be must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit , and of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this impression she immediately rose , saying , \" Mr. Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe -- I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.-- Whatever your business may be with me , will it be better recollected and explained to - morrow . \" \" I understand you , \" he replied , with an expressive smile , and a voice perfectly calm ; \" yes , I am very drunk.-- A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over - set me . \" \" At Marlborough!\" --cried Elinor , more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at . \" Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock , and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough . \" The steadiness of his manner , and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke , convincing Elinor , that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland , he was not brought there by intoxication , she said , after a moment 's recollection , \" Mr. Willoughby , you OUGHT to feel , and I certainly DO -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse.--What is it , that you mean by it?\" -- \" I mean,\"--said he , with serious energy--\"if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW . I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma -- from your sister . \" \" Is this the real reason of your coming ? \" \" Upon my soul it is,\"--was his answer , with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance , and in spite of herself made her think him sincere . \" If that is all , you may be satisfied already,-- for Marianne DOES -- she has LONG forgiven you . \" \" Has she?\" --he cried , in the same eager tone.-- \" Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it . But she shall forgive me again , and on more reasonable grounds.--NOW will you listen to me ? \" Elinor bowed her assent . \" I do not know , \" said he , after a pause of expectation on her side , and thoughtfulness on his own,--\"how YOU may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister , or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is worth the trial however , and you shall hear every thing . When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before . Your sister 's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind -- It is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what SHE was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . \" Miss Dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying , \" It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject . \" \" I insist on you hearing the whole of it , \" he replied , \" My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . Every year since my coming of age , or even before , I believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , Mrs. Smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re - establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty-- which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much -- I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love . But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice?--or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers?-- But I have done it . To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing . \" \" You did then , \" said Elinor , a little softened , \" believe yourself at one time attached to her ? \" \" To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have done it?--Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless . Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed . I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound . The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever . At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display . But in the interim -- in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private-- a circumstance occurred -- an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort . A discovery took place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down.--\"Mrs . Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain myself farther , \" he added , looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye--\"your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago . \" \" I have , \" returned Elinor , colouring likewise , and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him , \" I have heard it all . And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business , I confess is beyond my comprehension . \" \" Remember , \" cried Willoughby , \" from whom you received the account . Could it be an impartial one ? I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me . I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint . If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding -- I do not mean , however , to defend myself . Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self - reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . I wish -- I heartily wish it had never been . But I have injured more than herself ; and I have injured one , whose affection for me--(may I say it ? ) was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind -- Oh ! how infinitely superior!\" -- \" Your indifference , however , towards that unfortunate girl -- I must say it , unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be -- your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her . Do not think yourself excused by any weakness , any natural defect of understanding on her side , in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours . You must have known , that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes , always gay , always happy , she was reduced to the extremest indigence . \" \" But , upon my soul , I did NOT know it , \" he warmly replied ; \" I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction ; and common sense might have told her how to find it out . \" \" Well , sir , and what said Mrs. Smith ? \" \" She taxed me with the offence at once , and my confusion may be guessed . The purity of her life , the formality of her notions , her ignorance of the world -- every thing was against me . The matter itself I could not deny , and vain was every endeavour to soften it . She was previously disposed , I believe , to doubt the morality of my conduct in general , and was moreover discontented with the very little attention , the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her , in my present visit . In short , it ended in a total breach . By one measure I might have saved myself . In the height of her morality , good woman ! she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza . That could not be -- and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house . The night following this affair -- I was to go the next morning-- was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be . The struggle was great -- but it ended too soon . My affection for Marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me -- it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which I was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased . I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement . But whether I should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate . To see Marianne , I felt , would be dreadful , and I even doubted whether I could see her again , and keep to my resolution . In that point , however , I undervalued my own magnanimity , as the event declared ; for I went , I saw her , and saw her miserable , and left her miserable -- and left her hoping never to see her again . \" \" Why did you call , Mr. Willoughby ? \" said Elinor , reproachfully ; \" a note would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call ? \" \" It was necessary to my own pride . I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you , or the rest of the neighbourhood , to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself-- and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage , in my way to Honiton . The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone . You were all gone I do not know where . I had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right ! A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and I remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as I walked from the cottage to Allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body ! But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . Her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately -- I never shall forget it -- united too with such reliance , such confidence in me!--Oh , God!--what a hard - hearted rascal I was ! \" They were both silent for a few moments . Elinor first spoke . \" Did you tell her that you should soon return ? \" \" I do not know what I told her , \" he replied , impatiently ; \" less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future . I can not think of it.--It wo n't do.--Then came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence . Thank Heaven ! it DID torture me . I was miserable . Miss Dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery . I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now . Well , I went , left all that I loved , and went to those to whom , at best , I was only indifferent . My journey to town -- travelling with my own horses , and therefore so tediously -- no creature to speak to -- my own reflections so cheerful -- when I looked forward every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton , the picture so soothing!--oh , it was a blessed journey ! \" He stopped . \" Well , sir , \" said Elinor , who , though pitying him , grew impatient for his departure , \" and this is all ? \" \" Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?-- That infamous letter -- Did she shew it you ? \" \" Yes , I saw every note that passed . \" \" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time , ) what I felt is-- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion-- my feelings were very , very painful.--Every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart . To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language-- a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure they are dearer . \" Elinor 's heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last . \" This is not right , Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are married . Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear . \" \" Marianne 's note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . '-- But this note made me know myself better . I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously . But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me . To retreat was impossible . All that I had to do , was to avoid you both . I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;--but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name . \" \" Watched us out of the house ! \" \" Even so . You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you , how often I was on the point of falling in with you . I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by . Lodging as I did in Bond Street , there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long . I avoided the Middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings 's . He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him . The next morning brought another short note from Marianne-- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make MY conduct most hateful . I could not answer it . I tried -- but could not frame a sentence . But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day . If you CAN pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was THEN . With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse than all . Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!-- Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh , God!--holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- Well , it does not signify ; it is over now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne 's sweet face as white as death.--THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her;-- the last manner in which she appeared to me . It was a horrid sight!--yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world . She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue . \" A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded . Willoughby first rousing himself , broke it thus : \" Well , let me make haste and be gone . Your sister is certainly better , certainly out of danger ? \" \" We are assured of it . \" \" Your poor mother , too!--doting on Marianne . \" \" But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ? \" \" Yes , yes , THAT in particular . Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . You saw what she said . I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings . It happened to catch Sophia 's eye before it caught mine -- and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand - writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion . Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever . Affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents . She was well paid for her impudence . She read what made her wretched . Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion -- her malice -- At all events it must be appeased . And , in short -- what do you think of my wife 's style of letter - writing?--delicate -- tender-- truly feminine -- was it not ? \" \" Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand - writing . \" \" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to . The original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . But what could I do!--we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed -- But I am talking like a fool . Preparation!--day!--In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture . And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end . My business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.-- ' I am ruined for ever in their opinion-- ' said I to myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one . ' Such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , I copied my wife 's words , and parted with the last relics of Marianne . Her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever -- I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them . And the lock of hair -- that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket - book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock -- all , every memento was torn from me . \" \" You are very wrong , Mr. Willoughby , very blamable , \" said Elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; \" you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister . You had made your own choice . It was not forced on you . Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you . To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne -- nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience . \" \" Do not talk to me of my wife , \" said he with a heavy sigh.-- \" She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no regard for her when we married.--Well , married we were , and came down to Combe Magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me , Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?-- Am I -- be it only one degree -- am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong . Have I explained away any part of my guilt ? \" \" Yes , you have certainly removed something -- a little.-- You have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than I had believed you . You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked . But I hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- I hardly know what could have made it worse . \" \" Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . You tell me that she has forgiven me already . Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness . Tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever . \" \" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . \" \" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy . What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments -- for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ? ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made , and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage . Now you know all . \" Elinor made no answer . Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper . The world had made him extravagant and vain -- Extravagance and vanity had made him cold - hearted and selfish . Vanity , while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another , had involved him in a real attachment , which extravagance , or at least its offspring , necessity , had required to be sacrificed . Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil , had led him likewise to punishment . The attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said-- \" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . \" \" Are you going back to town ? \" \" No -- to Combe Magna . I have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two . Good bye . \" He held out his hand . She could not refuse to give him hers's;--he pressed it with affection . \" And you DO think something better of me than you did?\" --said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel - piece as if forgetting he was to go . Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave , pitied , wished him well -- was even interested in his happiness -- and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it . His answer was not very encouraging . \" As to that , \" said he , \" I must rub through the world as well as I can . Domestic happiness is out of the question . If , however , I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions , it may be the means -- it may put me on my guard -- at least , it may be something to live for . Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever . Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again-- \" Elinor stopped him with a reproof . \" Well,\"--he replied--\"once more good bye . I shall now go away and live in dread of one event . \" \" What do you mean ? \" \" Your sister 's marriage . \" \" You are very wrong . She can never be more lost to you than she is now . \" \" But she will be gained by some one else . And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive . Good bye,--God bless you ! \" And with these words , he almost ran out of the room . 45 Elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister . Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits . She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge . But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less . When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes . Elinor 's heart was full . The past , the present , the future , Willoughby 's visit , Marianne 's safety , and her mother 's expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby 's leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment 's horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it . Mrs. Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne 's being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but SHE , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief;-- and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears . She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . Elinor 's delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;-- but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , in compliance with her mother 's entreaty , went to bed . But the rest , which one night entirely sleepless , and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite , was kept off by irritation of spirits . Willoughby , \" poor Willoughby , \" as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful . She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby 's death . The shock of Colonel Brandon 's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection . Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood 's looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward . But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor . It was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred . \" At last we are alone . My Elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness . Colonel Brandon loves Marianne . He has told me so himself . \" Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention . \" You are never like me , dear Elinor , or I should wonder at your composure now . Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon 's marrying one of you as the object most desirable . And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . \" Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given;--but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . \" He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled . It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly . I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne . He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her . \" Here , however , Elinor perceived,--not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother 's active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose . \" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm , as more sincere or constant -- which ever we are to call it-- has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne 's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and without selfishness -- without encouraging a hope!--could he have seen her happy with another -- Such a noble mind!-- such openness , such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM . \" \" Colonel Brandon 's character , \" said Elinor , \" as an excellent man , is well established . \" \" I know it is\"--replied her mother seriously , \" or after such a warning , I should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men . \" \" His character , however , \" answered Elinor , \" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him . To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? \" \" Oh ! my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself . Marianne might at that moment be dying . But he did not ask for hope or encouragement . His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend -- not an application to a parent . Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power . Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;--Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it . \" \" To judge from the Colonel 's spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine . \" \" No.--He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed;--and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like . \" Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued , \" And his manners , the Colonel 's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby 's ever were , but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne . Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . \" She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence . \" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , \" added Mrs. Dashwood , \" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation . \" Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn . \" His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one . \" Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person , and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private , to wish success to her friend , and yet in wishing it , to feel a pang for Willoughby .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text":
