{"document": "18 Elinor saw , with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend . His visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction , while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect . It was evident that he was unhappy ; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring ; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain ; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one . He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast - room the next morning before the others were down ; and Marianne , who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could , soon left them to themselves . But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open , and , turning round , was astonished to see Edward himself come out . \" I am going into the village to see my horses , \" said be , \" as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently . \" * * * Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country ; in his walk to the village , he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage ; and the village itself , in a much higher situation than the cottage , afforded a general view of the whole , which had exceedingly pleased him . This was a subject which ensured Marianne 's attention , and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes , and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him , when Edward interrupted her by saying , \" You must not enquire too far , Marianne -- remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility -- and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque . \" \" I am afraid it is but too true , \" said Marianne ; \" but why should you boast of it ? \" \" I suspect , \" said Elinor , \" that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . \" \" It is very true , \" said Marianne , \" that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning . \" \" I am convinced , \" said Edward , \" that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess . I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower -- and a troop of tidy , happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world . \" Marianne looked with amazement at Edward , with compassion at her sister . Elinor only laughed . The subject was continued no farther ; and Marianne remained thoughtfully silent , till a new object suddenly engaged her attention . She was sitting by Edward , and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood , his hand passed so directly before her , as to make a ring , with a plait of hair in the centre , very conspicuous on one of his fingers . \" I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward , \" she cried . \" Is that Fanny 's hair ? I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker . \" Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt-- but when she saw how much she had pained Edward , her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his . He coloured very deeply , and giving a momentary glance at Elinor , replied , \" Yes ; it is my sister 's hair . The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . \" Elinor had met his eye , and looked conscious likewise . That the hair was her own , she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne ; the only difference in their conclusions was , that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister , Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself . She was not in a humour , however , to regard it as an affront , and affecting to take no notice of what passed , by instantly talking of something else , she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself , beyond all doubt , that it was exactly the shade of her own . Edward 's embarrassment lasted some time , and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled . He was particularly grave the whole morning . Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said ; but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy , had she known how little offence it had given her sister . Before the middle of the day , they were visited by Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , who , having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage , came to take a survey of the guest . With the assistance of his mother - in - law , Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted Elinor , which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung . But , as it was , she only learned , from some very significant looks , how far their penetration , founded on Margaret 's instructions , extended . Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day , or to drink tea with them that evening . On the present occasion , for the better entertainment of their visitor , towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute , he wished to engage them for both . \" You MUST drink tea with us to night , \" said he , \" for we shall be quite alone -- and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . \" Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity . \" And who knows but you may raise a dance , \" said she . \" And that will tempt YOU , Miss Marianne . \" \" A dance ! \" cried Marianne . \" Impossible ! Who is to dance ? \" \" Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure.--What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! \" \" I wish with all my soul , \" cried Sir John , \" that Willoughby were among us again . \" This , and Marianne 's blushing , gave new suspicions to Edward . \" And who is Willoughby ? \" said he , in a low voice , to Miss Dashwood , by whom he was sitting . She gave him a brief reply . Marianne 's countenance was more communicative . Edward saw enough to comprehend , not only the meaning of others , but such of Marianne 's expressions as had puzzled him before ; and when their visitors left them , he went immediately round her , and said , in a whisper , \" I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ? \" \" What do you mean ? \" \" Shall I tell you . \" \" Certainly . \" \" Well then ; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts . \" Marianne was surprised and confused , yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner , and after a moment 's silence , said , \" Oh , Edward ! How can you?--But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him . \" \" I do not doubt it , \" replied he , rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth ; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general , founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby and herself , he would not have ventured to mention it . 19 Edward remained a week at the cottage ; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer ; but , as if he were bent only on self - mortification , he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height . His spirits , during the last two or three days , though still very unequal , were greatly improved -- he grew more and more partial to the house and environs -- never spoke of going away without a sigh -- declared his time to be wholly disengaged -- even doubted to what place he should go when he left them -- but still , go he must . Never had any week passed so quickly -- he could hardly believe it to be gone . He said so repeatedly ; other things he said too , which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions . He had no pleasure at Norland ; he detested being in town ; but either to Norland or London , he must go . He valued their kindness beyond any thing , and his greatest happiness was in being with them . Yet , he must leave them at the end of a week , in spite of their wishes and his own , and without any restraint on his time . Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother 's account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son . Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby 's service , by her mother . His want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars 's disposition and designs . The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother . The old well - established grievance of duty against will , parent against child , was the cause of all . She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease , this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed , and her son be at liberty to be happy . But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward 's affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger . \" I think , Edward , \" said Mrs. Dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , \" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it -- you would not be able to give them so much of your time . But ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least -- you would know where to go when you left them . \" \" I do assure you , \" he replied , \" that I have long thought on this point , as you think now . It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do . But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing . I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since . \" \" The consequence of which , I suppose , will be , \" said Mrs. Dashwood , \" since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella 's . \" \" They will be brought up , \" said he , in a serious accent , \" to be as unlike myself as is possible . In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing . \" \" Come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , Edward . You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy . But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . Know your own happiness . You want nothing but patience -- or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . How much may not a few months do ? \" \" I think , \" replied Edward , \" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . \" This desponding turn of mind , though it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood , gave additional pain to them all in the parting , which shortly took place , and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor 's feelings especially , which required some trouble and time to subdue . But as it was her determination to subdue it , and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away , she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne , on a similar occasion , to augment and fix her sorrow , by seeking silence , solitude and idleness . Their means were as different as their objects , and equally suited to the advancement of each . Elinor sat down to her drawing - table as soon as he was out of the house , busily employed herself the whole day , neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name , appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family , and if , by this conduct , she did not lessen her own grief , it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase , and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account . Such behaviour as this , so exactly the reverse of her own , appeared no more meritorious to Marianne , than her own had seemed faulty to her . The business of self - command she settled very easily;--with strong affections it was impossible , with calm ones it could have no merit . That her sister 's affections WERE calm , she dared not deny , though she blushed to acknowledge it ; and of the strength of her own , she gave a very striking proof , by still loving and respecting that sister , in spite of this mortifying conviction . Without shutting herself up from her family , or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them , or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation , Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward , and of Edward 's behaviour , in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,--with tenderness , pity , approbation , censure , and doubt . There were moments in abundance , when , if not by the absence of her mother and sisters , at least by the nature of their employments , conversation was forbidden among them , and every effect of solitude was produced . Her mind was inevitably at liberty ; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere ; and the past and the future , on a subject so interesting , must be before her , must force her attention , and engross her memory , her reflection , and her fancy . From a reverie of this kind , as she sat at her drawing - table , she was roused one morning , soon after Edward 's leaving them , by the arrival of company . She happened to be quite alone . The closing of the little gate , at the entrance of the green court in front of the house , drew her eyes to the window , and she saw a large party walking up to the door . Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings , but there were two others , a gentleman and lady , who were quite unknown to her . She was sitting near the window , and as soon as Sir John perceived her , he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door , and stepping across the turf , obliged her to open the casement to speak to him , though the space was so short between the door and the window , as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other . \" Well , \" said he , \" we have brought you some strangers . How do you like them ? \" \" Hush ! they will hear you . \" \" Never mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way . \" As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes , without taking that liberty , she begged to be excused . \" Where is Marianne ? Has she run away because we are come ? I see her instrument is open . \" \" She is walking , I believe . \" They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings , who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told HER story . She came hallooing to the window , \" How do you do , my dear ? How does Mrs. Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What ! all alone ! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you . I have brought my other son and daughter to see you . Only think of their coming so suddenly ! I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again\"-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John . Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton , and totally unlike her in every respect . She was short and plump , had a very pretty face , and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be . Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister 's , but they were much more prepossessing . She came in with a smile , smiled all the time of her visit , except when she laughed , and smiled when she went away . Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty , with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife , but of less willingness to please or be pleased . He entered the room with a look of self - consequence , slightly bowed to the ladies , without speaking a word , and , after briefly surveying them and their apartments , took up a newspaper from the table , and continued to read it as long as he staid . Mrs. Palmer , on the contrary , who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy , was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth . \" Well ! what a delightful room this is ! I never saw anything so charming ! Only think , Mamma , how it is improved since I was here last ! I always thought it such a sweet place , ma'am ! ( turning to Mrs. Dashwood ) but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is ! How I should like such a house for myself ! Should not you , Mr. Palmer ? \" Mr. Palmer made her no answer , and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper . \" Mr. Palmer does not hear me , \" said she , laughing ; \" he never does sometimes . It is so ridiculous ! \" This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood ; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one , and could not help looking with surprise at them both . Mrs. Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told . Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment , and every body agreed , two or three times over , that it had been quite an agreeable surprise . \" You may believe how glad we all were to see them , \" added Mrs. Jennings , leaning forward towards Elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; \" but , however , I ca n't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! \" Mrs. Palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm . \" She expects to be confined in February , \" continued Mrs. Jennings . Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper . \" No , none at all , \" he replied , and read on . \" Here comes Marianne , \" cried Sir John . \" Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl . \" He immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself . Mrs. Jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to Allenham ; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it . Mr. Palmer looked up on her entering the room , stared at her some minutes , and then returned to his newspaper . Mrs. Palmer 's eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room . She got up to examine them . \" Oh ! dear , how beautiful these are ! Well ! how delightful ! Do but look , mama , how sweet ! I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever . \" And then sitting down again , she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room . When Lady Middleton rose to go away , Mr. Palmer rose also , laid down the newspaper , stretched himself and looked at them all around . \" My love , have you been asleep ? \" said his wife , laughing . He made her no answer ; and only observed , after again examining the room , that it was very low pitched , and that the ceiling was crooked . He then made his bow , and departed with the rest . Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park . Mrs. Dashwood , who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage , absolutely refused on her own account ; her daughters might do as they pleased . But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner , and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way . They attempted , therefore , likewise , to excuse themselves ; the weather was uncertain , and not likely to be good . But Sir John would not be satisfied -- the carriage should be sent for them and they must come . Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them . Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties , all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party ; and the young ladies were obliged to yield . \" Why should they ask us ? \" said Marianne , as soon as they were gone . \" The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us . \" \" They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , \" said Elinor , \" by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . We must look for the change elsewhere . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [11, 12], "text": "her"}, {"position": [17, 18], "text": "her"},
