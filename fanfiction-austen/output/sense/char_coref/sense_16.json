{"document": "32 When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister , as they very soon were , the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see . Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it , for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention , made neither objection nor remark , attempted no vindication of Willoughby , and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible . But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind , though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it , in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called , in her speaking to him , even voluntarily speaking , with a kind of compassionate respect , and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before , she did not see her less wretched . Her mind did become settled , but it was settled in a gloomy dejection . She felt the loss of Willoughby 's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart ; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams , the misery of that poor girl , and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself , preyed altogether so much on her spirits , that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor ; and , brooding over her sorrows in silence , gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them . To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor 's letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said ; of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne 's , and an indignation even greater than Elinor 's . Long letters from her , quickly succeeding each other , arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought ; to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne , and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune . Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne 's affliction be , when her mother could talk of fortitude ! mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets , which SHE could wish her not to indulge ! Against the interest of her own individual comfort , Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where , at that time , than at Barton , where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner , by constantly placing Willoughby before her , such as she had always seen him there . She recommended it to her daughters , therefore , by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings ; the length of which , though never exactly fixed , had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks . A variety of occupations , of objects , and of company , which could not be procured at Barton , would be inevitable there , and might yet , she hoped , cheat Marianne , at times , into some interest beyond herself , and even into some amusement , much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her . From all danger of seeing Willoughby again , her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country , since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends . Design could never bring them in each other 's way : negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise ; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton , where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage , which Mrs. Dashwood , from foreseeing at first as a probable event , had brought herself to expect as a certain one . She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son - in - law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother . Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother 's opinion , and she submitted to it therefore without opposition , though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected , though she felt it to be entirely wrong , formed on mistaken grounds , and that by requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness , the personal sympathy of her mother , and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment 's rest . But it was a matter of great consolation to her , that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister ; and Elinor , on the other hand , suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely , comforted herself by thinking , that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness , it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire . Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby 's name mentioned , was not thrown away . Marianne , though without knowing it herself , reaped all its advantage ; for neither Mrs. Jennings , nor Sir John , nor even Mrs. Palmer herself , ever spoke of him before her . Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself , but that was impossible , and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all . Sir John , could not have thought it possible . \" A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly 's puppies ! and this was the end of it ! \" Mrs. Palmer , in her way , was equally angry . \" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . \" The rest of Mrs. Palmer 's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage , and communicating them to Elinor . She could soon tell at what coachmaker 's the new carriage was building , by what painter Mr. Willoughby 's portrait was drawn , and at what warehouse Miss Grey 's clothes might be seen . The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor 's spirits , oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others . It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle of friends : a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars , or any anxiety for her sister 's health . Every qualification is raised at times , by the circumstances of the moment , to more than its real value ; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good - breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good - nature . Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day , or twice , if the subject occurred very often , by saying , \" It is very shocking , indeed ! \" and by the means of this continual though gentle vent , was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion , but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter ; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex , and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other , she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies , and therefore determined ( though rather against the opinion of Sir John ) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune , to leave her card with her as soon as she married . Colonel Brandon 's delicate , unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood . He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister 's disappointment , by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it , and they always conversed with confidence . His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations , was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him , and the gentleness of her voice whenever ( though it did not often happen ) she was obliged , or could oblige herself to speak to him . THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good - will towards himself , and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter ; but Mrs. Jennings , who knew nothing of all this , who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever , and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself , nor commission her to make it for him , began , at the end of two days , to think that , instead of Midsummer , they would not be married till Michaelmas , and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all . The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry - tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to HER ; and Mrs. Jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars . Early in February , within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby 's letter , Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married . She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself , as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over , as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers , which she saw her eagerly examining every morning . She received the news with resolute composure ; made no observation on it , and at first shed no tears ; but after a short time they would burst out , and for the rest of the day , she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event . The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married ; and Elinor now hoped , as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them , to prevail on her sister , who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell , to go out again by degrees as she had done before . About this time the two Miss Steeles , lately arrived at their cousin 's house in Bartlett 's Buildings , Holburn , presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets ; and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality . Elinor only was sorry to see them . Their presence always gave her pain , and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town . \" I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL , \" said she repeatedly , with a strong emphasis on the word . \" But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD . \" Elinor perfectly understood her , and was forced to use all her self - command to make it appear that she did NOT . \" Well , my dear , \" said Mrs. Jennings , \" and how did you travel ? \" \" Not in the stage , I assure you , \" replied Miss Steele , with quick exultation ; \" we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr. Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we 'd join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . \" \" Oh , oh ! \" cried Mrs. Jennings ; \" very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you . \" \" There now , \" said Miss Steele , affectedly simpering , \" everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I can not think why . My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour 's end to another . ' Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy , ' my cousin said t'other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I -- I can not think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine . \" \" Aye , aye , that is very pretty talking -- but it wo n't do-- the Doctor is the man , I see . \" \" No , indeed ! \" replied her cousin , with affected earnestness , \" and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . \" Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she certainly would NOT , and Miss Steele was made completely happy . \" I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , \" said Lucy , returning , after a cessation of hostile hints , to the charge . \" No , I do not think we shall . \" \" Oh , yes , I dare say you will . \" Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition . \" What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! \" \" Long a time , indeed ! \" interposed Mrs. Jennings . \" Why , their visit is but just begun ! \" Lucy was silenced . \" I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , \" said Miss Steele . \" I am sorry she is not well-- \" for Marianne had left the room on their arrival . \" You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . \" \" Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word . \" Elinor , with great civility , declined the proposal . Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed , or in her dressing gown , and therefore not able to come to them . \" Oh , if that 's all , \" cried Miss Steele , \" we can just as well go and see HER . \" Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper ; but she was saved the trouble of checking it , by Lucy 's sharp reprimand , which now , as on many occasions , though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister , was of advantage in governing those of the other . 33 After some opposition , Marianne yielded to her sister 's entreaties , and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour . She expressly conditioned , however , for paying no visits , and would do no more than accompany them to Gray 's in Sackville Street , where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old - fashioned jewels of her mother . When they stopped at the door , Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call ; and as she had no business at Gray 's , it was resolved , that while her young friends transacted their 's , she should pay her visit and return for them . On ascending the stairs , the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before them in the room , that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders ; and they were obliged to wait . All that could be done was , to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession ; one gentleman only was standing there , and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch . But the correctness of his eye , and the delicacy of his taste , proved to be beyond his politeness . He was giving orders for a toothpick - case for himself , and till its size , shape , and ornaments were determined , all of which , after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick - case in the shop , were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy , he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies , than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares ; a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face , of strong , natural , sterling insignificance , though adorned in the first style of fashion . Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment , on this impertinent examination of their features , and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick - cases presented to his inspection , by remaining unconscious of it all ; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself , and be as ignorant of what was passing around her , in Mr. Gray 's shop , as in her own bedroom . At last the affair was decided . The ivory , the gold , and the pearls , all received their appointment , and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick - case , drew on his gloves with leisurely care , and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods , but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration , walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference . Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward , was on the point of concluding it , when another gentleman presented himself at her side . She turned her eyes towards his face , and found him with some surprise to be her brother . Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray 's shop . John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again ; it rather gave them satisfaction ; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive . Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days . \" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday , \" said he , \" but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars . Harry was vastly pleased . THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal . But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings . I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to THEM . As my mother - in - law 's relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand . \" \" Excellent indeed . Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . \" \" I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . \" Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother ; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him , by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings 's servant , who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door . Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs , was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage , and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day , took leave . His visit was duly paid . He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister - in - law , for not coming too ; \" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . \" Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton . The weather was remarkably fine , and she readily consented . As soon as they were out of the house , his enquiries began . \" Who is Colonel Brandon ? Is he a man of fortune ? \" \" Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . \" \" I am glad of it . He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . \" \" Me , brother ! what do you mean ? \" \" He likes you . I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . What is the amount of his fortune ? \" \" I believe about two thousand a year . \" \" Two thousand a - year ; \" and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity , he added , \" Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much , for your sake . \" \" Indeed I believe you , \" replied Elinor ; \" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME . \" \" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side -- in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable-- you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family . It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that\"--lowering his voice to an important whisper--\"will be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES . \" Recollecting himself , however , he added , \" That is , I mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you . And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . \" Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer . \" It would be something remarkable , now , \" he continued , \" something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . \" \" Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , \" said Elinor , with resolution , \" going to be married ? \" \" It is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . He has a most excellent mother . Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds . A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time . A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit . To give you another instance of her liberality:--The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny 's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . And extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here . \" He paused for her assent and compassion ; and she forced herself to say , \" Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . \" \" Not so large , I dare say , as many people suppose . I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live . The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it . I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . A man must pay for his convenience ; and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money . \" \" More than you think it really and intrinsically worth . \" \" Why , I hope not that . I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker 's hands , I must have sold out to very great loss . \" Elinor could only smile . \" Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away . You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars 's kindness is . \" \" Certainly , \" said Elinor ; \" and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances . \" \" Another year or two may do much towards it , \" he gravely replied ; \" but however there is still a great deal to be done . There is not a stone laid of Fanny 's green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out . \" \" Where is the green - house to be ? \" \" Upon the knoll behind the house . The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . \" Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself ; and was very thankful that Marianne was not present , to share the provocation . Having now said enough to make his poverty clear , and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear - rings for each of his sisters , in his next visit at Gray 's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn , and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings . \" She seems a most valuable woman indeed -- Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.-- She must have a great deal to leave . \" \" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . \" \" But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . Few people of common prudence will do THAT ; and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . \" \" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? \" \" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard . Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises . \" \" But she raises none in those most concerned . Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far . \" \" Why , to be sure , \" said he , seeming to recollect himself , \" people have little , have very little in their power . But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin . Is she ill ? \" \" She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks . \" \" I am sorry for that . At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever ! Her 's has been a very short one ! She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better . Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . \" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect . They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home , and Sir John came in before their visit ended . Abundance of civilities passed on all sides . Sir John was ready to like anybody , and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses , he soon set him down as a very good - natured fellow : while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having ; and Mr. Dashwood went away delighted with both . \" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , \" said he , as he walked back with his sister . \" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [10, 12], "text": "Miss Dashwood"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "her"}, {"position": [13,
