{"document": "[ Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811 ] 1 The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex . Their estate was large , and their residence was at Norland Park , in the centre of their property , where , for many generations , they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance . The late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister . But her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood , the legal inheritor of the Norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it . In the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old Gentleman 's days were comfortably spent . His attachment to them all increased . The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence . By a former marriage , Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters . The son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age . By his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth . To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father 's inheriting that property , could be but small . Their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife 's fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life - interest in it . The old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure . He was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest . Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son , and his son 's son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods . The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters . He meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a - piece . Mr. Dashwood 's disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement . But the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth . He survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters . His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother - in - law and sisters . Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable . His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them . He was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . Had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife . But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;-- more narrow - minded and selfish . When he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a - piece . He then really thought himself equal to it . The prospect of four thousand a - year , in addition to his present income , besides the remaining half of his own mother 's fortune , warmed his heart , and made him feel capable of generosity.-- \" Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! It would be enough to make them completely easy . Three thousand pounds ! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . \" -- He thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent . No sooner was his father 's funeral over , than Mrs. John Dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants . No one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband 's from the moment of his father 's decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood 's situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing;-- but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immoveable disgust . Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband 's family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it . So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter - in - law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother . Elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence . She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught . Marianne 's abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to Elinor 's . She was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation . She was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent . The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great . Elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister 's sensibility ; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished . They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction . The agony of grief which overpowered them at first , was voluntarily renewed , was sought for , was created again and again . They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow , seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it , and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future . Elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself . She could consult with her brother , could receive her sister - in - law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance . Margaret , the other sister , was a good - humored , well - disposed girl ; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne 's romance , without having much of her sense , she did not , at thirteen , bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [10, 14], "text": "The family of Dashwood"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text":
