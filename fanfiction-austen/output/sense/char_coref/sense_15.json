{"document": "30 Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return , and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered , opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern . \" How do you do my dear?\" --said she in a voice of great compassion to Marianne , who turned away her face without attempting to answer . \" How is she , Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing ! she looks very bad.-- No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon -- a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men 's going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I wo n't disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . \" She then went away , walking on tiptoe out of the room , as if she supposed her young friend 's affliction could be increased by noise . Marianne , to the surprise of her sister , determined on dining with them . Elinor even advised her against it . But \" no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less . \" Elinor , pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive , though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner , said no more ; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could , while Marianne still remained on the bed , was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it . When there , though looking most wretchedly , she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected . Had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings 's well - meant but ill - judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her . Elinor , who did justice to Mrs. Jennings 's kindness , though its effusions were often distressing , and sometimes almost ridiculous , made her those acknowledgments , and returned her those civilities , which her sister could not make or return for herself . Their good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy , and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so . She treated her therefore , with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays . Marianne was to have the best place by the fire , was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house , and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day . Had not Elinor , in the sad countenance of her sister , seen a check to all mirth , she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings 's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love , by a variety of sweetmeats and olives , and a good fire . As soon , however , as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on Marianne , she could stay no longer . With a hasty exclamation of Misery , and a sign to her sister not to follow her , she directly got up and hurried out of the room . \" Poor soul ! \" cried Mrs. Jennings , as soon as she was gone , \" how it grieves me to see her ! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! And the dried cherries too ! Lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you ! they care no more about such things!-- \" \" The lady then -- Miss Grey I think you called her-- is very rich ? \" \" Fifty thousand pounds , my dear . Did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . But the family are all rich together . Fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it wo n't come before it 's wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . No wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! Well , it do n't signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . Why do n't he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . But that wo n't do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . \" \" Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ? Is she said to be amiable ? \" \" I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree . \"-- \" And who are the Ellisons ? \" \" Her guardians , my dear . But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now , \" after pausing a moment--\"your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself . Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . Well , by - and - by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . What shall we play at ? She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? \" \" Dear ma'am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest . \" \" Aye , I believe that will be best for her . Let her name her own supper , and go to bed . Lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . And so the letter that came today finished it ! Poor soul ! I am sure if I had had a notion of it , I would not have joked her about it for all my money . But then you know , how should I guess such a thing ? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . Lord ! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home , and told them of it . But I shall see them tomorrow . \" \" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . \" \" Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ' tis blown over and forgot . And what does talking ever do you know ? \" \" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby -- he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . \" \" Law , my dear ! Do n't pretend to defend him . No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! \" Elinor , for her sister 's sake , could not press the subject farther , and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby 's ; since , though Marianne might lose much , he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth . After a short silence on both sides , Mrs. Jennings , with all her natural hilarity , burst forth again . \" Well , my dear , ' tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon . He will have her at last ; aye , that he will . Mind me , now , if they an't married by Mid - summer . Lord ! how he 'll chuckle over this news ! I hope he will come tonight . It will be all to one a better match for your sister . Two thousand a year without debt or drawback -- except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ' prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! Lord ! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there ! Then , there is a dove - cote , some delightful stew - ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike - road , so ' tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . Oh ! ' tis a nice place ! A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone 's throw . To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can . One shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head ! \" \" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma'am , \" said Elinor , \" we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . \" And then rising , she went away to join Marianne , whom she found , as she expected , in her own room , leaning , in silent misery , over the small remains of a fire , which , till Elinor 's entrance , had been her only light . \" You had better leave me , \" was all the notice that her sister received from her . \" I will leave you , \" said Elinor , \" if you will go to bed . \" But this , from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering , she at first refused to do . Her sister 's earnest , though gentle persuasion , however , soon softened her to compliance , and Elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow , and as she hoped , in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her . In the drawing - room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings , with a wine - glass , full of something , in her hand . \" My dear , \" said she , entering , \" I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . Do take it to your sister . \" \" Dear Ma'am , \" replied Elinor , smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended , \" how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself . \" Mrs. Jennings , though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier , was satisfied with the compromise ; and Elinor , as she swallowed the chief of it , reflected , that though its effects on a colicky gout were , at present , of little importance to her , its healing powers , on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister . Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea , and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne , Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there , and , in short , that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence . Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought ; for soon after his entrance , she walked across the room to the tea - table where Elinor presided , and whispered-- \" The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see . He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . \" He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her 's , and , with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information , inquired after her sister . \" Marianne is not well , \" said she . \" She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . \" \" Perhaps , then , \" he hesitatingly replied , \" what I heard this morning may be -- there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first . \" \" What did you hear ? \" \" That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think -- in short , that a man , whom I KNEW to be engaged -- but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared . \" \" You mean , \" answered Elinor , with forced calmness , \" Mr. Willoughby 's marriage with Miss Grey . Yes , we DO know it all . This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ? \" \" In a stationer 's shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . Two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey -- it was no longer to be a secret -- it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire . My astonishment!--but it would be impossible to describe what I felt . The communicative lady I learnt , on inquiry , for I stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a Mrs. Ellison , and that , as I have been since informed , is the name of Miss Grey 's guardian . \" \" It is . But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ? In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . \" \" It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable -- at least I think\"--he stopped a moment ; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself , \" And your sister-- how did she-- \" \" Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . \" \" Ah ! \" said Colonel Brandon , \" there is , indeed ! But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ? \" \" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . \" He made no answer ; and soon afterwards , by the removal of the tea - things , and the arrangement of the card parties , the subject was necessarily dropped . Mrs. Jennings , who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking , and who expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood 's communication , in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon 's side , as might have become a man in the bloom of youth , of hope and happiness , saw him , with amazement , remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual . 31 From a night of more sleep than she had expected , Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes . Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt ; and before breakfast was ready , they had gone through the subject again and again ; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor 's side , the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne 's , as before . Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him . At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world , at another she would seclude herself from it for ever , and at a third could resist it with energy . In one thing , however , she was uniform , when it came to the point , in avoiding , where it was possible , the presence of Mrs. Jennings , and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it . Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings 's entering into her sorrows with any compassion . \" No , no , no , it can not be , \" she cried ; \" she can not feel . Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good - nature is not tenderness . All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it . \" Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others , by the irritable refinement of her own mind , and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility , and the graces of a polished manner . Like half the rest of the world , if more than half there be that are clever and good , Marianne , with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition , was neither reasonable nor candid . She expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own , and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself . Thus a circumstance occurred , while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast , which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation ; because , through her own weakness , it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself , though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill . With a letter in her outstretched hand , and countenance gaily smiling , from the persuasion of bringing comfort , she entered their room , saying , \" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good . \" Marianne heard enough . In one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from Willoughby , full of tenderness and contrition , explanatory of all that had passed , satisfactory , convincing ; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself , rushing eagerly into the room to inforce , at her feet , by the eloquence of his eyes , the assurances of his letter . The work of one moment was destroyed by the next . The hand writing of her mother , never till then unwelcome , was before her ; and , in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope , she felt as if , till that instant , she had never suffered . The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language , within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence , could have expressed ; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence -- a reproach , however , so entirely lost on its object , that after many expressions of pity , she withdrew , still referring her to the letter of comfort . But the letter , when she was calm enough to read it , brought little comfort . Willoughby filled every page . Her mother , still confident of their engagement , and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy , had only been roused by Elinor 's application , to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both ; and this , with such tenderness towards her , such affection for Willoughby , and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other , that she wept with agony through the whole of it . All her impatience to be at home again now returned ; her mother was dearer to her than ever ; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby , and she was wildly urgent to be gone . Elinor , unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton , offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother 's wishes could be known ; and at length she obtained her sister 's consent to wait for that knowledge . Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual ; for she could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself ; and positively refusing Elinor 's offered attendance , went out alone for the rest of the morning . Elinor , with a very heavy heart , aware of the pain she was going to communicate , and perceiving , by Marianne 's letter , how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it , then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed , and entreat her directions for the future ; while Marianne , who came into the drawing - room on Mrs. Jennings 's going away , remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote , watching the advancement of her pen , grieving over her for the hardship of such a task , and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother . In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour , when Marianne , whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise , was startled by a rap at the door . \" Who can this be ? \" cried Elinor . \" So early too ! I thought we HAD been safe . \" Marianne moved to the window-- \" It is Colonel Brandon ! \" said she , with vexation . \" We are never safe from HIM . \" \" He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . \" \" I will not trust to THAT , \" retreating to her own room . \" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . \" The event proved her conjecture right , though it was founded on injustice and error ; for Colonel Brandon DID come in ; and Elinor , who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither , and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look , and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her , could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly . \" I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , \" said he , after the first salutation , \" and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing . My object -- my wish -- my sole wish in desiring it -- I hope , I believe it is -- is to be a means of giving comfort;--no , I must not say comfort -- not present comfort -- but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister 's mind . My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- I think I am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ? \" He stopped . \" I understand you , \" said Elinor . \" You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther . Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne . MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and HERS must be gained by it in time . Pray , pray let me hear it . \" \" You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October,--but this will give you no idea -- I must go farther back . You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin . A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it SHALL be a short one . On such a subject , \" sighing heavily , \" can I have little temptation to be diffuse . \" He stopt a moment for recollection , and then , with another sigh , went on . \" You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation-- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne . \" \" Indeed , \" answered Elinor , \" I have NOT forgotten it . \" He looked pleased by this remembrance , and added , \" If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . The same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father . Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Her 's , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever . She was married -- married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered . And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly I relate ! I have never told you how this was brought on . We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland . The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin 's maid betrayed us . I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father 's point was gained . I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one-- but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it . This however was not the case . My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon 's , was but too natural . She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ? Had I remained in England , perhaps -- but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , \" he continued , in a voice of great agitation , \" was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered-- \" He could say no more , and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room . Elinor , affected by his relation , and still more by his distress , could not speak . He saw her concern , and coming to her , took her hand , pressed it , and kissed it with grateful respect . A few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure . \" It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England . My first care , when I DID arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her . Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . So altered -- so faded -- worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her -- but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it -- I have pained you too much already . That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . \" Again he stopped to recover himself ; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern , at the fate of his unfortunate friend . \" Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , \" said he , \" by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation . Their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be . But to what does all this lead ? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing . Ah ! Miss Dashwood -- a subject such as this -- untouched for fourteen years -- it is dangerous to handle it at all ! I WILL be more collected -- more concise . She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old . She loved the child , and had always kept it with her . It was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but I had no family , no home ; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school . I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at Delaford . I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her . It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation . But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared . I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all . He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter 's being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture . What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too . \" \" Good heavens ! \" cried Elinor , \" could it be -- could Willoughby!\" -- \" The first news that reached me of her , \" he continued , \" came in a letter from herself , last October . It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some . Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but HAD he known it , what would it have availed ? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ? No , he had already done that , which no man who CAN feel for another would do . He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address ! He had left her , promising to return ; he neither returned , nor wrote , nor relieved her . \" \" This is beyond every thing ! \" exclaimed Elinor . \" His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . \" Elinor 's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness ; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne , from the communication of what had passed . \" I have been more pained , \" said she , \" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . Have you , \" she continued , after a short silence , \" ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? \" \" Yes , \" he replied gravely , \" once I have . One meeting was unavoidable . \" Elinor , startled by his manner , looked at him anxiously , saying , \" What ? have you met him to-- \" \" I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct . We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad . \" Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this ; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it . \" Such , \" said Colonel Brandon , after a pause , \" has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter ! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust ! \" \" Is she still in town ? \" \" No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . \" Recollecting , soon afterwards , that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister , he put an end to his visit , receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments , and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him .",
