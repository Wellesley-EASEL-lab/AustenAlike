{"document": "12 As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister , which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne 's imprudence and want of thought , surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both . Marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that Willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman . Without considering that it was not in her mother 's plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures . \" He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it , \" she added , \" and when it arrives we will ride every day . You shall share its use with me . Imagine to yourself , my dear Elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . \" Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them . As to an additional servant , the expense would be a trifle ; Mamma she was sure would never object to it ; and any horse would do for HIM ; he might always get one at the park ; as to a stable , the merest shed would be sufficient . Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little , or at least so lately known to her . This was too much . \" You are mistaken , Elinor , \" said she warmly , \" in supposing I know very little of Willoughby . I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;-- it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby . Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed . \" Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more . She knew her sister 's temper . Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion . But by an appeal to her affection for her mother , by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself , if ( as would probably be the case ) she consented to this increase of establishment , Marianne was shortly subdued ; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer , and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next , that it must be declined . She was faithful to her word ; and when Willoughby called at the cottage , the same day , Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice , on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present . The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related , and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible . His concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice,--\"But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . I shall keep it only till you can claim it . When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you . \" This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them . From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident . Margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and Margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves . \" Oh , Elinor ! \" she cried , \" I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon . \" \" You have said so , \" replied Elinor , \" almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . \" \" But indeed this is quite another thing . I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . \" \" Take care , Margaret . It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS . \" \" But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne 's . I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . \" For such particulars , stated on such authority , Elinor could not withhold her credit ; nor was she disposed to it , for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself . Margaret 's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister . When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was Elinor 's particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , Margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , \" I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? \" This of course made every body laugh ; and Elinor tried to laugh too . But the effort was painful . She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings . Marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret , \" Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . \" \" I never had any conjectures about it , \" replied Margaret ; \" it was you who told me of it yourself . \" This increased the mirth of the company , and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more . \" Oh ! pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it , \" said Mrs. Jennings . \" What is the gentleman 's name ? \" \" I must not tell , ma'am . But I know very well what it is ; and I know where he is too . \" \" Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure . He is the curate of the parish I dare say . \" \" No , THAT he is not . He is of no profession at all . \" \" Margaret , \" said Marianne with great warmth , \" you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . \" \" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F. \" Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing , at this moment , \" that it rained very hard , \" though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship 's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother . The idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them . Willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked Marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of Colonel Brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . They contained a noble piece of water ; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning 's amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure . To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;-- and Mrs. Dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home . 13 Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected . She was prepared to be wet through , fatigued , and frightened ; but the event was still more unfortunate , for they did not go at all . By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park , where they were to breakfast . The morning was rather favourable , though it had rained all night , as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky , and the sun frequently appeared . They were all in high spirits and good humour , eager to be happy , and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise . While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in . Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room . \" What is the matter with Brandon ? \" said Sir John . Nobody could tell . \" I hope he has had no bad news , \" said Lady Middleton . \" It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . \" In about five minutes he returned . \" No bad news , Colonel , I hope ; \" said Mrs. Jennings , as soon as he entered the room . \" None at all , ma'am , I thank you . \" \" Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . \" \" No , ma'am . It came from town , and is merely a letter of business . \" \" But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? Come , come , this wo n't do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . \" \" My dear madam , \" said Lady Middleton , \" recollect what you are saying . \" \" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? \" said Mrs. Jennings , without attending to her daughter 's reproof . \" No , indeed , it is not . \" \" Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel . And I hope she is well . \" \" Whom do you mean , ma'am ? \" said he , colouring a little . \" Oh ! you know who I mean . \" \" I am particularly sorry , ma'am , \" said he , addressing Lady Middleton , \" that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . \" \" In town ! \" cried Mrs. Jennings . \" What can you have to do in town at this time of year ? \" \" My own loss is great , \" be continued , \" in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell . \" What a blow upon them all was this ! \" But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr. Brandon , \" said Marianne , eagerly , \" will it not be sufficient ? \" He shook his head . \" We must go , \" said Sir John.--\"It shall not be put off when we are so near it . You can not go to town till tomorrow , Brandon , that is all . \" \" I wish it could be so easily settled . But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! \" \" If you would but let us know what your business is , \" said Mrs. Jennings , \" we might see whether it could be put off or not . \" \" You would not be six hours later , \" said Willoughby , \" if you were to defer your journey till our return . \" \" I can not afford to lose ONE hour . \" -- Elinor then heard Willoughby say , in a low voice to Marianne , \" There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them . He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . \" \" I have no doubt of it , \" replied Marianne . \" There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , \" said Sir John , \" when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it . Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell . \" Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party ; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable . \" Well , then , when will you come back again ? \" \" I hope we shall see you at Barton , \" added her ladyship , \" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return . \" \" You are very obliging . But it is so uncertain , when I may have it in my power to return , that I dare not engage for it at all . \" \" Oh ! he must and shall come back , \" cried Sir John . \" If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him . \" \" Ay , so do , Sir John , \" cried Mrs. Jennings , \" and then perhaps you may find out what his business is . \" \" I do not want to pry into other men 's concerns . I suppose it is something he is ashamed of . \" Colonel Brandon 's horses were announced . \" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ? \" added Sir John . \" No . Only to Honiton . I shall then go post . \" \" Well , as you are resolved to go , I wish you a good journey . But you had better change your mind . \" \" I assure you it is not in my power . \" He then took leave of the whole party . \" Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? \" \" I am afraid , none at all . \" \" Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . \" To Marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing . \" Come Colonel , \" said Mrs. Jennings , \" before you go , do let us know what you are going about . \" He wished her a good morning , and , attended by Sir John , left the room . The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained , now burst forth universally ; and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed . \" I can guess what his business is , however , \" said Mrs. Jennings exultingly . \" Can you , ma'am ? \" said almost every body . \" Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . \" \" And who is Miss Williams ? \" asked Marianne . \" What ! do not you know who Miss Williams is ? I am sure you must have heard of her before . She is a relation of the Colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation . We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . \" Then , lowering her voice a little , she said to Elinor , \" She is his natural daughter . \" \" Indeed ! \" \" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune . \" When Sir John returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country . The carriages were then ordered ; Willoughby 's was first , and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it . He drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . They both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs . It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long . Some more of the Careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which Sir John observed with great contentment . Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods . Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor 's right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and Willoughby , and said to Marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , \" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks . I know where you spent the morning . \" Marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , \" Where , pray?\" -- \" Did not you know , \" said Willoughby , \" that we had been out in my curricle ? \" \" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . \" Marianne turned away in great confusion . Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . As soon as they left the dining - room , Elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true . Marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it . \" Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? \" \" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . \" \" Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . \" \" I am afraid , \" replied Elinor , \" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . \" \" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure . \" \" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? \" \" If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house . They will one day be Mr. Willoughby 's , and-- \" \" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . \" She blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes ' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , \" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . It is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . On one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England . \" Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight .", "clusters":
