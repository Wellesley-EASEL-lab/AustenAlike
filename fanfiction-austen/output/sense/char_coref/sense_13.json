{"document": "26 Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings , and beginning a journey to London under her protection , and as her guest , without wondering at her own situation , so short had their acquaintance with that lady been , so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition , and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before ! But these objections had all , with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared , been overcome or overlooked ; and Elinor , in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby 's constancy , could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne , without feeling how blank was her own prospect , how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison , and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne 's situation to have the same animating object in view , the same possibility of hope . A short , a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby 's intentions were ; in all probability he was already in town . Marianne 's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there ; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her , but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention , as to ascertain what he was and what he meant , before many meetings had taken place . Should the result of her observations be unfavourable , she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister ; should it be otherwise , her exertions would be of a different nature -- she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison , and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne . They were three days on their journey , and Marianne 's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be . She sat in silence almost all the way , wrapt in her own meditations , and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking , except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister . To atone for this conduct therefore , Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself , behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings , talked with her , laughed with her , and listened to her whenever she could ; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness , was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment , and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn , nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod , or boiled fowls to veal cutlets . They reached town by three o'clock the third day , glad to be released , after such a journey , from the confinement of a carriage , and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire . The house was handsome , and handsomely fitted up , and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment . It had formerly been Charlotte 's , and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance , in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect . As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival , Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother , and sat down for that purpose . In a few moments Marianne did the same . \" I am writing home , Marianne , \" said Elinor ; \" had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ? \" \" I am NOT going to write to my mother , \" replied Marianne , hastily , and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry . Elinor said no more ; it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby ; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was , that , however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair , they must be engaged . This conviction , though not entirely satisfactory , gave her pleasure , and she continued her letter with greater alacrity . Marianne 's was finished in a very few minutes ; in length it could be no more than a note ; it was then folded up , sealed , and directed with eager rapidity . Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the direction ; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne , ringing the bell , requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two - penny post . This decided the matter at once . Her spirits still continued very high ; but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister , and this agitation increased as the evening drew on . She could scarcely eat any dinner , and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room , seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage . It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings , by being much engaged in her own room , could see little of what was passing . The tea things were brought in , and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door , when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house , Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby 's approach , and Marianne , starting up , moved towards the door . Every thing was silent ; this could not be borne many seconds ; she opened the door , advanced a few steps towards the stairs , and after listening half a minute , returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce ; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming , \" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! \" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms , when Colonel Brandon appeared . It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness , and she immediately left the room . Elinor was disappointed too ; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her ; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him . She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him , that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room , with such astonishment and concern , as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself . \" Is your sister ill ? \" said he . Elinor answered in some distress that she was , and then talked of head - aches , low spirits , and over fatigues ; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister 's behaviour . He heard her with the most earnest attention , but seeming to recollect himself , said no more on the subject , and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London , making the usual inquiries about their journey , and the friends they had left behind . In this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere . Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last . \" Yes , \" he replied , with some embarrassment , \" almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . \" This , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt . Mrs. Jennings soon came in . \" Oh ! Colonel , \" said she , with her usual noisy cheerfulness , \" I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with-- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ? \" \" I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer 's , where I have been dining . \" \" Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . \" \" Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . \" \" Ay , to be sure , I thought as much . Well , Colonel , I have brought two young ladies with me , you see -- that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . Your friend , Miss Marianne , too -- which you will not be sorry to hear . I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her . Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . Well ! I was young once , but I never was very handsome -- worse luck for me . However , I got a very good husband , and I do n't know what the greatest beauty can do more . Ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ? And how does your business go on ? Come , come , let 's have no secrets among friends . \" He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries , but without satisfying her in any . Elinor now began to make the tea , and Marianne was obliged to appear again . After her entrance , Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before , and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long . No other visitor appeared that evening , and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed . Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks . The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day . They had not long finished their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer 's barouche stopped at the door , and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room : so delighted to see them all , that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again . So surprised at their coming to town , though it was what she had rather expected all along ; so angry at their accepting her mother 's invitation after having declined her own , though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come ! \" Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , \" said she ; \" What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! \" After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat , or in other words , in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings 's side , and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer 's , it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning , to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented , as having likewise some purchases to make themselves ; and Marianne , though declining it at first was induced to go likewise . Wherever they went , she was evidently always on the watch . In Bond Street especially , where much of their business lay , her eyes were in constant inquiry ; and in whatever shop the party were engaged , her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them , from all that interested and occupied the others . Restless and dissatisfied every where , her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase , however it might equally concern them both : she received no pleasure from anything ; was only impatient to be at home again , and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer , whose eye was caught by every thing pretty , expensive , or new ; who was wild to buy all , could determine on none , and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision . It was late in the morning before they returned home ; and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs , and when Elinor followed , she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance , which declared that no Willoughby had been there . \" Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ? \" said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels . She was answered in the negative . \" Are you quite sure of it ? \" she replied . \" Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ? \" The man replied that none had . \" How very odd ! \" said she , in a low and disappointed voice , as she turned away to the window . \" How odd , indeed ! \" repeated Elinor within herself , regarding her sister with uneasiness . \" If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! Oh ! my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! I long to inquire ; and how will MY interference be borne . \" She determined , after some consideration , that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were , she would represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair . Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings 's intimate acquaintance , whom she had met and invited in the morning , dined with them . The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements ; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others . Marianne was of no use on these occasions , as she would never learn the game ; but though her time was therefore at her own disposal , the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor , for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment . She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read ; but the book was soon thrown aside , and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room , pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window , in hopes of distinguishing the long - expected rap . 27 \" If this open weather holds much longer , \" said Mrs. Jennings , when they met at breakfast the following morning , \" Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ' tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day 's pleasure . Poor souls ! I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . \" \" That is true , \" cried Marianne , in a cheerful voice , and walking to the window as she spoke , to examine the day . \" I had not thought of that . This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . \" It was a lucky recollection , all her good spirits were restored by it . \" It is charming weather for THEM indeed , \" she continued , as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance . \" How much they must enjoy it ! But \" ( with a little return of anxiety ) \" it can not be expected to last long . At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer -- nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! \" \" At any rate , \" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister 's thoughts as clearly as she did , \" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . \" \" Ay , my dear , I 'll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way . \" \" And now , \" silently conjectured Elinor , \" she will write to Combe by this day 's post . \" But if she DID , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact . Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself . And Marianne was in spirits ; happy in the mildness of the weather , and still happier in her expectation of a frost . The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs. Jennings 's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town ; and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind , watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air . \" Do n't you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ? There seems to me a very decided difference . I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think . The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon . \" Elinor was alternately diverted and pained ; but Marianne persevered , and saw every night in the brightness of the fire , and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere , the certain symptoms of approaching frost . The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings 's style of living , and set of acquaintance , than with her behaviour to themselves , which was invariably kind . Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton 's regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions . Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her . Colonel Brandon , who had a general invitation to the house , was with them almost every day ; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor , who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence , but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister . She feared it was a strengthening regard . It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton . About a week after their arrival , it became certain that Willoughby was also arrived . His card was on the table when they came in from the morning 's drive . \" Good God ! \" cried Marianne , \" he has been here while we were out . \" Elinor , rejoiced to be assured of his being in London , now ventured to say , \" Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow . \" But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her , and on Mrs. Jenning 's entrance , escaped with the precious card . This event , while it raised the spirits of Elinor , restored to those of her sister all , and more than all , their former agitation . From this moment her mind was never quiet ; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day , made her unfit for any thing . She insisted on being left behind , the next morning , when the others went out . Elinor 's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence ; but a moment 's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that Willoughby had paid no second visit there . A note was just then brought in , and laid on the table , \" For me ! \" cried Marianne , stepping hastily forward . \" No , ma'am , for my mistress . \" But Marianne , not convinced , took it instantly up . \" It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! \" \" You are expecting a letter , then ? \" said Elinor , unable to be longer silent . \" Yes , a little -- not much . \" After a short pause . \" You have no confidence in me , Marianne . \" \" Nay , Elinor , this reproach from YOU -- you who have confidence in no one ! \" \" Me ! \" returned Elinor in some confusion ; \" indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell . \" \" Nor I , \" answered Marianne with energy , \" our situations then are alike . We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . \" Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne . Mrs. Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud . It was from Lady Middleton , announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before , and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening . Business on Sir John 's part , and a violent cold on her own , prevented their calling in Berkeley Street . The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence . Elinor found , when the evening was over , that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode , for although scarcely settled in town , Sir John had contrived to collect around him , nearly twenty young people , and to amuse them with a ball . This was an affair , however , of which Lady Middleton did not approve . In the country , an unpremeditated dance was very allowable ; but in London , where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained , it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls , to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple , with two violins , and a mere side - board collation . Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party ; from the former , whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town , as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother - in - law , and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance . He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room . Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure . After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come . \" I thought you were both in Devonshire , \" said he . \" Did you ? \" replied Elinor . \" When do you go back again ? \" \" I do not know . \" And thus ended their discourse . Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life , as she was that evening , and never so much fatigued by the exercise . She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street . \" Aye , aye , \" said Mrs. Jennings , \" we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . \" \" Invited ! \" cried Marianne . \" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . \" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister 's relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation . Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced . Marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it . He looked more than usually grave , and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone , as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her , sat for some time without saying a word . Elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening . It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of \" your sister looks unwell to - day , \" or \" your sister seems out of spirits , \" he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her . After a pause of several minutes , their silence was broken , by his asking her in a voice of some agitation , when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother ? Elinor was not prepared for such a question , and having no answer ready , was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient , of asking what he meant ? He tried to smile as he replied , \" your sister 's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . \" \" It can not be generally known , \" returned Elinor , \" for her own family do not know it . \" He looked surprised and said , \" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of . \" \" How can that be ? By whom can you have heard it mentioned ? \" \" By many -- by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons . But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister 's writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to- ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . \" These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much . She was not immediately able to say anything , and even when her spirits were recovered , she debated for a short time , on the answer it would be most proper to give . The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself , that in endeavouring to explain it , she might be as liable to say too much as too little . Yet as she was convinced that Marianne 's affection for Willoughby , could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon 's success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed . She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear . He listened to her with silent attention , and on her ceasing to speak , rose directly from his seat , and after saying in a voice of emotion , \" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave , and went away . Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon 's unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Elinor"},
