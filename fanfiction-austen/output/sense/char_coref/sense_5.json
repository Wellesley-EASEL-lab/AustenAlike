{"document": "10 Marianne 's preserver , as Margaret , with more elegance than precision , styled Willoughby , called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries . He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness ; with a kindness which Sir John 's account of him and her own gratitude prompted ; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense , elegance , mutual affection , and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him . Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced . Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion , regular features , and a remarkably pretty figure . Marianne was still handsomer . Her form , though not so correct as her sister 's , in having the advantage of height , was more striking ; and her face was so lovely , that when in the common ca nt of praise , she was called a beautiful girl , truth was less violently outraged than usually happens . Her skin was very brown , but , from its transparency , her complexion was uncommonly brilliant ; her features were all good ; her smile was sweet and attractive ; and in her eyes , which were very dark , there was a life , a spirit , an eagerness , which could hardily be seen without delight . From Willoughby their expression was at first held back , by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created . But when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good - breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay . It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk . She could not be silent when such points were introduced , and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion . They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual , and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either . Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions , she proceeded to question him on the subject of books ; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight , that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed , not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works , however disregarded before . Their taste was strikingly alike . The same books , the same passages were idolized by each-- or if any difference appeared , any objection arose , it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed . He acquiesced in all her decisions , caught all her enthusiasm ; and long before his visit concluded , they conversed with the familiarity of a long - established acquaintance . \" Well , Marianne , \" said Elinor , as soon as he had left them , \" for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well . You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby 's opinion in almost every matter of importance . You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper . But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . \"-- \" Elinor , \" cried Marianne , \" is this fair ? is this just ? are my ideas so scanty ? But I see what you mean . I have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . I have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful -- had I talked only of the weather and the roads , and had I spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . \" \" My love , \" said her mother , \" you must not be offended with Elinor -- she was only in jest . I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . \"-- Marianne was softened in a moment . Willoughby , on his side , gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance , which an evident wish of improving it could offer . He came to them every day . To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by Marianne 's perfect recovery . She was confined for some days to the house ; but never had any confinement been less irksome . Willoughby was a young man of good abilities , quick imagination , lively spirits , and open , affectionate manners . He was exactly formed to engage Marianne 's heart , for with all this , he joined not only a captivating person , but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own , and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else . His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment . They read , they talked , they sang together ; his musical talents were considerable ; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted . In Mrs. Dashwood 's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne 's ; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances . In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people , in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged , and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety , he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve , in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support . Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half , of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection , had been rash and unjustifiable . Willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period , as capable of attaching her ; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest , as his abilities were strong . Her mother too , in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised , by his prospect of riches , was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it ; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons - in - law as Edward and Willoughby . Colonel Brandon 's partiality for Marianne , which had so early been discovered by his friends , now first became perceptible to Elinor , when it ceased to be noticed by them . Their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival ; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose , was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility . Elinor was obliged , though unwillingly , to believe that the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction , were now actually excited by her sister ; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon . She saw it with concern ; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope , when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty ? and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent . She liked him -- in spite of his gravity and reserve , she beheld in him an object of interest . His manners , though serious , were mild ; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper . Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion . Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits . \" Brandon is just the kind of man , \" said Willoughby one day , when they were talking of him together , \" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . \" \" That is exactly what I think of him , \" cried Marianne . \" Do not boast of it , however , \" said Elinor , \" for it is injustice in both of you . He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . \" \" That he is patronised by YOU , \" replied Willoughby , \" is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? \" \" But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother . If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . \" \" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy . \" \" My protege , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . Yes , Marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . \" \" That is to say , \" cried Marianne contemptuously , \" he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . \" \" He WOULD have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . \" \" Perhaps , \" said Willoughby , \" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . \" \" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour . But why should you dislike him ? \" \" I do not dislike him . I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body 's good word , and nobody 's notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . \" \" Add to which , \" cried Marianne , \" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . \" \" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , \" replied Elinor , \" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart . \" \" Miss Dashwood , \" cried Willoughby , \" you are now using me unkindly . You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . But it will not do . You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , I am ready to confess it . And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . \" 11 Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment . Yet such was the case . When Marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which Sir John had been previously forming , were put into execution . The private balls at the park then began ; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow . In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection . Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment . She only wished that it were less openly shewn ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self - command to Marianne . But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common - place and mistaken notions . Willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions . When he was present she had no eyes for any one else . Every thing he did , was right . Every thing he said , was clever . If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand . If dancing formed the amusement of the night , they were partners for half the time ; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances , were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else . Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at ; but ridicule could not shame , and seemed hardly to provoke them . Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them . To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind . This was the season of happiness to Marianne . Her heart was devoted to Willoughby , and the fond attachment to Norland , which she brought with her from Sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home . Elinor 's happiness was not so great . Her heart was not so much at ease , nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure . They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever . Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse . She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times ; and had Elinor 's memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jenning 's last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died . Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent . Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do . Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired . She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before . Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . In Colonel Brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . Willoughby was out of the question . Her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly Marianne 's , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing . Colonel Brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne , and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . Elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . His eyes were fixed on Marianne , and , after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , \" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . \" \" No , \" replied Elinor , \" her opinions are all romantic . \" \" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . \" \" I believe she does . But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not . A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . \" \" This will probably be the case , \" he replied ; \" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . \" \" I can not agree with you there , \" said Elinor . \" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne 's , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . \" After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,-- \" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? \" \" Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment 's being pardonable . \" \" This , \" said he , \" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"-- Here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered Elinor 's head . The lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips . As it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard . Elinor attempted no more . But Marianne , in her place , would not have done so little . The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position":
