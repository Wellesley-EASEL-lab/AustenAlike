{"document": "22 Marianne , who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence , vulgarity , inferiority of parts , or even difference of taste from herself , was at this time particularly ill - disposed , from the state of her spirits , to be pleased with the Miss Steeles , or to encourage their advances ; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them , which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side , Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both , but especially of Lucy , who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation , or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments . Lucy was naturally clever ; her remarks were often just and amusing ; and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable ; but her powers had received no aid from education : she was ignorant and illiterate ; and her deficiency of all mental improvement , her want of information in the most common particulars , could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood , in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage . Elinor saw , and pitied her for , the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable ; but she saw , with less tenderness of feeling , the thorough want of delicacy , of rectitude , and integrity of mind , which her attentions , her assiduities , her flatteries at the Park betrayed ; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance ; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality , and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless . \" You will think my question an odd one , I dare say , \" said Lucy to her one day , as they were walking together from the park to the cottage--\"but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister - in - law 's mother , Mrs. Ferrars ? \" Elinor DID think the question a very odd one , and her countenance expressed it , as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars . \" Indeed ! \" replied Lucy ; \" I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . Then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? \" \" No , \" returned Elinor , cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward 's mother , and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity-- \" I know nothing of her . \" \" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , \" said Lucy , eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke ; \" but perhaps there may be reasons -- I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent . \" Elinor made her a civil reply , and they walked on for a few minutes in silence . It was broken by Lucy , who renewed the subject again by saying , with some hesitation , \" I can not bear to have you think me impertinently curious . I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU ; indeed , I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation as I am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble YOU . I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars . \" \" I am sorry I do NOT , \" said Elinor , in great astonishment , \" if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . \" \" I dare say you are , and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it . But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present -- but the time MAY come -- how soon it will come must depend upon herself -- when we may be very intimately connected . \" She looked down as she said this , amiably bashful , with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her . \" Good heavens ! \" cried Elinor , \" what do you mean ? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars ? Can you be ? \" And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister - in - law . \" No , \" replied Lucy , \" not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars -- I never saw him in my life ; but , \" fixing her eyes upon Elinor , \" to his eldest brother . \" What felt Elinor at that moment ? Astonishment , that would have been as painful as it was strong , had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it . She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement , unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration ; and though her complexion varied , she stood firm in incredulity , and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit , or a swoon . \" You may well be surprised , \" continued Lucy ; \" for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained . And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters . \" --She paused . Elinor for a few moments remained silent . Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words ; but at length forcing herself to speak , and to speak cautiously , she said , with calmness of manner , which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- \" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ? \" \" We have been engaged these four years . \" \" Four years ! \" \" Yes . \" Elinor , though greatly shocked , still felt unable to believe it . \" I did not know , \" said she , \" that you were even acquainted till the other day . \" \" Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . He was under my uncle 's care , you know , a considerable while . \" \" Your uncle ! \" \" Yes ; Mr. Pratt . Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt ? \" \" I think I have , \" replied Elinor , with an exertion of spirits , which increased with her increase of emotion . \" He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . \" \" Certainly , \" answered Elinor , without knowing what she said ; but after a moment 's reflection , she added , with revived security of Edward 's honour and love , and her companion 's falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really -- I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . We can not mean the same Mr. Ferrars . \" \" We can mean no other , \" cried Lucy , smiling . \" Mr. Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs. John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . \" \" It is strange , \" replied Elinor , in a most painful perplexity , \" that I should never have heard him even mention your name . \" \" No ; considering our situation , it was not strange . Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me , or my family , and , therefore , there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name to you ; and , as he was always particularly afraid of his sister 's suspecting any thing , THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it . \" She was silent.--Elinor 's security sunk ; but her self - command did not sink with it . \" Four years you have been engaged , \" said she with a firm voice . \" Yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait . Poor Edward ! It puts him quite out of heart . \" Then taking a small miniature from her pocket , she added , \" To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face . It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years . \" She put it into her hands as she spoke ; and when Elinor saw the painting , whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision , or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind , she could have none of its being Edward 's face . She returned it almost instantly , acknowledging the likeness . \" I have never been able , \" continued Lucy , \" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity . \" \" You are quite in the right , \" replied Elinor calmly . They then proceeded a few paces in silence . Lucy spoke first . \" I am sure , \" said she , \" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say . I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman . \" \" I certainly did not seek your confidence , \" said Elinor ; \" but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on . Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . \" As she said this , she looked earnestly at Lucy , hoping to discover something in her countenance ; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying ; but Lucy 's countenance suffered no change . \" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , \" said she , \" in telling you all this . I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me . She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . You ca n't think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether . I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward 's sake these last four years . Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a - year . I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . \" Here she took out her handkerchief ; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate . \" Sometimes . \" continued Lucy , after wiping her eyes , \" I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely . \" As she said this , she looked directly at her companion . \" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do . And on my own account too -- so dear as he is to me -- I do n't think I could be equal to it . What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ? What would you do yourself ? \" \" Pardon me , \" replied Elinor , startled by the question ; \" but I can give you no advice under such circumstances . Your own judgment must direct you . \" \" To be sure , \" continued Lucy , after a few minutes silence on both sides , \" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it ! Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . \" \" Did he come from your uncle 's , then , when he visited us ? \" \" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ? \" \" No , \" replied Elinor , most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy 's veracity ; \" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . \" She remembered too , her own surprise at the time , at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends , at his total silence with respect even to their names . \" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? \" repeated Lucy . \" We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived . \" \" I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits . I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; \" taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor . \" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible . \" Elinor saw that it WAS his hand , and she could doubt no longer . This picture , she had allowed herself to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been Edward 's gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for the time complete . \" Writing to each other , \" said Lucy , returning the letter into her pocket , \" is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT . If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ? \" \" I did , \" said Elinor , with a composure of voice , under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before . She was mortified , shocked , confounded . Fortunately for her , they had now reached the cottage , and the conversation could be continued no farther . After sitting with them a few minutes , the Miss Steeles returned to the Park , and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched . [ At this point in the first and second editions , Volume 1 ends . ] 23 However small Elinor 's general dependence on Lucy 's veracity might be , it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case , where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description . What Lucy had asserted to be true , therefore , Elinor could not , dared not longer doubt ; supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs , and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes . Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest , at once indisputable and alarming ; and Edward 's visit near Plymouth , his melancholy state of mind , his dissatisfaction at his own prospects , his uncertain behaviour towards herself , the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections , which had often surprised her , the picture , the letter , the ring , formed altogether such a body of evidence , as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly , and established as a fact , which no partiality could set aside , his ill - treatment of herself.--Her resentment of such behaviour , her indignation at having been its dupe , for a short time made her feel only for herself ; but other ideas , other considerations , soon arose . Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her ? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel ? Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart ? No ; whatever it might once have been , she could not believe it such at present . His affection was all her own . She could not be deceived in that . Her mother , sisters , Fanny , all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland ; it was not an illusion of her own vanity . He certainly loved her . What a softener of the heart was this persuasion ! How much could it not tempt her to forgive ! He had been blamable , highly blamable , in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be . In that , he could not be defended ; but if he had injured her , how much more had he injured himself ; if her case were pitiable , his was hopeless . His imprudence had made her miserable for a while ; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise . She might in time regain tranquillity ; but HE , what had he to look forward to ? Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele ; could he , were his affection for herself out of the question , with his integrity , his delicacy , and well - informed mind , be satisfied with a wife like her -- illiterate , artful , and selfish ? The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature ; but the four succeeding years -- years , which if rationally spent , give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education , while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits , had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty . If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself . These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief ! As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself . Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters . And so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house . The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor 's distress . On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support . From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise . She was stronger alone , and her own good sense so well supported her , that her firmness was as unshaken , her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable , as with regrets so poignant and so fresh , it was possible for them to be . Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject , she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one . She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful . That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy 's assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important . And even Sir John 's joking intelligence must have had some weight . But indeed , while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous ; and that she was so , her very confidence was a proof . What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be , but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy 's superior claims on Edward , and be taught to avoid him in future ? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival 's intentions , and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed , to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible ; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded . And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told , she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure . But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded , though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred ; for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk , where they might most easily separate themselves from the others ; and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage , and chiefly at the former , they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation . Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton 's head ; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat , and none at all for particular discourse . They met for the sake of eating , drinking , and laughing together , playing at cards , or consequences , or any other game that was sufficiently noisy . One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise . The young ladies went , and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her . The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected ; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression , and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room : to the latter , the children accompanied them , and while they remained there , she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy 's attention to attempt it . They quitted it only with the removal of the tea - things . The card - table was then placed , and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park . They all rose up in preparation for a round game . \" I am glad , \" said Lady Middleton to Lucy , \" you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria 's basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it . \" This hint was enough , Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied , \" Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already . I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper . \" \" You are very good , I hope it wo n't hurt your eyes-- will you ring the bell for some working candles ? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done . \" Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child . Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others . No one made any objection but Marianne , who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility , exclaimed , \" Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME -- you know I detest cards . I shall go to the piano - forte ; I have not touched it since it was tuned . \" And without farther ceremony , she turned away and walked to the instrument . Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made so rude a speech . \" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma'am , \" said Elinor , endeavouring to smooth away the offence ; \" and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . \" The remaining five were now to draw their cards . \" Perhaps , \" continued Elinor , \" if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . \" \" Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help , \" cried Lucy , \" for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all . \" \" Oh ! that would be terrible , indeed , \" said Miss Steele-- \" Dear little soul , how I do love her ! \" \" You are very kind , \" said Lady Middleton to Elinor ; \" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? \" Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals , and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise , gained her own end , and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time . Lucy made room for her with ready attention , and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table , and , with the utmost harmony , engaged in forwarding the same work . The pianoforte at which Marianne , wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts , had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself , was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely , under the shelter of its noise , introduce the interesting subject , without any risk of being heard at the card - table .", "clusters": [{"mentions":
