{"document": "40 \" Well , Miss Dashwood , \" said Mrs. Jennings , sagaciously smiling , as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn , \" I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I TRIED to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business . And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart . \" \" Thank you , ma'am , \" said Elinor . \" It is a matter of great joy to me ; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly . There are not many men who would act as he has done . Few people who have so compassionate a heart ! I never was more astonished in my life . \" \" Lord ! my dear , you are very modest . I an't the least astonished at it in the world , for I have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen . \" \" You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel 's general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur . \" \" Opportunity ! \" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh ! as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity . Well , my dear , I wish you joy of it again and again ; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world , I think I shall soon know where to look for them . \" \" You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose , \" said Elinor , with a faint smile . \" Aye , my dear , that I do , indeed . And as to the house being a bad one , I do not know what the Colonel would be at , for it is as good a one as ever I saw . \" \" He spoke of its being out of repair . \" \" Well , and whose fault is that ? why do n't he repair it?-- who should do it but himself ? \" They were interrupted by the servant 's coming in to announce the carriage being at the door ; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to go , said,-- \" Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out . But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it . \" Marianne had left the room before the conversation began . \" Certainly , ma'am , I shall tell Marianne of it ; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else . \" \" Oh ! very well , \" said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed . \" Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy , for I think of going as far as Holborn to - day . \" \" No , ma'am , not even Lucy if you please . One day 's delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . I shall do THAT directly . It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . \" This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly . Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry , she could not immediately comprehend . A few moments ' reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed;-- \" Oh , ho!--I understand you . Mr. Ferrars is to be the man . Well , so much the better for him . Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? Should not the Colonel write himself?--sure , he is the proper person . \" Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings 's speech , neither did she think it worth inquiring into ; and therefore only replied to its conclusion . \" Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man , that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself . \" \" And so YOU are forced to do it . Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy ! However , I will not disturb you ( seeing her preparing to write . ) You know your own concerns best . So goodby , my dear . I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed . \" And away she went ; but returning again in a moment , \" I have just been thinking of Betty 's sister , my dear . I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . But whether she would do for a lady 's maid , I am sure I ca n't tell . She is an excellent housemaid , and works very well at her needle . However , you will think of all that at your leisure . \" \" Certainly , ma'am , \" replied Elinor , not hearing much of what she said , and more anxious to be alone , than to be mistress of the subject . How she should begin -- how she should express herself in her note to Edward , was now all her concern . The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world ; but she equally feared to say too much or too little , and sat deliberating over her paper , with the pen in her band , till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself . He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage , as he came to leave his farewell card ; and she , after apologising for not returning herself , had obliged him to enter , by saying that Miss Dashwood was above , and wanted to speak with him on very particular business . Elinor had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity , that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter , it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth , when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all . Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance . She had not seen him before since his engagement became public , and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it ; which , with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of , and what she had to tell him , made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes . He too was much distressed ; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room , he could not recollect ; but determining to be on the safe side , he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing , after taking a chair . \" Mrs. Jennings told me , \" said he , \" that you wished to speak with me , at least I understood her so -- or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner ; though at the same time , I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister ; especially as it will most likely be some time -- it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again . I go to Oxford tomorrow . \" \" You would not have gone , however , \" said Elinor , recovering herself , and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible , \" without receiving our good wishes , even if we had not been able to give them in person . Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said . I have something of consequence to inform you of , which I was on the point of communicating by paper . I am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke . ) Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living -- it is about two hundred a - year -- were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to -- as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself -- such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness . \" What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it can not be expected that any one else should say for him . He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected , such unthought - of information could not fail of exciting ; but he said only these two words , \" Colonel Brandon ! \" \" Yes , \" continued Elinor , gathering more resolution , as some of the worst was over , \" Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed -- for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you -- a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion . \" \" Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible ? \" \" The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where . \" \" No , \" replied be , with sudden consciousness , \" not to find it in YOU ; for I can not be ignorant that to you , to your goodness , I owe it all.--I feel it -- I would express it if I could -- but , as you well know , I am no orator . \" \" You are very much mistaken . I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon 's discernment of it . I have had no hand in it . I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift . As a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps -- indeed I know he HAS , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation . \" Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it . For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak;--at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said , \" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability . I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly . He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . \" \" Indeed , \" replied Elinor , \" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this . \" Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater . \" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St. James Street , \" said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair . Elinor told him the number of the house . \" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man . \" Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on HIS , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it . \" When I see him again , \" said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , \" I shall see him the husband of Lucy . \" And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent . When Mrs. Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared . \" Well , my dear , \" she cried , \" I sent you up to the young man . Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? \" \" No , ma'am ; THAT was not very likely . \" \" Well , and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon that . \" \" Really , \" said Elinor , \" I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination . \" \" Two or three months ! \" cried Mrs. Jennings ; \" Lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months ! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . \" \" My dear ma'am , \" said Elinor , \" what can you be thinking of?-- Why , Colonel Brandon 's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . \" \" Lord bless you , my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! \" The deception could not continue after this ; and an explanation immediately took place , by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment , without any material loss of happiness to either , for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another , and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first . \" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , \" said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , \" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!-- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it . \" \" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry . \" \" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas ; and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . \" Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . 41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life . Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas . So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood 's part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry . It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife 's indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions . Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike . Mrs. Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out . He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in . They walked up stairs in to the drawing - room.--Nobody was there . \" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , \" said he:--\"I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it , indeed . NOW especially there can not be -- but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?\" -- Elinor made what excuse she could for her . \" I am not sorry to see you alone , \" he replied , \" for I have a good deal to say to you . This living of Colonel Brandon's -- can it be true?--has he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . \" \" It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward . \" \" Really!--Well , this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this ? \" \" About two hundred a year . \" \" Very well -- and for the next presentation to a living of that value -- supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon -- he might have got I dare say -- fourteen hundred pounds . And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person 's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of Colonel Brandon 's sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern!--Well , I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . I suppose , however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be THIS . Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it.--Aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it . \" Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority . \" It is truly astonishing!\" --he cried , after hearing what she said--\"what could be the Colonel 's motive ? \" \" A very simple one -- to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . \" \" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear it much talked of . \" Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished . \" Mrs. Ferrars , \" added he , lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject , \" knows nothing about it at present , and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.-- When the marriage takes place , I fear she must hear of it all . \" \" But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise . Surely , after doing so , she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account-- she can not be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent ! \" \" Ah ! Elinor , \" said John , \" your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature . When Edward 's unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible . Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . \" \" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time . \" \" You wrong her exceedingly . Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world . \" Elinor was silent . \" We think NOW,\"--said Mr. Dashwood , after a short pause , \" of ROBERT 'S marrying Miss Morton . \" Elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother 's tone , calmly replied , \" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair . \" \" Choice!--how do you mean ? \" \" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . \" \" Certainly , there can be no difference ; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other . \" Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent.--His reflections ended thus . \" Of ONE thing , my dear sister , \" kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper,--\"I may assure you;-- and I WILL do it , because I know it must gratify you . I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter DID , and I have it from her -- That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does . I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light-- a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all . ' It would have been beyond comparison , ' she said , ' the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse . ' But however , all that is quite out of the question -- not to be thought of or mentioned-- as to any attachment you know -- it never could be -- all that is gone by . But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you . Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor . There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well -- quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered . Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately ? \" Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars . After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart . They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves , before he began to speak of Edward ; for he , too , had heard of the living , and was very inquisitive on the subject . Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on HIM . He laughed most immoderately . The idea of Edward 's being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage - house , diverted him beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous . Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of her 's , but by his own sensibility . \" We may treat it as a joke , \" said he , at last , recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--\"but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business . Poor Edward ! he is ruined for ever . I am extremely sorry for it-- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!-- to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . I could not believe it.-- My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again . ' That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . My poor mother was half frantic . \" \" Have you ever seen the lady ? \" \" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her . The merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty.-- I remember her perfectly . Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward . I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier -- I think it is most probable -- that something might have been hit on . I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light . ' My dear fellow , ' I should have said , ' consider what you are doing . You are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving . ' I can not help thinking , in short , that means might have been found . But now it is all too late . He must be starved , you know;-- that is certain ; absolutely starved . \" He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject . But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family , Elinor could see its influence on her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself . She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 11], "text": "Mrs.
