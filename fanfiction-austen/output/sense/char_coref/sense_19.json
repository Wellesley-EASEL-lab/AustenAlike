{"document": "38 Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward 's conduct , but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit . THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient , and how small was the consolation , beyond the consciousness of doing right , that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune . Elinor gloried in his integrity ; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment . But though confidence between them was , by this public discovery , restored to its proper state , it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone . Elinor avoided it upon principle , as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts , by the too warm , too positive assurances of Marianne , that belief of Edward 's continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away ; and Marianne 's courage soon failed her , in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever , by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor 's conduct and her own . She felt all the force of that comparison ; but not as her sister had hoped , to urge her to exertion now ; she felt it with all the pain of continual self - reproach , regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before ; but it brought only the torture of penitence , without the hope of amendment . Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible , and therefore it only dispirited her more . Nothing new was heard by them , for a day or two afterwards , of affairs in Harley Street , or Bartlett 's Buildings . But though so much of the matter was known to them already , that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther , without seeking after more , she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could ; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual , had prevented her going to them within that time . The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars , was so fine , so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens , though it was only the second week in March . Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number ; but Marianne , who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town , and had a constant dread of meeting them , chose rather to stay at home , than venture into so public a place . An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens , and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them , and engaging all Mrs. Jennings 's conversation , she was herself left to quiet reflection . She saw nothing of the Willoughbys , nothing of Edward , and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay , be interesting to her . But at last she found herself with some surprise , accosted by Miss Steele , who , though looking rather shy , expressed great satisfaction in meeting them , and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings , left her own party for a short time , to join their 's . Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor , \" Get it all out of her , my dear . She will tell you any thing if you ask . You see I can not leave Mrs. Clarke . \" It was lucky , however , for Mrs. Jennings 's curiosity and Elinor 's too , that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked ; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt . \" I am so glad to meet you ; \" said Miss Steele , taking her familiarly by the arm--\"for I wanted to see you of all things in the world . \" And then lowering her voice , \" I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it . Is she angry ? \" \" Not at all , I believe , with you . \" \" That is a good thing . And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ? \" \" I can not suppose it possible that she should . \" \" I am monstrous glad of it . Good gracious ! I have had such a time of it ! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life . She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet , nor do any thing else for me again , so long as she lived ; but now she is quite come to , and we are as good friends as ever . Look , she made me this bow to my hat , and put in the feather last night . There now , YOU are going to laugh at me too . But why should not I wear pink ribbons ? I do not care if it IS the Doctor 's favourite colour . I am sure , for my part , I should never have known he DID like it better than any other colour , if he had not happened to say so . My cousins have been so plaguing me ! I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them . \" She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say , and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first . \" Well , but Miss Dashwood , \" speaking triumphantly , \" people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars 's declaring he would not have Lucy , for it is no such thing I can tell you ; and it is quite a shame for such ill - natured reports to be spread abroad . Whatever Lucy might think about it herself , you know , it was no business of other people to set it down for certain . \" \" I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before , I assure you , \" said Elinor . \" Oh , did not you ? But it WAS said , I know , very well , and by more than one ; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks , that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton , with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune , for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all ; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself . And besides that , my cousin Richard said himself , that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off ; and when Edward did not come near us for three days , I could not tell what to think myself ; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost ; for we came away from your brother 's Wednesday , and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday , Friday , and Saturday , and did not know what was become of him . Once Lucy thought to write to him , but then her spirits rose against that . However this morning he came just as we came home from church ; and then it all came out , how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street , and been talked to by his mother and all of them , and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy , and nobody but Lucy would he have . And how he had been so worried by what passed , that as soon as he had went away from his mother 's house , he had got upon his horse , and rid into the country , some where or other ; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday , on purpose to get the better of it . And after thinking it all over and over again , he said , it seemed to him as if , now he had no fortune , and no nothing at all , it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement , because it must be for her loss , for he had nothing but two thousand pounds , and no hope of any thing else ; and if he was to go into orders , as he had some thoughts , he could get nothing but a curacy , and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear to think of her doing no better , and so he begged , if she had the least mind for it , to put an end to the matter directly , and leave him shift for himself . I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be . And it was entirely for HER sake , and upon HER account , that he said a word about being off , and not upon his own . I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her , or of wishing to marry Miss Morton , or any thing like it . But , to be sure , Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking ; so she told him directly ( with a great deal about sweet and love , you know , and all that -- Oh , la ! one ca n't repeat such kind of things you know)--she told him directly , she had not the least mind in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind . So then he was monstrous happy , and talked on some time about what they should do , and they agreed he should take orders directly , and they must wait to be married till he got a living . And just then I could not hear any more , for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach , and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens ; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them , to ask Lucy if she would like to go , but she did not care to leave Edward ; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons . \" \" I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them , \" said Elinor ; \" you were all in the same room together , were not you ? \" \" No , indeed , not us . La ! Miss Dashwood , do you think people make love when any body else is by ? Oh , for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that . ( Laughing affectedly.) --No , no ; they were shut up in the drawing - room together , and all I heard was only by listening at the door . \" \" How ! \" cried Elinor ; \" have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ? I am sorry I did not know it before ; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself . How could you behave so unfairly by your sister ? \" \" Oh , la ! there is nothing in THAT . I only stood at the door , and heard what I could . And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said . \" Elinor tried to talk of something else ; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind . \" Edward talks of going to Oxford soon , \" said she ; \" but now he is lodging at No . -- , Pall Mall . What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an't she ? And your brother and sister were not very kind ! However , I sha n't say anything against them to YOU ; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot , which was more than I looked for . And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight . Edward have got some business at Oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after THAT , as soon as he can light upon a Bishop , he will be ordained . I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious ! ( giggling as she spoke ) I 'd lay my life I know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it . They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living . I know they will ; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- ' La ! ' I shall say directly , ' I wonder how you could think of such a thing ? I write to the Doctor , indeed ! ' \" \" Well , \" said Elinor , \" it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst . You have got your answer ready . \" Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject , but the approach of her own party made another more necessary . \" Oh , la ! here come the Richardsons . I had a vast deal more to say to you , but I must not stay away from them not any longer . I assure you they are very genteel people . He makes a monstrous deal of money , and they keep their own coach . I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here . Remember me kindly to her . La ! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn . \" Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind . Edward 's marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain , as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance . As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs. Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known . The continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark . \" Wait for his having a living!--ay , we all know how THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.--Then they will have a child every year ! and Lord help 'em ! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house . Two maids and two men , indeed!--as I talked of t'other day.--No , no , they must get a stout girl of all works.-- Betty 's sister would never do for them NOW . \" The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two - penny post from Lucy herself . It was as follows : \" Bartlett 's Building , March . \" I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another 's love . We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it . I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings wo n't think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne , \" I am , & c. \" As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer 's real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise . \" Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would . That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul ! I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart.--She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings , you see . She is a good - hearted girl as ever lived.--Very well upon my word . That sentence is very prettily turned . Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough . How attentive she is , to think of every body!--Thank you , my dear , for shewing it me . It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy 's head and heart great credit . \" 39 The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne 's impatience to be gone increased every day . She sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , Barton must do it . Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March , for the Easter holidays ; and Mrs. Jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them . This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure . When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious . \" Cleveland!\" --she cried , with great agitation . \" No , I can not go to Cleveland . \"-- \" You forget , \" said Elinor gently , \" that its situation is not ... that it is not in the neighbourhood of ... \" \" But it is in Somersetshire.--I can not go into Somersetshire.--There , where I looked forward to going ... No , Elinor , you can not expect me to go there . \" Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;--represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day 's journey ; and their mother 's servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ' time . As Marianne 's affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started . Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland . Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother 's concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . \" Ah ! Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods;\"--was Mrs. Jennings 's address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled--\"for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back!--Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats . \" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . This set the matter beyond a doubt . She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest . They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne 's performance brought her these words in the Colonel 's calm voice,-- \" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . \" Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , \" Lord ! what should hinder it?\" --but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . \" This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older . \" This delay on the Colonel 's side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said , \" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you . \" Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . \" I have heard , \" said he , with great compassion , \" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- \" Elinor told him that it was . \" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied , with great feeling,--\"of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to . I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more . I understand that he intends to take orders . Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day 's post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable.-- It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income . Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting him to it , will be very great . Pray assure him of it . \" Elinor 's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater , had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand . The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry;-- and SHE , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed . She thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of Edward 's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another . But at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself . It was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER , she would have been very glad to be spared herself;-- but Colonel Brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition . Edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele . She could undertake therefore to inform him of it , in the course of the day . After this had been settled , Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor , as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size . \" The smallness of the house , \" said she , \" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . \" By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr. Ferrars 's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on-- and he said so . \" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon.-- \" Such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Mrs.
