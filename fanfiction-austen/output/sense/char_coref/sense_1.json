{"document": "2 Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland ; and her mother and sisters - in - law were degraded to the condition of visitors . As such , however , they were treated by her with quiet civility ; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself , his wife , and their child . He really pressed them , with some earnestness , to consider Norland as their home ; and , as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood , his invitation was accepted . A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight , was exactly what suited her mind . In seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself . But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy . Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters . To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree . She begged him to think again on the subject . How could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ? And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount . It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why was he to ruin himself , and their poor little Harry , by giving away all his money to his half sisters ? \" It was my father 's last request to me , \" replied her husband , \" that I should assist his widow and daughters . \" \" He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time . Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . \" \" He did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear Fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . He could hardly suppose I should neglect them . But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time . The promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home . \" \" Well , then , LET something be done for them ; but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds . Consider , \" she added , \" that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . Your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . If , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy-- \" \" Why , to be sure , \" said her husband , very gravely , \" that would make great difference . The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . \" \" To be sure it would . \" \" Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! \" \" Oh ! beyond anything great ! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if REALLY his sisters ! And as it is -- only half blood!--But you have such a generous spirit ! \" \" I would not wish to do any thing mean , \" he replied . \" One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . \" \" There is no knowing what THEY may expect , \" said the lady , \" but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do . \" \" Certainly -- and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . As it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother 's death -- a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . \" \" To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds . \" \" That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable . \" His wife hesitated a little , however , in giving her consent to this plan . \" To be sure , \" said she , \" it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . But , then , if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in . \" \" Fifteen years ! my dear Fanny ; her life can not be worth half that purchase . \" \" Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . You are not aware of what you are doing . I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father 's will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . My mother was quite sick of it . Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother 's disposal , without any restriction whatever . It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . \" \" It is certainly an unpleasant thing , \" replied Mr. Dashwood , \" to have those kind of yearly drains on one 's income . One 's fortune , as your mother justly says , is NOT one 's own . To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one 's independence . \" \" Undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . They think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . If I were you , whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely . I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . \" \" I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should by no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . It will certainly be much the best way . A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . \" \" To be sure it will . Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . The assistance he thought of , I dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . I 'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did . Do but consider , my dear Mr. Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that?--They will live so cheap ! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all . They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! Only conceive how comfortable they will be ! Five hundred a year ! I am sure I can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . They will be much more able to give YOU something . \" \" Upon my word , \" said Mr. Dashwood , \" I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can . Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . \" \" Certainly , \" returned Mrs. John Dashwood . \" But , however , ONE thing must be considered . When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . \" \" That is a material consideration undoubtedly . A valuable legacy indeed ! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here . \" \" Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place THEY can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is . Your father thought only of THEM . And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM . \" This argument was irresistible . It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before ; and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out . 3 Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible . But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved . Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections . She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in affluence . For their brother 's sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before , in believing him incapable of generosity . His attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him , and , for a long time , she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions . The contempt which she had , very early in their acquaintance , felt for her daughter - in - law , was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character , which half a year 's residence in her family afforded ; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former , the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long , had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility , according to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood , to her daughters ' continuance at Norland . This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood , a gentleman - like and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister 's establishment at Norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there . Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest , for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich ; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence , for , except a trifling sum , the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother . But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration . It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality . It was contrary to every doctrine of her 's that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition ; and that Elinor 's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her , was to her comprehension impossible . Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address . He was not handsome , and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing . He was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart . His understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement . But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished -- as -- they hardly knew what . They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other . His mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day . Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche . But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches . All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life . Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising . Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood 's attention ; for she was , at that time , in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects . She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive , and she liked him for it . He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill - timed conversation . She was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister . It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother . \" It is enough , \" said she ; \" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough . It implies everything amiable . I love him already . \" \" I think you will like him , \" said Elinor , \" when you know more of him . \" \" Like him ! \" replied her mother with a smile . \" I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . \" \" You may esteem him . \" \" I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . \" Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him . Her manners were attaching , and soon banished his reserve . She speedily comprehended all his merits ; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration ; but she really felt assured of his worth : and even that quietness of manner , which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man 's address ought to be , was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate . No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor , than she considered their serious attachment as certain , and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching . \" In a few months , my dear Marianne . \" said she , \" Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . We shall miss her ; but SHE will be happy . \" \" Oh ! Mamma , how shall we do without her ? \" \" My love , it will be scarcely a separation . We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward 's heart . But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister 's choice ? \" \" Perhaps , \" said Marianne , \" I may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mamma , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference!\" -- \" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you WOULD give him Cowper . \" \" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper!-- but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love . I require so much ! He must have all Edward 's virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . \" \" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from her 's ! \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 4], "text": "Mrs. John Dashwood"}, {"position": [6, 7], "text":
