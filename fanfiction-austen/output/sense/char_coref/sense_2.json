{"document": "4 \" What a pity it is , Elinor , \" said Marianne , \" that Edward should have no taste for drawing . \" \" No taste for drawing ! \" replied Elinor , \" why should you think so ? He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . \" Marianne was afraid of offending , and said no more on the subject ; but the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people , was very far from that rapturous delight , which , in her opinion , could alone be called taste . Yet , though smiling within herself at the mistake , she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it . \" I hope , Marianne , \" continued Elinor , \" you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if THAT were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him . \" Marianne hardly knew what to say . She would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account , and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible . At length she replied : \" Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . \" \" I am sure , \" replied Elinor , with a smile , \" that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . \" Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased . \" Of his sense and his goodness , \" continued Elinor , \" no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ? \" \" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now . When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . \" Elinor started at this declaration , and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into , in speaking of him . She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion . She believed the regard to be mutual ; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne 's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her . She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment , they believed the next -- that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect . She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister . \" I do not attempt to deny , \" said she , \" that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him . \" Marianne here burst forth with indignation-- \" Esteem him ! Like him ! Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment . \" Elinor could not help laughing . \" Excuse me , \" said she ; \" and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . \" Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth . \" And you really are not engaged to him ! \" said she . \" Yet it certainly soon will happen . But two advantages will proceed from this delay . I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! \" Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister . She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it . There was , at times , a want of spirits about him which , if it did not denote indifference , spoke of something almost as unpromising . A doubt of her regard , supposing him to feel it , need not give him more than inquietude . It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him . A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection . She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present , nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself , without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement . With such a knowledge as this , it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject . She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her , which her mother and sister still considered as certain . Nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship . But , whatever might really be its limits , it was enough , when perceived by his sister , to make her uneasy , and at the same time , ( which was still more common , ) to make her uncivil . She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother - in - law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother 's great expectations , of Mrs. Ferrars 's resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN ; that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm . She gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations . In this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire . The letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation . He understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her . He earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to Barton Park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether Barton Cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her . He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections . She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry . Her resolution was formed as she read . The situation of Barton , in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire , which , but a few hours before , would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place , was now its first recommendation . To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil ; it was an object of desire ; it was a blessing , in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter - in - law 's guest ; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress . She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent . Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance . On THAT head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother 's intention of removing into Devonshire . The house , too , as described by Sir John , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence . 5 No sooner was her answer dispatched , than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . They heard her with surprise . Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland . She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , \" Devonshire ! Are you , indeed , going there ? So far from hence ! And to what part of it ? \" She explained the situation . It was within four miles northward of Exeter . \" It is but a cottage , \" she continued , \" but I hope to see many of my friends in it . A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . \" She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton ; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection . Though her late conversation with her daughter - in - law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended . To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match . Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water . It chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne 's . Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood 's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture . Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession . No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . For the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed . HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland . The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own . Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter - in - law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure . Now was the time when her son - in - law 's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled . Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment . But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland . He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton 's first letter to Norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . \" Dear , dear Norland ! \" said Marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; \" when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you , ye well - known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!--No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you ?
