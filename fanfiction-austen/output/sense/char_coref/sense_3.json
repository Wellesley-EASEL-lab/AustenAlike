{"document": "6 The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant . But as they drew towards the end of it , their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection , and a view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness . It was a pleasant fertile spot , well wooded , and rich in pasture . After winding along it for more than a mile , they reached their own house . A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front ; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it . As a house , Barton Cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles . A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind . On each side of the entrance was a sitting room , about sixteen feet square ; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs . Four bed - rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house . It had not been built many years and was in good repair . In comparison of Norland , it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away . They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy . It was very early in September ; the season was fine , and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather , they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation . The situation of the house was good . High hills rose immediately behind , and at no great distance on each side ; some of which were open downs , the others cultivated and woody . The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows . The prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond . The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them . With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments . \" As for the house itself , to be sure , \" said she , \" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building . These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . I could wish the stairs were handsome . But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . \" In the mean time , till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a - year by a woman who never saved in her life , they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was ; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . Marianne 's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and Elinor 's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room . In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to Barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty . He had formerly visited at Stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . His countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . Their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence . His kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game . He insisted , moreover , on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them , and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day . Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him , denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience ; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite , her ladyship was introduced to them the next day . They were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes . Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty ; her face was handsome , her figure tall and striking , and her address graceful . Her manners had all the elegance which her husband 's wanted . But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by shewing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark . Conversation however was not wanted , for Sir John was very chatty , and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home . On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others . An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day . 7 Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage . The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill . The house was large and handsome ; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . The former was for Sir John 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady . They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood . It was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass . Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother . He hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources . Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while Sir John 's independent employments were in existence only half the time . Continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of Sir John , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife . Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties . But Sir John 's satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased . He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen . The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton . The Miss Dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected . It was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person . The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor . Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John , who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . They would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay . He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again . He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements . Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave . His appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike . There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother - in - law was interesting . Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves . In the evening , as Marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . The instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and Marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother 's account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it . Marianne 's performance was highly applauded . Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one 's attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished . Colonel Brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures . He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste . His pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment . She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel 's advanced state of life which humanity required .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [260, 261], "text": "They"},
