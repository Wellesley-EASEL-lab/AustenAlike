{"document": "II No misfortune occurred , again to prevent the ball . The day approached , the day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious watching , Frank Churchill , in all the certainty of his own self , reached Randalls before dinner , and every thing was safe . No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma . The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd . Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man 's company . She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them . Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch ; and though he did not say much , his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening . They all walked about together , to see that every thing was as it should be ; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage , which Emma could not hear the sound of at first , without great surprize . \" So unreasonably early ! \" she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr. Weston 's judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection . Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity . She liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be.-- She could fancy such a man . The whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _ May _ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant . Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston 's fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger . They had stopped at Mrs. Bates 's door to offer the use of their carriage , but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons . Frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease . He was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages,-- impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her . Mrs. Elton was spoken of . \" I think she must be here soon , \" said he . \" I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton , I have heard so much of her . It can not be long , I think , before she comes . \" A carriage was heard . He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said , \" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her . I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton . I have no business to put myself forward . \" Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed . \" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! \" said Mr. Weston , looking about . \" We thought you were to bring them . \" The mistake had been slight . The carriage was sent for them now . Emma longed to know what Frank 's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be ; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress , and her smiles of graciousness . He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion , by giving her very proper attention , after the introduction had passed . In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.-- \" I will see that there are umbrellas , sir , \" said Frank to his father : \" Miss Bates must not be forgotten : \" and away he went . Mr. Weston was following ; but Mrs. Elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing . \" A very fine young man indeed , Mr. Weston . You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me . I never compliment . I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve -- so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism . You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies-- quite a horror of them . They were never tolerated at Maple Grove . Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things ! Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better . \" While she talked of his son , Mr. Weston 's attention was chained ; but when she got to Maple Grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away . Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston . \" I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane . Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.-- What a pleasure it is to send one 's carriage for a friend!-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . You may be very sure I shall always take care of _ them _ . \" Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston 's to receive them . Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma ; but her words , every body 's words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire . As the door opened she was heard , \" So very obliging of you!--No rain at all . Nothing to signify . I do not care for myself . Quite thick shoes . And Jane declares-- Well!--(as soon as she was within the door ) Well ! This is brilliant indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived , upon my word . Nothing wanting . Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!-- Jane , Jane , look!--did you ever see any thing ? Oh ! Mr. Weston , you must really have had Aladdin 's lamp . Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again . I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ` Oh ! Mrs. Stokes , ' said I-- but I had not time for more . \" She was now met by Mrs. Weston.-- \" Very well , I thank you , ma'am . I hope you are quite well . Very happy to hear it . So afraid you might have a headache!-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . Delighted to hear it indeed . Ah ! dear Mrs. Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent time . Jane and I quite ready . Did not keep the horses a moment . Most comfortable carriage.-- Oh ! and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs. Weston , on that score . Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been.-- But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours . I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma'am-- . ' Thank you , my mother is remarkably well . Gone to Mr. Woodhouse 's . I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon 's wedding - present.--So kind of her to think of my mother ! Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr. Dixon 's choice . There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time . Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive . My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh ! Mr. Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother 's spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again . My mother often talks of your good - nature . Does not she , Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- Ah ! here 's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do?-- Very well I thank you , quite well . This is meeting quite in fairy - land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane 's hair?--You are a judge.-- She did it all herself . Quite wonderful how she does her hair!-- No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah ! Dr. Hughes I declare-- and Mrs. Hughes . Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How do you do ? How do you do?--Very well , I thank you . This is delightful , is not it?--Where 's dear Mr. Richard?-- Oh ! there he is . Do n't disturb him . Much better employed talking to the young ladies . How do you do , Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs. Otway , I protest!-- and good Mr. Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do ? How do you all do?--Quite well , I am much obliged to you . Never better.-- Do n't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends ! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted . No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee.--A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,--no hurry -- Oh ! here it comes . Every thing so good ! \" Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful . Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine . After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself-- and it was , \" How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- How has Wright done my hair?\" --with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness . Mrs. Elton then said , \" Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body 's eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons -- who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- I would not wish to be inferior to others . And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand.--We shall see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill . I like him very well . \" At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously , that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , and did not want to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while , till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton 's tones again distinctly forward.--Mr . Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming , \" Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us . \" \" Jane!\" --repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure.-- \" That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . \" \" How do you like Mrs. Elton ? \" said Emma in a whisper . \" Not at all . \" \" You are ungrateful . \" \" Ungrateful!--What do you mean ? \" Then changing from a frown to a smile--\"No , do not tell me -- I do not want to know what you mean.-- Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing ? \" Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour . He walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both Mr. and Mrs. Weston . He had met with them in a little perplexity , which must be laid before Emma . It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude . \" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? \" said Mr. Weston . \" She will think Frank ought to ask her . \" Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _ him _ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way , Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . It was almost enough to make her think of marrying . Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change . Mr. Weston might be his son 's superior.-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body 's eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid . There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner . They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable . The ball proceeded pleasantly . The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston , were not thrown away . Every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this . Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . There was one , however , which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma 's wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about . He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room . Escape , however , was not his plan . He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it . He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her.-- Emma saw it . She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all . When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr. Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind - hearted , gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say , \" Do not you dance , Mr. Elton ? \" to which his prompt reply was , \" Most readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with me . \" \" Me!--oh ! no -- I would get you a better partner than myself . I am no dancer . \" \" If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance , \" said he , \" I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert . \" \" Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith . \" \" Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging-- and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over , Mrs. Weston . You will excuse me . Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over . \" Mrs. Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat . This was Mr. Elton ! the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr. Elton.-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife . She would not look again . Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot . In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again . His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced . It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles . Mr. Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish . She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her;--_she _ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner , \" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured , I declare . \" Supper was announced . The move began ; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon . \" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you?--Here is your tippet . Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet . She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done -- One door nailed up -- Quantities of matting -- My dear Jane , indeed you must . Mr. Churchill , oh ! you are too obliging ! How well you put it on!--so gratified ! Excellent dancing indeed!-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word , just as I told you . Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr. Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr. William Cox . ' My dear sir , you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am not helpless . Sir , you are most kind . Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other!--Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs. Elton is going ; dear Mrs. Elton , how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train . Quite the queen of the evening!--Well , here we are at the passage . Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps . Oh ! no , there is but one . Well , I was persuaded there were two . How very odd ! I was convinced there were two , and there is but one . I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane,--There was a little disappointment.-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr. Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again . Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus-- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned!--Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement ! could not have supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since-- Well , where shall we sit ? where shall we sit ? Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught . Where _ I _ sit is of no consequence . Oh ! do you recommend this side?--Well , I am sure , Mr. Churchill-- only it seems too good -- but just as you please . What you direct in this house can not be wrong . Dear Jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ? Soup too ! Bless me ! I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I can not help beginning . \" Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked . He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton 's conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs. Elton 's looks also received the due share of censure . \" They aimed at wounding more than Harriet , \" said he . \" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ? \" He looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , \" _ She _ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be.--To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet . \" \" I did , \" replied Emma , \" and they can not forgive me . \" He shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said , \" I shall not scold you . I leave you to your own reflections . \" \" Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ? \" \" Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it . \" \" I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton . There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet . It was through a series of strange blunders ! \" \" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without . An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl-- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton . I found Harriet more conversable than I expected . \" Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again . \" Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing?-- Come Emma , set your companions the example . Every body is lazy ! Every body is asleep ! \" \" I am ready , \" said Emma , \" whenever I am wanted . \" \" Whom are you going to dance with ? \" asked Mr. Knightley . She hesitated a moment , and then replied , \" With you , if you will ask me . \" \" Will you ? \" said he , offering his hand . \" Indeed I will . You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper . \" \" Brother and sister ! no , indeed . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions":
