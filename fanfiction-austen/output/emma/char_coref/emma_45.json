{"document": "IX Emma 's pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her . Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father.--Mr . Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said , \" I would not go away without seeing you , but I have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly . I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella . Have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love , ' which nobody carries ? \" \" Nothing at all . But is not this a sudden scheme ? \" \" Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time . \" Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going-- her father began his inquiries . \" Well , my dear , and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming . Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates , Mr. Knightley , as I told you before . She is always so attentive to them ! \" Emma 's colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr. Knightley.-- It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from her 's , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.-- He looked at her with a glow of regard . She was warmly gratified-- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say-- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips-- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive.--He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped.--The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more.-- It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature.-- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction . It spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards-- gone in a moment . He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance . Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax 's situation with Mr. Knightley.-- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found . It was a pity that she had not come back earlier ! In the hope of diverting her father 's thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley 's going to London ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check,-- interested , without disturbing him . He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax 's going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr. Knightley 's going to London had been an unexpected blow . \" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled . Mrs. Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be . I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of . It ought to be a first object , as I am sure poor Miss Taylor 's always was with me . You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us . And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long . \" The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background . An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill ! Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return . A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle . The great Mrs. Churchill was no more . It was felt as such things must be felt . Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried . Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame . Mrs. Churchill , after being disliked at least twenty - five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances . In one point she was fully justified . She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill . The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints . \" Poor Mrs. Churchill ! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper . It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr. Churchill do without her ? Mr. Churchill 's loss would be dreadful indeed . Mr. Churchill would never get over it . \" -- Even Mr. Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , \" Ah ! poor woman , who would have thought it ! \" and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady . How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was also a very early speculation with Emma . The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . She saw in a moment all the possible good . Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter . Mr. Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. Churchill 's death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma 's side . It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet 's opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it . The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message . \" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ; \" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge 's at the time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged-- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . Her spirits seemed overcome . Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:-- confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise-- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . The answer was only in this short note : \" Miss Fairfax 's compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise . \" Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates 's , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her-- but it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried-- but all in vain . Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in . \" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all-- Mrs. Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs. Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs. Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody . \" Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note . In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but \" dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing . \" When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together-- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _ her _ . She was sorry , very sorry . Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .",
