{"document": "VIII Frank Churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father 's dinner waiting , it was not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed . He came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done . He had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits . He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself:-- \" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it . Mr. Knightley , he is _ not _ a trifling , silly young man . If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.--No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . \" With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time . She meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole 's ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole . Her father 's comfort was amply secured , Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it . She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole 's door ; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley 's ; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in Emma 's opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey . She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out . \" This is coming as you should do , \" said she ; \" like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you . \" He thanked her , observing , \" How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner . \" \" Yes I should , I am sure I should . There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them . You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances . _ Now _ you have nothing to try for . You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . You are not striving to look taller than any body else . _ Now _ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you . \" \" Nonsensical girl ! \" was his reply , but not at all in anger . Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr. Knightley . She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for . When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side . The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr. Cox 's family , the lawyer of Highbury . The less worthy females were to come in the evening , with Miss Bates , Miss Fairfax , and Miss Smith ; but already , at dinner , they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general ; and , while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over , Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour . The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax . Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting . She listened , and found it well worth listening to . That very dear part of Emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply . Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates 's , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood 's the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates 's account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it-- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell . \" One can suppose nothing else , \" added Mrs. Cole , \" and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt . But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . They might chuse to surprize her . \" Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way , and still listen to Mrs. Cole . \" I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought-- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening . \" Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole 's , turned to Frank Churchill . \" Why do you smile ? \" said she . \" Nay , why do you ? \" \" Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell 's being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present . \" \" Very . \" \" I rather wonder that it was never made before . \" \" Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . \" \" Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument-- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body . \" \" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates 's house . \" \" You may _ say _ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _ thoughts _ on this subject are very much like mine . \" \" I do not know . I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve . I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question . If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ? \" \" What do you say to Mrs. Dixon ? \" \" Mrs. Dixon ! very true indeed . I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon . She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman 's scheme than an elderly man 's . It is Mrs. Dixon , I dare say . I told you that your suspicions would guide mine . \" \" If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _ Mr _ . Dixon in them . \" \" Mr. Dixon.--Very well . Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . \" \" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _ her _ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland . Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body 's native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her 's . I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are . \" \" And , upon my word , they have an air of great probability . Mr. Dixon 's preference of her music to her friend 's , I can answer for being very decided . \" \" And then , he saved her life . Did you ever hear of that?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard . He caught her . \" \" He did . I was there -- one of the party . \" \" Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries . \" \" I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.--It was the work of a moment . And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again-- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable . I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries . \" The conversation was here interrupted . They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , Emma said , \" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough . Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . \" \" And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells . \" \" No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells . Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first . She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them . I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business . \" \" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . \" There was no occasion to press the matter farther . The conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it . She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes . The ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived . Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection . There she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ? To be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour . Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend . In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her . She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of \" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . \" Mrs. Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine 's countenance . They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill . In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all . Emma divined what every body present must be thinking . She was his object , and every body must perceive it . She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other . \" He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete . \" And she , \" Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . \" Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence . Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech . He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room-- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could-- that his father , Mr. Knightley , Mr. Cox , and Mr. Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families-- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much . She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire-- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _ at _ _ times _ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night . She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked . His importance at Enscombe was very evident . He did not boast , but it naturally betrayed itself , that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing , and on her laughing and noticing it , he owned that he believed ( excepting one or two points ) he could _ with _ _ time _ persuade her to any thing . One of those points on which his influence failed , he then mentioned . He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it . This had happened the year before . _ Now _ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish . The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father . \" I have made a most wretched discovery , \" said he , after a short pause.-- \" I have been here a week to - morrow -- half my time . I never knew days fly so fast . A week to - morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston , and others!-- I hate the recollection . \" \" Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut . \" \" No , \" said he , smiling , \" that is no subject of regret at all . I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . \" The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr. Cole . When Mr. Cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite . \" What is the matter ? \" said she . He started . \" Thank you for rousing me , \" he replied . \" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I can not keep my eyes from her . I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own . I see nobody else looking like her!-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion . Shall I?-- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it;-- whether she colours . \" He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing . Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs. Weston . \" This is the luxury of a large party , \" said she:--\"one can get near every body , and say every thing . My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you . I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh . Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ? \" \" How?--They were invited , were not they ? \" \" Oh ! yes -- but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming ? \" \" They walked , I conclude . How else could they come ? \" \" Very true.--Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . Poor girl ! I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage . You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once . Good soul ! she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . ` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!' --but with many , many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr. Knightley 's carriage had brought , and was to take them home again . ' I was quite surprized;--very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention!-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of . And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them . \" \" Very likely , \" said Emma--\"nothing more likely . I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax 's ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley . I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray . \" \" Well , \" said Mrs. Weston , smiling , \" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears . In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax . See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to it ? \" \" Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! \" exclaimed Emma . \" Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?--Mr . Knightley!--Mr . Knightley must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?-- Oh ! no , no , Henry must have Donwell . I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley 's marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely . I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . \" \" My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry-- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry 's account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ? \" \" Yes , I would . I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- Mr. Knightley marry!--No , I have never had such an idea , and I can not adopt it now . And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women ! \" \" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know . \" \" But the imprudence of such a match ! \" \" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability . \" \" I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax-- and is always glad to shew them attention . My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making . You do it very ill . Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh ! no , no;--every feeling revolts . For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing . \" \" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable . \" \" But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry . I am sure he has not the least idea of it . Do not put it into his head . Why should he marry?-- He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother 's children . He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart . \" \" My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax-- \" \" Nonsense ! He does not care about Jane Fairfax . In the way of love , I am sure he does not . He would do any good to her , or her family ; but-- \" \" Well , \" said Mrs. Weston , laughing , \" perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home . \" \" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?-- ` So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour ! ' And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother 's old petticoat . ` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . ' \" \" For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates . Little things do not irritate him . She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice . But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does . I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax ! The interest he takes in her-- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice ! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh ! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody-- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley ? I can not help suspecting him . I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love . \" \" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously . \" \" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him . \" \" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . \" \" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him . I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner . \" \" You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment-- I believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . \" They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation;-- and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it . Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance . She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well . One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second , slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill . Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed . He was accused of having a delightful voice , and a perfect knowledge of music ; which was properly denied ; and that he knew nothing of the matter , and had no voice at all , roundly asserted . They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own . With mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen . Frank Churchill sang again . They had sung together once or twice , it appeared , at Weymouth . But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma 's mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston 's suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions . Her objections to Mr. Knightley 's marrying did not in the least subside . She could see nothing but evil in it . It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley ; consequently to Isabella . A real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her father 's daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey . A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to!--No -- Mr. Knightley must never marry . Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell . Presently Mr. Knightley looked back , and came and sat down by her . They talked at first only of the performance . His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs. Weston , it would not have struck her . As a sort of touchstone , however , she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece ; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short , she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own . \" I often feel concern , \" said she , \" that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose . \" \" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question , \" he replied;-- \" but you must often wish it , I am sure . \" And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step . \" This present from the Campbells , \" said she--\"this pianoforte is very kindly given . \" \" Yes , \" he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.-- \" But they would have done better had they given her notice of it . Surprizes are foolish things . The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable . I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell . \" From that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument . But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful . Towards the end of Jane 's second song , her voice grew thick . \" That will do , \" said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud-- \" you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet . \" Another song , however , was soon begged for . \" One more;--they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more . \" And Frank Churchill was heard to say , \" I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling . The strength of the song falls on the second . \" Mr. Knightley grew angry . \" That fellow , \" said he , indignantly , \" thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . This must not be . \" And touching Miss Bates , who at that moment passed near--\"Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ? Go , and interfere . They have no mercy on her . \" Miss Bates , in her real anxiety for Jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing . Here ceased the concert part of the evening , for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing-- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space . Mrs. Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top . While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr. Knightley . This would be a trial . He was no dancer in general . If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now , it might augur something . There was no immediate appearance . No ; he was talking to Mrs. Cole-- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole . Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment . Not more than five couple could be mustered ; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful , and she found herself well matched in a partner . They were a couple worth looking at . Two dances , unfortunately , were all that could be allowed . It was growing late , and Miss Bates became anxious to get home , on her mother 's account . After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston , look sorrowful , and have done . \" Perhaps it is as well , \" said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage . \" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your 's . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text":
