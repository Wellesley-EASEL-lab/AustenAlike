{"document": "VII They had a very fine day for Box Hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour of a pleasant party . Mr. Weston directed the whole , officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage , and every body was in good time . Emma and Harriet went together ; Miss Bates and her niece , with the Eltons ; the gentlemen on horseback . Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse . Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there . Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment , and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving ; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency . There was a languor , a want of spirits , a want of union , which could not be got over . They separated too much into parties . The Eltons walked together ; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill . And Mr. Weston tried , in vain , to make them harmonise better . It seemed at first an accidental division , but it never materially varied . Mr. and Mrs. Elton , indeed , shewed no unwillingness to mix , and be as agreeable as they could ; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill , there seemed a principle of separation , between the other parties , too strong for any fine prospects , or any cold collation , or any cheerful Mr. Weston , to remove . At first it was downright dulness to Emma . She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid . He said nothing worth hearing-- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said . While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable . When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object . Every distinguishing attention that could be paid , was paid to her . To amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and Emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe . \" Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively . \" They were laying themselves open to that very phrase -- and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady , to Ireland by another . Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected . She laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart . She still intended him for her friend . \" How much I am obliged to you , \" said he , \" for telling me to come to - day!-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . I had quite determined to go away again . \" \" Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries . I was a kinder friend than you deserved . But you were humble . You begged hard to be commanded to come . \" \" Do n't say I was cross . I was fatigued . The heat overcame me . \" \" It is hotter to - day . \" \" Not to my feelings . I am perfectly comfortable to - day . \" \" You are comfortable because you are under command . \" \" Your command?--Yes . \" \" Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self - command . You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I can not be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine . \" \" It comes to the same thing . I can have no self - command without a motive . You order me , whether you speak or not . And you can be always with me . You are always with me . \" \" Dating from three o'clock yesterday . My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before . \" \" Three o'clock yesterday ! That is your date . I thought I had seen you first in February . \" \" Your gallantry is really unanswerable . But ( lowering her voice)-- nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people . \" \" I say nothing of which I am ashamed , \" replied he , with lively impudence . \" I saw you first in February . Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can . Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side , and Dorking on the other . I saw you first in February . \" And then whispering-- \" Our companions are excessively stupid . What shall we do to rouse them ? Any nonsense will serve . They _ shall _ talk . Ladies and gentlemen , I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ? \" Some laughed , and answered good - humouredly . Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse 's presiding ; Mr. Knightley 's answer was the most distinct . \" Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ? \" \" Oh ! no , no\"--cried Emma , laughing as carelessly as she could-- \" Upon no account in the world . It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now . Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . I will not say quite all . There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing . \" \" It is a sort of thing , \" cried Mrs. Elton emphatically , \" which _ I _ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . Though , perhaps , as the _ Chaperon _ of the party-- _ I _ never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women-- \" Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply , \" Very true , my love , very true . Exactly so , indeed -- quite unheard of-- but some ladies say any thing . Better pass it off as a joke . Every body knows what is due to _ you _ . \" \" It will not do , \" whispered Frank to Emma ; \" they are most of them affronted . I will attack them with more address . Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way . Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already , ) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever-- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all . \" \" Oh ! very well , \" exclaimed Miss Bates , \" then I need not be uneasy . ` Three things very dull indeed . ' That will just do for me , you know . I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth , sha n't I ? ( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body 's assent)--Do not you all think I shall ? \" Emma could not resist . \" Ah ! ma'am , but there may be a difficulty . Pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once . \" Miss Bates , deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner , did not immediately catch her meaning ; but , when it burst on her , it could not anger , though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her . \" Ah!--well -- to be sure . Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) and I will try to hold my tongue . I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend . \" \" I like your plan , \" cried Mr. Weston . \" Agreed , agreed . I will do my best . I am making a conundrum . How will a conundrum reckon ? \" \" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low , \" answered his son;--\"but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way . \" \" No , no , \" said Emma , \" it will not reckon low . A conundrum of Mr. Weston 's shall clear him and his next neighbour . Come , sir , pray let me hear it . \" \" I doubt its being very clever myself , \" said Mr. Weston . \" It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ? \" \" What two letters!--express perfection ! I am sure I do not know . \" \" Ah ! you will never guess . You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em - ma.--Do you understand ? \" Understanding and gratification came together . It might be a very indifferent piece of wit , but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and Mr. Knightley gravely said , \" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _ Perfection _ should not have come quite so soon . \" \" Oh ! for myself , I protest I must be excused , \" said Mrs. Elton ; \" _ I _ really can not attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing . I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with . I knew who it came from . An abominable puppy!-- You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband ) . These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer . Miss Woodhouse must excuse me . I am not one of those who have witty things at every body 's service . I do not pretend to be a wit . I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . Pass us , if you please , Mr. Churchill . Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself . We have nothing clever to say-- not one of us . \" Yes , yes , pray pass _ me _ , \" added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; \" _ I _ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady . An old married man-- quite good for nothing . Shall we walk , Augusta ? \" \" With all my heart . I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot . Come , Jane , take my other arm . \" Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off . \" Happy couple ! \" said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing:--\"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath ! Peculiarly lucky!-- for as to any real knowledge of a person 's disposition that Bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge . It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . Short of that , it is all guess and luck-- and will generally be ill - luck . How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life ! \" Miss Fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now . \" Such things do occur , undoubtedly . \"--She was stopped by a cough . Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen . \" You were speaking , \" said he , gravely . She recovered her voice . \" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I can not imagine them to be very frequent . A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise-- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards . I would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance , ) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever . \" He made no answer ; merely looked , and bowed in submission ; and soon afterwards said , in a lively tone , \" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me . Will you ? ( turning to Emma . ) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you . You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ) . Find some body for me . I am in no hurry . Adopt her , educate her . \" \" And make her like myself . \" \" By all means , if you can . \" \" Very well . I undertake the commission . You shall have a charming wife . \" \" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes . I care for nothing else . I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife . Remember . \" Emma was in no danger of forgetting . It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling . Would not Harriet be the very creature described ? Hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it . \" Now , ma'am , \" said Jane to her aunt , \" shall we join Mrs. Elton ? \" \" If you please , my dear . With all my heart . I am quite ready . I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well . We shall soon overtake her . There she is -- no , that 's somebody else . That 's one of the ladies in the Irish car party , not at all like her.-- Well , I declare-- \" They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley . Mr. Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man 's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant . Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _ her _ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure . Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again . While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr. Knightley by her side . He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , \" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it . I can not see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance . How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible . \" Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off . \" Nay , how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it . It was not so very bad . I dare say she did not understand me . \" \" I assure you she did . She felt your full meaning . She has talked of it since . I wish you could have heard how she talked of it-- with what candour and generosity . I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome . \" \" Oh ! \" cried Emma , \" I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her . \" \" They are blended , \" said he , \" I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good . Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner . Were she your equal in situation-- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case . She is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more . Her situation should secure your compassion . It was badly done , indeed ! You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _ some _ , ) would be entirely guided by _ your _ treatment of her.--This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will,--I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now . \" While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in . He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless . They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern . She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late . He had turned away , and the horses were in motion . She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind . She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal . Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life . She was most forcibly struck . The truth of this representation there was no denying . She felt it at her heart . How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates ! How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued ! And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness ! Time did not compose her . As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more . She never had been so depressed . Happily it was not necessary to speak . There was only Harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [61, 63], "text": "Miss Bates"}, {"position": [64, 65], "text": "her"}, {"position": [167, 169], "text":
