{"document": "[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ] VOLUME I I Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her . She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister 's marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period . Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection . Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse 's family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma . Between _ them _ it was more the intimacy of sisters . Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor 's judgment , but directed chiefly by her own . The real evils , indeed , of Emma 's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her . Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married . It was Miss Taylor 's loss which first brought grief . It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance . The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost . The event had every promise of happiness for her friend . Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning 's work for her . The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day . She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood . A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella 's marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault . How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . She dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her . He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful . The evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time . Her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again . Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals . The Woodhouses were first in consequence there . All looked up to them . She had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day . It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful . His spirits required support . He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind . Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter 's marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield . Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner , \" Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again . What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her ! \" \" I can not agree with you , papa ; you know I can not . Mr. Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? \" \" A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own ? This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours , my dear . \" \" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us!--We shall be always meeting ! _ We _ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon . \" \" My dear , how am I to get so far ? Randalls is such a distance . I could not walk half so far . \" \" No , papa , nobody thought of your walking . We must go in the carriage , to be sure . \" \" The carriage ! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ? \" \" They are to be put into Mr. Weston 's stable , papa . You know we have settled all that already . We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night . And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter 's being housemaid there . I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . That was your doing , papa . You got Hannah that good place . Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- James is so obliged to you ! \" \" I am very glad I did think of her . It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her . Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us . He will be able to tell her how we all are . \" Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own . The backgammon - table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary . Mr. Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella 's husband . He lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London . He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square . It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time . Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after \" poor Isabella \" and her children were answered most satisfactorily . When this was over , Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed , \" It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . \" \" Not at all , sir . It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire . \" \" But you must have found it very damp and dirty . I wish you may not catch cold . \" \" Dirty , sir ! Look at my shoes . Not a speck on them . \" \" Well ! that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here . It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding . \" \" By the bye -- I have not wished you joy . Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well . How did you all behave ? Who cried most ? \" \" Ah ! poor Miss Taylor ! ' Tis a sad business . \" \" Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I can not possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor . ' I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two . \" \" Especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! \" said Emma playfully . \" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by . \" \" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed , \" said Mr. Woodhouse , with a sigh . \" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome . \" \" My dearest papa ! You do not think I could mean _ you _ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _ you _ . What a horrible idea ! Oh no ! I meant only myself . Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know-- in a joke -- it is all a joke . We always say what we like to one another . \" Mr. Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body . \" Emma knows I never flatter her , \" said Mr. Knightley , \" but I meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . The chances are that she must be a gainer . \" \" Well , \" said Emma , willing to let it pass--\"you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day . \" \" Dear Emma bears every thing so well , \" said her father . \" But , Mr. Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _ will _ miss her more than she thinks for . \" Emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles . \" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion , \" said Mr. Knightley . \" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor 's advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor 's time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . \" \" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , \" said Emma , \" and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself . I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing . \" Mr. Knightley shook his head at her . Her father fondly replied , \" Ah ! my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . Pray do not make any more matches . \" \" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people . It is the greatest amusement in the world ! And after such success , you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again . Oh dear , no ! Mr. Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful-- Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it . Oh no ! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again . Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him . All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it . \" Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell 's , I made up my mind on the subject . I planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you can not think that I shall leave off match - making . \" \" I do not understand what you mean by ` success , ' \" said Mr. Knightley . \" Success supposes endeavour . Your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage . A worthy employment for a young lady 's mind ! But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her , ' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ? Where is your merit ? What are you proud of ? You made a lucky guess ; and _ that _ is all that can be said . \" \" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?-- I pity you.--I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck . There is always some talent in it . And as to my poor word ` success , ' which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it . You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all . If I had not promoted Mr. Weston 's visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all . I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that . \" \" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns . You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference . \" \" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others , \" rejoined Mr. Woodhouse , understanding but in part . \" But , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one 's family circle grievously . \" \" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr. Elton . Poor Mr. Elton ! You like Mr. Elton , papa,--I must look about for a wife for him . There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and I thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him ! I think very well of Mr. Elton , and this is the only way I have of doing him a service . \" \" Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him . But if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day . That will be a much better thing . I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him . \" \" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time , \" said Mr. Knightley , laughing , \" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife . Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [10, 12], "text": "Emma Woodhouse"},
