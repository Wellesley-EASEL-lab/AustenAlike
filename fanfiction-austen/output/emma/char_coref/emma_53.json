{"document": "XVII Mrs. Weston 's friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston . She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella 's sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best . It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston , as he grew older-- and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and Mrs. Weston-- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again . \" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me , \" she continued--\"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan . \" \" That is , \" replied Mr. Knightley , \" she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all . It will be the only difference . \" \" Poor child ! \" cried Emma ; \" at that rate , what will become of her ? \" \" Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands . She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma . I , who am owing all my happiness to _ you _ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ? \" Emma laughed , and replied : \" But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it . \" \" Do you?--I have no doubt . Nature gave you understanding:-- Miss Taylor gave you principles . You must have done well . My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . I do not believe I did you any good . The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least . \" \" I am sure you were of use to me , \" cried Emma . \" I was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than I would own at the time . I am very sure you did me good . And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . \" \" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks--`Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor 's leave'--something which , you knew , I did not approve . In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one . \" \" What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance . \" \" ` Mr. Knightley . ' --You always called me , ` Mr. Knightley ; ' and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal . I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what . \" \" I remember once calling you ` George , ' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again . \" \" And can not you call me ` George ' now ? \" \" Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but ` Mr. Knightley . ' I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton , by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise , \" she added presently , laughing and blushing--\"I will promise to call you once by your Christian name . I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better , for worse . \" Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject.--She could not enter on it.-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them . This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining . She was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on Isabella 's letters . He might observe that it was so . The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy . Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her . Emma 's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet 's being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least . Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back . \" John does not even mention your friend , \" said Mr. Knightley . \" Here is his answer , if you like to see it . \" It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage . Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned . \" John enters like a brother into my happiness , \" continued Mr. Knightley , \" but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes . \" \" He writes like a sensible man , \" replied Emma , when she had read the letter . \" I honour his sincerity . It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him . \" \" My Emma , he means no such thing . He only means-- \" \" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two , \" interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile--\"much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject . \" \" Emma , my dear Emma-- \" \" Oh ! \" she cried with more thorough gaiety , \" if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion . Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _ you _ justice . He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine . I wish I may not sink into ` poor Emma ' with him at once.-- His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther . \" \" Ah ! \" he cried , \" I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together . I am amused by one part of John 's letter-- did you notice it?--where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind . \" \" If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying . He had no idea of me . He seems perfectly unprepared for that . \" \" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings . What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.-- But it was so , I suppose . I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day . I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual . I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now . ' \" The time was coming when the news must spread farther , and other persons ' reception of it tried . As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse 's visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls.-- But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr. Knightley 's absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too . She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself . She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all-- she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person 's company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston , best in the world . Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it . She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do . Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes . That was all very true . Mr. Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could not they go on as they had done ? Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest.-- To Emma 's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley 's , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion.-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs. Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one-- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse 's mind.--It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other-- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . Mrs. Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband 's plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma . How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment -- less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying--\"Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way . \" But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future . It was all right , all open , all equal . No sacrifice on any side worth the name . It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself , and without one real , rational difficulty to oppose or delay it . Mrs. Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world . If any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps . The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.-- He saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it . \" It is to be a secret , I conclude , \" said he . \" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion . \" He went to Highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point . He told her the news . Was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter?--he must tell her ; and Miss Bates being present , it passed , of course , to Mrs. Cole , Mrs. Perry , and Mrs. Elton , immediately afterwards . It was no more than the principals were prepared for ; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls , how soon it would be over Highbury ; and were thinking of themselves , as the evening wonder in many a family circle , with great sagacity . In general , it was a very well approved match . Some might think him , and others might think her , the most in luck . One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell , and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the Vicarage.--There , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction . Mr. Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped \" the young lady 's pride would now be contented ; \" and supposed \" she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ; \" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , \" Rather he than I!\" -- But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--\"Poor Knightley ! poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities.-- How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love-- not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him ! But that would be all over now.-- Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _ her _ . Oh ! no ; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every thing.--Extremely disagreeable ! But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan , living together . It would never do . She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Mrs. Weston"},
