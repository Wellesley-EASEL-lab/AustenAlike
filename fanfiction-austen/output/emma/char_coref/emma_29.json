{"document": "XI It may be possible to do without dancing entirely . Instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made-- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more . Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject . Frank 's was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest . His first proposition and request , that the dance begun at Mr. Cole 's should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence . Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment , and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance ; and the interesting employment had followed , of reckoning up exactly who there would be , and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple . \" You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five , \" had been repeated many times over . \" And there will be the two Gilberts , young Cox , my father , and myself , besides Mr. Knightley . Yes , that will be quite enough for pleasure . You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room . \" But soon it came to be on one side , \" But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think there will . \" On another , \" And after all , five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up . Five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it . It will not do to _ invite _ five couple . It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment . \" Somebody said that _ Miss _ Gilbert was expected at her brother 's , and must be invited with the rest . Somebody else believed _ Mrs _ . Gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked . A word was put in for a second young Cox ; and at last , Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of . The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other . \" Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ? \" It seemed the best scheme ; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better . Emma said it would be awkward ; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper ; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health . It made him so very unhappy , indeed , that it could not be persevered in . \" Oh ! no , \" said he ; \" it would be the extreme of imprudence . I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong . She would catch a dreadful cold . So would poor little Harriet . So you would all . Mrs. Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing . Pray do not let them talk of it . That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless . Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing . He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately . He does not think of the draught . I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing ! \" Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge . She knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away . Every door was now closed , the passage plan given up , and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again ; and with such good - will on Frank Churchill 's part , that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple , was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten . \" We were too magnificent , \" said he . \" We allowed unnecessary room . Ten couple may stand here very well . \" Emma demurred . \" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ? \" \" Very true , \" he gravely replied ; \" it was very bad . \" But still he went on measuring , and still he ended with , \" I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . \" \" No , no , \" said she , \" you are quite unreasonable . It would be dreadful to be standing so close ! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in a little room ! \" \" There is no denying it , \" he replied . \" I agree with you exactly . A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . Exquisite , quite exquisite!--Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . It would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- I do not know that -- I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . \" Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest . Had she intended ever to _ marry _ him , it might have been worth while to pause and consider , and try to understand the value of his preference , and the character of his temper ; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance , he was quite amiable enough . Before the middle of the next day , he was at Hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme . It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement . \" Well , Miss Woodhouse , \" he almost immediately began , \" your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father 's little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a thought of my father 's , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ? \" \" The Crown ! \" \" Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . It is his own idea . Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel . Oh ! you were perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield . Is not it a good exchange?--You consent-- I hope you consent ? \" \" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not . I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- It seems the only improvement that could be . Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ? \" She was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable . \" No ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan-- much worse than the other . A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls . He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh ! no -- a very bad plan . They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere . \" \" I was going to observe , sir , \" said Frank Churchill , \" that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body 's catching cold-- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls ! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could . \" \" Sir , \" said Mr. Woodhouse , rather warmly , \" you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character . Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father 's house . \" \" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief . \" \" Open the windows!--but surely , Mr. Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls . Nobody could be so imprudent ! I never heard of such a thing . Dancing with open windows!--I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . \" \" Ah ! sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected . I have often known it done myself . \" \" Have you indeed , sir?--Bless me ! I never could have supposed it . But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear . However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . One can not resolve upon them in a hurry . If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . \" \" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited-- \" \" Oh ! \" interrupted Emma , \" there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . There is no hurry at all . If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . They will be so near their own stable . \" \" So they will , my dear . That is a great thing . Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted ? I doubt it . I do not know her , even by sight . \" \" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston 's care . Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole . \" \" There , papa!--Now you must be satisfied -- Our own dear Mrs. Weston , who is carefulness itself . Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ? ` If _ Miss _ _ Taylor _ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . ' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! \" \" Aye , very true . Mr. Perry did say so . I shall never forget it . Poor little Emma ! You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry 's great attention . He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . I hope whenever poor Isabella 's little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . \" \" My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , \" said Frank Churchill , \" examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both . It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . \" Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown . There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect . \" Emma , \" said she , \" this paper is worse than I expected . Look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined . \" \" My dear , you are too particular , \" said her husband . \" What does all that signify ? You will see nothing of it by candlelight . It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight . We never see any thing of it on our club - nights . \" The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , \" Men never know when things are dirty or not ; \" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , \" Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares . \" One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain . It regarded a supper - room . At the time of the ballroom 's being built , suppers had not been in question ; and a small card - room adjoining , was the only addition . What was to be done ? This card - room would be wanted as a card - room now ; or , if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves , still was it not too small for any comfortable supper ? Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it . This made a difficulty . Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper . Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches , & c. , set out in the little room ; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion . A private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again . She then took another line of expediency , and looking into the doubtful room , observed , \" I do not think it _ is _ so very small . We shall not be many , you know . \" And Mr. Weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out , \" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs . \" \" I wish , \" said Mrs. Weston , \" one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be . \" \" Yes , very true , \" cried Frank , \" very true . You want your neighbours ' opinions . I do not wonder at you . If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the Coles , for instance . They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ? She is still nearer.-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . I think we do want a larger council . Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ? \" \" Well -- if you please , \" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating , \" if you think she will be of any use . \" \" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , \" said Emma . \" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . She will not even listen to your questions . I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates . \" \" But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk . And I need not bring the whole family , you know . \" Here Mr. Weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation . \" Aye , do , Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once . She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . Fetch Miss Bates . We are growing a little too nice . She is a standing lesson of how to be happy . But fetch them both . Invite them both . \" \" Both sir ! Can the old lady ? \" . . . \" The old lady ! No , the young lady , to be sure . I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . \" \" Oh ! I beg your pardon , sir . I did not immediately recollect . Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both . \" And away he ran . Long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk - moving aunt , and her elegant niece,--Mrs . Weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before-- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision . All the rest , in speculation at least , was perfectly smooth . All the minor arrangements of table and chair , lights and music , tea and supper , made themselves ; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.-- Every body invited , was certainly to come ; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight , which could not possibly be refused . And a delightful dance it was to be . Most cordially , when Miss Bates arrived , did she agree that it must . As a counsellor she was not wanted ; but as an approver , ( a much safer character , ) she was truly welcome . Her approbation , at once general and minute , warm and incessant , could not but please ; and for another half - hour they were all walking to and fro , between the different rooms , some suggesting , some attending , and all in happy enjoyment of the future . The party did not break up without Emma 's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife , \" He has asked her , my dear . That 's right . I knew he would ! \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [102, 104], "text": "Mr. Woodhouse"}, {"position": [109, 110], "text": "his"}, {"position": [728, 730], "text": "Mr. Woodhouse"},
