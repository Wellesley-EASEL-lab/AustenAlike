{"document": "VI The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again . He came with Mrs. Weston , to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially . He had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on Highbury.--\"He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . \" -- Highbury , with Mrs. Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him . They walked thither directly . Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr. Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm . She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend . If he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it . But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied . It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection . And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . They were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse 's ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed . Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings . He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father 's father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good - will towards Highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with . Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him justice . Their first pause was at the Crown Inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place . He was immediately interested . Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased . He saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested . No , it was long enough , broad enough , handsome enough . It would hold the very number for comfort . They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter . Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury ! The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied . He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body 's returning into their proper place the next morning . He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing ; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills . He seemed to have all the life and spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe . Of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind . He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap . It was but an effusion of lively spirits . At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it . \" Yes , oh ! yes\"--he replied ; \" I was just going to mention it . A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour . The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before . \" \" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? \" \" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ? Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.-- A most deplorable want of complexion . \" Emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax 's complexion . \" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face . \" He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health . Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . \" Well , \" said Emma , \" there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion . \" He shook his head and laughed.--\"I can not separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion . \" \" Did you see her often at Weymouth ? Were you often in the same society ? \" At this moment they were approaching Ford 's , and he hastily exclaimed , \" Ha ! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me . He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford 's . If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury . I must buy something at Ford 's . It will be taking out my freedom.-- I dare say they sell gloves . \" \" Oh ! yes , gloves and every thing . I do admire your patriotism . You will be adored in Highbury . You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr. Weston 's son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford 's , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues . \" They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of \" Men 's Beavers \" and \" York Tan \" were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said--\"But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _ amor _ _ patriae _ . Do not let me lose it . I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life . \" \" I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth . \" \" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one . It is always the lady 's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance . Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow . \" \" Upon my word ! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself . But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her . \" \" May I , indeed?--Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well . I met her frequently at Weymouth . I had known the Campbells a little in town ; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set . Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs. Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman . I like them all . \" \" You know Miss Fairfax 's situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? \" \" Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do . \" \" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , \" said Mrs. Weston smiling ; \" remember that I am here.--Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life . I will move a little farther off . \" \" I certainly do forget to think of _ her _ , \" said Emma , \" as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . \" He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment . When the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , \" Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? \" said Frank Churchill . \" Ever hear her ! \" repeated Emma . \" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury . I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . She plays charmingly . \" \" You think so , do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge . She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself.-- I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body 's performance.--I have been used to hear her 's admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage-- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other . That , I thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof . \" \" Proof indeed ! \" said Emma , highly amused.--\"Mr . Dixon is very musical , is he ? We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . \" \" Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof . \" \" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _ I _ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me . I could not excuse a man 's having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ? \" \" It was her very particular friend , you know . \" \" Poor comfort ! \" said Emma , laughing . \" One would rather have a stranger preferred than one 's very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself!-- Poor Mrs. Dixon ! Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland . \" \" You are right . It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it . \" \" So much the better -- or so much the worse:--I do not know which . But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself . She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . \" \" As to that -- I do not-- \" \" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax 's sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself . But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon , one may guess what one chuses . \" \" There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all-- \" he began rather quickly , but checking himself , added , \" however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were-- how it might all be behind the scenes . I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be . \" \" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . But we never did . I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved . \" \" It is a most repulsive quality , indeed , \" said he . \" Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing . There is safety in reserve , but no attraction . One can not love a reserved person . \" \" Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body 's reserve to procure one . Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question . I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . \" He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected . His ideas seemed more moderate-- his feelings warmer . She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton 's house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with . No , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having . If it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house . There must be ample room in it for every real comfort . The man must be a blockhead who wanted more . Mrs. Weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about . Used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size , he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one . But Emma , in her own mind , determined that he _ did _ know what he was talking about , and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life , and to marry , from worthy motives . He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper 's room , or a bad butler 's pantry , but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy , and that whenever he were attached , he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment . VII Emma 's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to London , merely to have his hair cut . A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut . There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve . It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges . His father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that \" all young people would have their little whims . \" With the exception of this little blot , Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him . Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect . This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference-- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance . Mr. Weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight . He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly . As Mrs. Weston observed , \" all young people would have their little whims . \" There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed . In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man-- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr. Knightley . The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , \" Hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for . \" She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant 's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass . Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune . Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave . This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel . On their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means-- the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them . With their wealth , their views increased ; their want of a larger house , their inclination for more company . They added to their house , to their number of servants , to their expenses of every sort ; and by this time were , in fortune and style of living , second only to the family at Hartfield . Their love of society , and their new dining - room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner - company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place . The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite-- neither Donwell , nor Hartfield , nor Randalls . Nothing should tempt _ her _ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father 's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish . The Coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them . This lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley , none of Mr. Weston . But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared , that when the insult came at last , it found her very differently affected . Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs. Weston 's accounting for it with \" I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , \" was not quite sufficient . She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept . Harriet was to be there in the evening , and the Bateses . They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before , and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence . Might not the evening end in a dance ? had been a question of his . The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment , was but poor comfort . It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that \" of course it must be declined , \" she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful . She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party . The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it-- so much consideration for her father . \" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . \" Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs. Goddard , if not Mrs. Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company-- Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter 's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him . As for _ his _ going , Emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous . He was soon pretty well resigned . \" I am not fond of dinner - visiting , \" said he--\"I never was . No more is Emma . Late hours do not agree with us . I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . \" Then turning to Mrs. Weston , with a look of gentle reproach--\"Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . \" \" Well , sir , \" cried Mr. Weston , \" as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . \" But the idea of any thing to be done in a _ moment _ , was increasing , not lessening , Mr. Woodhouse 's agitation . The ladies knew better how to allay it . Mr. Weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged . With this treatment , Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual . \" He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard . He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her . James could take the note . But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole . \" \" You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _ compliments _ , of course . But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done . We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him . We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely . And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over . \" \" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? \" \" Oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . There will be a great many people talking at once . You will not like the noise . \" \" But , my dear sir , \" cried Mr. Weston , \" if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party . \" \" And no great harm if it does , \" said Mr. Woodhouse . \" The sooner every party breaks up , the better . \" \" But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles . Emma 's going away directly after tea might be giving offence . They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body 's hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse 's doing it would be more thought of than any other person 's in the room . You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years . \" \" No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me . I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . I know what worthy people they are . Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr. Cole is very bilious . No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , we must consider this . I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . You will not regard being tired . You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . \" \" Oh yes , papa . I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account . I am only afraid of your sitting up for me . I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard . She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must promise me not to sit up . \" He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual .", "clusters": [{"mentions":
