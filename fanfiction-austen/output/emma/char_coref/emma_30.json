{"document": "XII One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill 's stay in Surry ; for , in spite of Mr. Weston 's confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight . But this was not judged feasible . The preparations must take their time , nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on , and for a few days they must be planning , proceeding and hoping in uncertainty -- at the risk-- in her opinion , the great risk , of its being all in vain . Enscombe however was gracious , gracious in fact , if not in word . His wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed . All was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , Emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley 's provoking indifference about it . Either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement . To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply , than , \" Very well . If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.-- Oh ! yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins 's week 's account ; much rather , I confess.-- Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I , indeed -- I never look at it-- I do not know who does.--Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward . Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different . \" This Emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry . It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent , or so indignant ; he was not guided by _ her _ feelings in reprobating the ball , for _ she _ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree . It made her animated -- open hearted-- she voluntarily said;-- \" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . What a disappointment it would be ! I do look forward to it , I own , with _ very _ great pleasure . \" It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins . No!--she was more and more convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise . There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love . Alas ! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley . Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing . A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew 's instant return . Mrs. Churchill was unwell-- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay . The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma , in a note from Mrs. Weston , instantly . As to his going , it was inevitable . He must be gone within a few hours , though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt , to lessen his repugnance . He knew her illnesses ; they never occurred but for her own convenience . Mrs. Weston added , \" that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon . \" This wretched note was the finale of Emma 's breakfast . When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim . The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man-- and all that the young man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy ! and she and her partner the happiest!--\"I said it would be so , \" was the only consolation . Her father 's feelings were quite distinct . He thought principally of Mrs. Churchill 's illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home . Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him . He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it . His dejection was most evident . He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , it was only to say , \" Of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst . \" \" But you will come again , \" said Emma . \" This will not be your only visit to Randalls . \" \" Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able to return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- but I am afraid -- they did not stir last spring-- I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever . \" \" Our poor ball must be quite given up . \" \" Ah ! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ? \" \" Indeed , I am very sorry to be right in this instance . I would much rather have been merry than wise . \" \" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball . My father depends on it . Do not forget your engagement . \" Emma looked graciously . \" Such a fortnight as it has been ! \" he continued ; \" every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making me less fit to bear any other place . Happy those , who can remain at Highbury ! \" \" As you do us such ample justice now , \" said Emma , laughing , \" I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ? Do not we rather surpass your expectations ? I am sure we do . I am sure you did not much expect to like us . You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury . \" He laughed rather consciously ; and though denying the sentiment , Emma was convinced that it had been so . \" And you must be off this very morning ? \" \" Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately . I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . \" \" Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ? How unlucky ! Miss Bates 's powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours . \" \" Yes -- I _ have _ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better . It was a right thing to do . I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates 's being absent . She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . She is a woman that one may , that one _ must _ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight . It was better to pay my visit , then\"-- He hesitated , got up , walked to a window . \" In short , \" said he , \" perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion\"-- He looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts . She hardly knew what to say . It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish . Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said , \" You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then\"-- He was silent . She believed he was looking at her ; probably reflecting on what she had said , and trying to understand the manner . She heard him sigh . It was natural for him to feel that he had _ cause _ to sigh . He could not believe her to be encouraging him . A few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said , \" It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield . My regard for Hartfield is most warm\"-- He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed.-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ? Mr. Woodhouse soon followed ; and the necessity of exertion made him composed . A very few minutes more , however , completed the present trial . Mr. Weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , \" It was time to go ; \" and the young man , though he might and did sigh , could not but agree , to take leave . \" I shall hear about you all , \" said he ; \" that is my chief consolation . I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you . I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me . She has been so kind as to promise it . Oh ! the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing . In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again . \" A very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest \" Good - bye , \" closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill . Short had been the notice -- short their meeting ; he was gone ; and Emma felt so sorry to part , and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry , and feeling it too much . It was a sad change . They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival . Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- indescribable spirit ; the idea , the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought , the assurance of his attentions , his liveliness , his manners ! It had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days . To complete every other recommendation , he had _ almost _ told her that he loved her . What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _ must _ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it . \" I certainly must , \" said she . \" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing 's being dull and insipid about the house!-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least . Well ! evil to some is always good to others . I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr. Knightley will be happy . He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes . \" Mr. Knightley , however , shewed no triumphant happiness . He could not say that he was sorry on his own account ; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had ; but he said , and very steadily , that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others , and with considerable kindness added , \" You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck ! \" It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious . She had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think Jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [16, 17], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [46, 47], "text": "she"},
