{"document": "II Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs. Bates 's youngest daughter . The marriage of Lieut . Fairfax of the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl . By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations . But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny . This was Colonel Campbell , who had very highly regarded Fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp - fever , as he believed had saved his life . These were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax , before his own return to England put any thing in his power . When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her . He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane 's age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter 's great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education . It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell 's family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time . The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell 's power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter 's ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . Such was Jane Fairfax 's history . She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education . Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell 's residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters . Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with . Neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it . The evil day was put off . It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane 's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn . This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period . With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever . The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did . As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last , had better be soon . Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished . Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment . She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter 's marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort . With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told . It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence . Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But \" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . \" These were her reasons-- she had no better . It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance . Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two . Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features-- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty . Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom . It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it:--elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury . There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit . In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on . Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon 's actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first . If it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone . She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty . Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her . These were charming feelings -- but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , \" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! \" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . Former provocations reappeared . The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again . They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance . She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious ! There was no getting at her real opinion . Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing . She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved . If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing . She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon 's character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match . It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished . It did her no service however . Her caution was thrown away . Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises . There probably _ was _ something more to conceal than her own preference ; Mr. Dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to Miss Campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds . The like reserve prevailed on other topics . She and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time . It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was . \" Was he handsome?\" --\"She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man . \" \" Was he agreeable?\" -- \" He was generally thought so . \" \" Did he appear a sensible young man ; a young man of information?\" --\"At a watering - place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill . She believed every body found his manners pleasing . \" Emma could not forgive her .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 16], "text": "Mrs. Bates 's youngest daughter"}, {"position": [37,
