{"document": "XVI The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst of all . Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken-- more in error -- more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself . \" If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man , I could have borne any thing . He might have doubled his presumption to me-- but poor Harriet ! \" How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet -- never ! She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion . She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it . His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled . The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!-- and the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;-- how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet . To be sure , the charade , with its \" ready wit\"--but then the \" soft eyes\"-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth . Who could have seen through such thick - headed nonsense ? Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet 's friend . To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility . There was no denying that those brothers had penetration . She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself . It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr. Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others . Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr. Elton 's wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . His professions and his proposals did him no service . She thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes . He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for . There had been no real affection either in his language or manners . Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love . She need not trouble herself to pity him . He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten . But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ) , to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!--look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!-- It was most provoking . Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind . The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the Eltons were nobody . The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.-- But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr. Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If _ she _ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _ he _ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers . The first error and the worst lay at her door . It was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together . It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple . She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . \" Here have I , \" said she , \" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man . She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him . Oh ! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin . There I was quite right . That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance . I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more . But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time . I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _ not _ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe -- Oh ! no , I could not endure William Coxe-- a pert young lawyer . \" She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be . The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma 's , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits . The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet 's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive-- and that there could be no necessity for any body 's knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father 's being given a moment 's uneasiness about it . These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present . The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church . Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton 's absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them,-- \" Ah ! Mr. Knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton ? \" These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield . He was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body . But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [13, 14], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [31, 32], "text": "she"}, {"position": [82, 83], "text": "she"}, {"position": [104,
