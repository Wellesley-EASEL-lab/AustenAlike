{"document": "XIV Mrs. Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all . Emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of Harriet 's going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible . She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _ recollecting _ . A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur . Compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent . The visit was of course short ; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it , that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady , and on no account to give one , beyond the nothing - meaning terms of being \" elegantly dressed , and very pleasing . \" She did not really like her . She would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease , but not elegance.-- She was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease . Her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant . Emma thought at least it would turn out so . As for Mr. Elton , his manners did not appear -- but no , she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners . It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it . The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be . \" Well , Miss Woodhouse , \" said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; \" Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of her?-- Is not she very charming ? \" There was a little hesitation in Emma 's answer . \" Oh ! yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman . \" \" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful . \" \" Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown . \" \" I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . \" \" Oh ! no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way . \" \" I dare say , \" returned Harriet , sighing again , \" I dare say she was very much attached to him . \" \" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man 's fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . \" \" Yes , \" said Harriet earnestly , \" and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . Well , I wish them happy with all my heart . And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again . He is just as superior as ever;--but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery . To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort!-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . Happy creature ! He called her ` Augusta . ' How delightful ! \" When the visit was returned , Emma made up her mind . She could then see more and judge better . From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match . If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set . The rich brother - in - law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him . The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove , \" My brother Mr. Suckling 's seat;\"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove . The grounds of Hartfield were small , but neat and pretty ; and the house was modern and well - built . Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room , the entrance , and all that she could see or imagine . \" Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister 's favourite room . \"-- Mr. Elton was appealed to.--\"Was not it astonishingly like?-- She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove . \" \" And the staircase -- You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house . I really could not help exclaiming ! I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove . I have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ) . A charming place , undoubtedly . Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony . \" Emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton , who only wanted to be talking herself . \" So extremely like Maple Grove ! And it is not merely the house-- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like . The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind ! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style . \" Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment . She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed , and therefore only said in reply , \" When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield . Surry is full of beauties . \" \" Oh ! yes , I am quite aware of that . It is the garden of England , you know . Surry is the garden of England . \" \" Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry . \" \" No , I fancy not , \" replied Mrs. Elton , with a most satisfied smile . \" I never heard any county but Surry called so . \" Emma was silenced . \" My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest , \" continued Mrs. Elton ; \" and that will be our time for exploring . While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say . They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _ our _ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year . Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring . We explored to King's - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau . You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ? \" \" No ; not immediately here . We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure . \" \" Ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am . I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove . Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ` I really can not get this girl to move from the house . I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling . ' Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion . I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse-- ( looking towards Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father 's state of health must be a great drawback . Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should . Let me recommend Bath to you . I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . \" \" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . \" \" Ah ! that 's a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it ! And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse 's spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed . And as to its recommendations to _ you _ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them . The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood . It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . \" It was as much as Emma could bear , without being impolite . The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an _ introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton's -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live!-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk indeed ! She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly ; \" but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father . \" And then , to prevent farther outrage and indignation , changed the subject directly . \" I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton . Upon these occasions , a lady 's character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . \" \" Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea . A superior performer!--very far from it , I assure you . Consider from how partial a quarter your information came . I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _ mediocre _ to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into . I absolutely can not do without music . It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice . I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what I had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension . When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _ the _ _ world _ I could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for I had no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _ me _ . I could do very well without it . To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent . And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought . I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ` But , ' said I , ` to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society . I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me . ' \" \" We can not suppose , \" said Emma , smiling , \" that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _ very _ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive . \" \" No , indeed , I have no doubts at all on that head . I am delighted to find myself in such a circle . I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . Will not it be a good plan ? If _ we _ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies . Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _ me _ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know-- there is a sad story against them , in general . They are but too apt to give up music . \" \" But you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ? \" \" I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble . Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly . And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and of the two Milmans , now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate . Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . \" \" But every thing of that kind , \" said Emma , \" will soon be in so regular a train-- \" \" Well , \" said Mrs. Elton , laughing , \" we shall see . \" Emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment 's pause , Mrs. Elton chose another subject . \" We have been calling at Randalls , \" said she , \" and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be . I like them extremely . Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature-- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you . And _ she _ appears so truly good -- there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly . She was your governess , I think ? \" Emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on . \" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like ! But she is really quite the gentlewoman . \" \" Mrs. Weston 's manners , \" said Emma , \" were always particularly good . Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . \" \" And who do you think came in while we were there ? \" Emma was quite at a loss . The tone implied some old acquaintance-- and how could she possibly guess ? \" Knightley ! \" continued Mrs. Elton ; \" Knightley himself!--Was not it lucky?--for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. 's , I had a great curiosity . ` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . Knightley is quite the gentleman . I like him very much . Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man . \" Happily , it was now time to be gone . They were off ; and Emma could breathe . \" Insufferable woman ! \" was her immediate exclamation . \" Worse than I had supposed . Absolutely insufferable ! Knightley!--I could not have believed it . Knightley!--never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman ! A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr. E. , and her _ caro _ _ sposo _ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman ! I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady . I could not have believed it ! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club ! One would fancy we were bosom friends ! And Mrs. Weston!-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse . I never met with her equal . Much beyond my hopes . Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . Oh ! what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ? How angry and how diverted he would be ! Ah ! there I am-- thinking of him directly . Always the first person to be thought of ! How I catch myself out ! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!\" -- All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending . \" Well , my dear , \" he deliberately began , \" considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you . She speaks a little too quick . A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . But I believe I am nice ; I do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor . However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife . Though I think he had better not have married . I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _ should _ in the course of the summer . But I ought to have gone before . Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss . Ah ! it shews what a sad invalid I am ! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane . \" \" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir . Mr. Elton knows you . \" \" Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . It was being very deficient . \" \" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _ bride _ ? It ought to be no recommendation to _ you _ . It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them . \" \" No , my dear , I never encouraged any body to marry , but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected . More is avowedly due to _ her _ . A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may . \" \" Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is . And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies . \" \" My dear , you do not understand me . This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry . \" Emma had done . Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _ her _ . Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton 's offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Mrs. Elton"}, {"position": [48, 49], "text":
