{"document": "IX Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles . The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would not soon die away . Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy . She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax 's feelings to Frank Churchill . It was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue . The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had no doubt . She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing . She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half . She was then interrupted by Harriet 's coming in ; and if Harriet 's praise could have satisfied her , she might soon have been comforted . \" Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax ! \" \" Do n't class us together , Harriet . My playing is no more like her 's , than a lamp is like sunshine . \" \" Oh ! dear -- I think you play the best of the two . I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . \" \" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax 's is much beyond it . \" \" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution . \" \" Ah ! but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet . \" \" Are you sure ? I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste . Nobody talked about it . And I hate Italian singing.-- There is no understanding a word of it . Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . How did you think the Coxes looked ? \" \" Just as they always do -- very vulgar . \" \" They told me something , \" said Harriet rather hesitatingly ; \" but it is nothing of any consequence . \" Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton . \" They told me -- that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday . \" \" Oh ! \" \" He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner . \" \" Oh ! \" \" They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox . I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer . \" \" She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be . \" \" She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . He sat by her at dinner . Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him . \" \" Very likely.--I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . \" Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with her . Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous . Harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;-- Mr. Perry walking hastily by , Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office - door , Mr. Cole 's carriage - horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter - boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker 's little bow - window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door . A mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer . She looked down the Randalls road . The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs. Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course . They were stopping , however , in the first place at Mrs. Bates 's ; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford 's ; and had all but knocked , when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her ; and the agreeableness of yesterday 's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting . Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument . \" For my companion tells me , \" said she , \" that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning . I was not aware of it myself . I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now . \" \" And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope , \" said Frank Churchill , \" to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield-- if you are going home . \" Mrs. Weston was disappointed . \" I thought you meant to go with me . They would be very much pleased . \" \" Me ! I should be quite in the way . But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here . Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . What am I to do ? \" \" I am here on no business of my own , \" said Emma ; \" I am only waiting for my friend . She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home . But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument . \" \" Well -- if you advise it.--But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall I say ? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston . She might do very well by herself . A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood . \" \" I do not believe any such thing , \" replied Emma.--\"I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax 's opinion last night . \" \" Do come with me , \" said Mrs. Weston , \" if it be not very disagreeable to you . It need not detain us long . We will go to Hartfield afterwards . We will follow them to Hartfield . I really wish you to call with me . It will be felt so great an attention ! and I always thought you meant it . \" He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates 's door . Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern . At last it was all settled , even to the destination of the parcel . \" Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard 's , ma'am ? \" asked Mrs. Ford.-- \" Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs. Goddard 's . Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield . No , you shall send it to Hartfield , if you please . But then , Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown home any day . But I shall want the ribbon directly-- so it had better go to Hartfield -- at least the ribbon . You could make it into two parcels , Mrs. Ford , could not you ? \" \" It is not worth while , Harriet , to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels . \" \" No more it is . \" \" No trouble in the world , ma'am , \" said the obliging Mrs. Ford . \" Oh ! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one . Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's-- I do not know -- No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night . What do you advise ? \" \" That you do not give another half - second to the subject . To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs. Ford . \" \" Aye , that will be much best , \" said Harriet , quite satisfied , \" I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard 's . \" Voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies : Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door . \" My dear Miss Woodhouse , \" said the latter , \" I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and Miss Smith . How do you do , Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding . \" \" I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are-- \" \" Very well , I am much obliged to you . My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night . How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad to hear such a good account . Mrs. Weston told me you were here.-- Oh ! then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she can not refuse.--`Aye , pray do , ' said Mr. Frank Churchill , ` Miss Woodhouse 's opinion of the instrument will be worth having . '-- But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--`Oh , ' said he , ` wait half a minute , till I have finished my job;'--For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother 's spectacles.--The rivet came out , you know , this morning.-- So very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles-- could not put them on . And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . Jane said so . I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me . Here is the rivet of your mistress 's spectacles out . Then the baked apples came home , Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . And it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us.-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off . But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street . Not that I had any doubt before-- I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple . I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple - dumplings , however , very often . Patty makes an excellent apple - dumpling . Well , Mrs. Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us . \" Emma would be \" very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , \" and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from Miss Bates than , \" How do you do , Mrs. Ford ? I beg your pardon . I did not see you before . I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town . Jane came back delighted yesterday . Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in . \" \" What was I talking of ? \" said she , beginning again when they were all in the street . Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix . \" I declare I can not recollect what I was talking of.--Oh ! my mother 's spectacles . So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill ! ` Oh ! ' said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively . ' --Which you know shewed him to be so very . . . . Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing . . . . I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest parent could . . . . ` Oh ! ' said he , ` I can fasten the rivet . I like a job of that sort excessively . ' I never shall forget his manner . And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh ! ' said he directly , ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest - looking home - baked apples I ever saw in my life . ' That , you know , was so very . . . . And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times-- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr. Knightley 's most liberal supply . He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them . My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . But I was really quite shocked the other day-- for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ` I am sure you must be , ' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use . William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing . ' So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same . And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _ that _ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master 's profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring . He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world ! He would be so very . . . . I wanted to keep it from Jane 's knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware . \" Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will . \" Pray take care , Mrs. Weston , there is a step at the turning . Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase-- rather darker and narrower than one could wish . Miss Smith , pray take care . Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot . Miss Smith , the step at the turning . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [5, 6], "text": "her"}, {"position": [16, 17], "text": "her"}, {"position":
