{"document": "V Small heart had Harriet for visiting . Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard 's , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _ The _ _ Rev. _ _ Philip _ _ Elton _ , _ White - Hart _ , _ Bath _ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher 's cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank . She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour . She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell . The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and Miss Smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young man . She came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a Miss Martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility . Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account . She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating . She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls . They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time-- till just at last , when Mrs. Martin 's saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner . In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends . There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window . _ He _ had done it . They all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy , ) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over . The style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive . Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally Harriet must suffer . It was a bad business . She would have given a great deal , or endured a great deal , to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life . They were so deserving , that a _ little _ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent . They must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process-- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it . Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins . The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary . It was a good scheme ; but on driving to the door they heard that neither \" master nor mistress was at home ; \" they had both been out some time ; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield . \" This is too bad , \" cried Emma , as they turned away . \" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so disappointed . \" And she leaned back in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or to reason them away ; probably a little of both-- such being the commonest process of a not ill - disposed mind . Presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston , who were standing to speak to her . There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her with , \" How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father-- glad to see him so well . Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty-- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so . If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . \" There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston 's , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose . To know that _ she _ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy . It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits . The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment 's thought , she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more . Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . \" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , \" said he , at the conclusion . Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife . \" We had better move on , Mr. Weston , \" said she , \" we are detaining the girls . \" \" Well , well , I am ready;\"--and turning again to Emma , \" but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man ; you have only had _ my _ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:\"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction . Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing . \" Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o'clock , \" was Mrs. Weston 's parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her . \" Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three , \" was Mr. Weston 's quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting . Emma 's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before . When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there . \" Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\" -- was a question , however , which did not augur much . But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time . The morning of the interesting day arrived , and Mrs. Weston 's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o'clock , that she was to think of her at four . \" My dear , dear anxious friend,\"--said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , \" always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . \" The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall . \" ' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . I am sure they will bring him soon . \" She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr. Weston and his son . They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank 's being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure . The Frank Churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _ very _ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father 's ; he looked quick and sensible . She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be . He had reached Randalls the evening before . She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker , that he might gain half a day . \" I told you yesterday , \" cried Mr. Weston with exultation , \" I told you all that he would be here before the time named . I remembered what I used to do myself . One can not creep upon a journey ; one can not help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one 's friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs . \" \" It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it , \" said the young man , \" though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _ home _ I felt I might do any thing . \" The word _ home _ made his father look on him with fresh complacency . Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed . He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one 's _ own _ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it . That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma 's brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled . His manner had no air of study or exaggeration . He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment . Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance . On his side were the inquiries,--\"Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?-- Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls -- had they balls?--Was it a musical society ? \" But when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please-- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her . He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter . He understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else . \" His father 's marriage , \" he said , \" had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him . \" He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor 's merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse 's character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor 's . And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person . \" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for , \" said he ; \" but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston . \" \" You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , \" said Emma ; \" were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . Do n't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . \" \" I hope I should know better , \" he replied ; \" no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow , ) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms . \" Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance . She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable . She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about . His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening . Her own father 's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance . Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.-- Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged , he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any ; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons ' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them . She blessed the favouring blindness . He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill 's accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night . A reasonable visit paid , Mr. Weston began to move.--\"He must be going . He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford 's , but he need not hurry any body else . \" His son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying , \" As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates . Do you know any family of that name ? \" \" To be sure we do , \" cried his father ; \" Mrs. Bates -- we passed her house-- I saw Miss Bates at the window . True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is . Call upon her , by all means . \" \" There is no necessity for my calling this morning , \" said the young man ; \" another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which-- \" \" Oh ! go to - day , go to - day . Do not defer it . What is right to be done can not be done too soon . And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _ here _ should be carefully avoided . You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on . If you do not call early it will be a slight . \" The son looked convinced . \" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , \" said Emma ; \" she is a very elegant young woman . \" He agreed to it , but with so quiet a \" Yes , \" as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it . \" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , \" said she , \" I think you will to - day . You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . \" \" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? \" said Mr. Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; \" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way . \" \" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . \" \" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . \" Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , \" My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates 's , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump . \" They were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave . Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort .",
