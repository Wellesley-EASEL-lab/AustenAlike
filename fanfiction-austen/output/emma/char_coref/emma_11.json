{"document": "IV Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations , that a young person , who either marries or dies , is sure of being kindly spoken of . A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins 's name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played . Mr. Elton returned , a very happy man . He had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one . He had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior , of course , to the first , as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost . He came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith . The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity-- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at Mr. Green 's , and the party at Mrs. Brown's -- smiles and blushes rising in importance-- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented . He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant . The wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for Bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole 's did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride . During his present short stay , Emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air . She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again . She wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction . The pain of his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage . Many vain solicitudes would be prevented-- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it . A _ Mrs. _ _ Elton _ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark . It would be almost beginning their life of civility again . Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little . She was good enough for Mr. Elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury-- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by Harriet 's side . As to connexion , there Emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet , he had done nothing . On that article , truth seemed attainable . _ What _ she was , must be uncertain ; but _ who _ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10,000 l. , it did not appear that she was at all Harriet 's superior . She brought no name , no blood , no alliance . Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol-- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained-- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived . Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise . And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _ very _ _ well _ _ married _ , to a gentleman in a _ great _ _ way _ , near Bristol , who kept two carriages ! That was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins . Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all ! She had talked her into love ; but , alas ! she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet 's mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her . Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love . And now , poor girl ! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton . She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other . Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _ just _ to meet with him , or _ just _ to miss him , _ just _ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _ just _ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture . She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins 's happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached!-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love ! Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet 's mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations . Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other . Mr. Elton 's engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin . The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin 's calling at Mrs. Goddard 's a few days afterwards . Harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess . But Mr. Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares . While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin 's visit . How that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary-- and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration . Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude . It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!-- After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet 's returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance . She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future . She could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of Harriet ? V Small heart had Harriet for visiting . Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard 's , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _ The _ _ Rev. _ _ Philip _ _ Elton _ , _ White - Hart _ , _ Bath _ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher 's cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank . She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour . She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell . The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and Miss Smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young man . She came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a Miss Martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility . Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account . She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating . She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls . They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time-- till just at last , when Mrs. Martin 's saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner . In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends . There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window . _ He _ had done it . They all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy , ) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over . The style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive . Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally Harriet must suffer . It was a bad business . She would have given a great deal , or endured a great deal , to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life . They were so deserving , that a _ little _ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent . They must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process-- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it . Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins . The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary . It was a good scheme ; but on driving to the door they heard that neither \" master nor mistress was at home ; \" they had both been out some time ; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield . \" This is too bad , \" cried Emma , as they turned away . \" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so disappointed . \" And she leaned back in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or to reason them away ; probably a little of both-- such being the commonest process of a not ill - disposed mind . Presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston , who were standing to speak to her . There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her with , \" How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father-- glad to see him so well . Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty-- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so . If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . \" There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston 's , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose . To know that _ she _ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy . It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits . The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment 's thought , she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more . Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . \" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , \" said he , at the conclusion . Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife . \" We had better move on , Mr. Weston , \" said she , \" we are detaining the girls . \" \" Well , well , I am ready;\"--and turning again to Emma , \" but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man ; you have only had _ my _ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:\"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction . Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing . \" Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o'clock , \" was Mrs. Weston 's parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her . \" Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three , \" was Mr. Weston 's quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting . Emma 's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before . When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there . \" Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\" -- was a question , however , which did not augur much . But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time . The morning of the interesting day arrived , and Mrs. Weston 's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o'clock , that she was to think of her at four . \" My dear , dear anxious friend,\"--said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , \" always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . \" The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall . \" ' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . I am sure they will bring him soon . \" She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr. Weston and his son . They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank 's being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure . The Frank Churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _ very _ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father 's ; he looked quick and sensible . She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be . He had reached Randalls the evening before . She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker , that he might gain half a day . \" I told you yesterday , \" cried Mr. Weston with exultation , \" I told you all that he would be here before the time named . I remembered what I used to do myself . One can not creep upon a journey ; one can not help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one 's friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs . \" \" It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it , \" said the young man , \" though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _ home _ I felt I might do any thing . \" The word _ home _ made his father look on him with fresh complacency . Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed . He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one 's _ own _ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it . That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma 's brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled . His manner had no air of study or exaggeration . He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment . Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance . On his side were the inquiries,--\"Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?-- Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls -- had they balls?--Was it a musical society ? \" But when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please-- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her . He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter . He understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else . \" His father 's marriage , \" he said , \" had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him . \" He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor 's merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse 's character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor 's . And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person . \" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for , \" said he ; \" but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston . \" \" You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , \" said Emma ; \" were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . Do n't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . \" \" I hope I should know better , \" he replied ; \" no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow , ) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms . \" Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance . She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable . She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about . His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening . Her own father 's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance . Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.-- Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged , he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any ; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons ' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them . She blessed the favouring blindness . He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill 's accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night . A reasonable visit paid , Mr. Weston began to move.--\"He must be going . He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford 's , but he need not hurry any body else . \" His son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying , \" As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates . Do you know any family of that name ? \" \" To be sure we do , \" cried his father ; \" Mrs. Bates -- we passed her house-- I saw Miss Bates at the window . True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is . Call upon her , by all means . \" \" There is no necessity for my calling this morning , \" said the young man ; \" another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which-- \" \" Oh ! go to - day , go to - day . Do not defer it . What is right to be done can not be done too soon . And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _ here _ should be carefully avoided . You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on . If you do not call early it will be a slight . \" The son looked convinced . \" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , \" said Emma ; \" she is a very elegant young woman . \" He agreed to it , but with so quiet a \" Yes , \" as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it . \" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , \" said she , \" I think you will to - day . You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . \" \" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? \" said Mr. Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; \" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way . \" \" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . \" \" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . \" Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , \" My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates 's , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump . \" They were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave . Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort .",
