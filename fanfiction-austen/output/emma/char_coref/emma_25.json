{"document": "VII Emma 's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to London , merely to have his hair cut . A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut . There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve . It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges . His father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that \" all young people would have their little whims . \" With the exception of this little blot , Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him . Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect . This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference-- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance . Mr. Weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight . He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly . As Mrs. Weston observed , \" all young people would have their little whims . \" There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed . In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man-- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr. Knightley . The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , \" Hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for . \" She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant 's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass . Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune . Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave . This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel . On their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means-- the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them . With their wealth , their views increased ; their want of a larger house , their inclination for more company . They added to their house , to their number of servants , to their expenses of every sort ; and by this time were , in fortune and style of living , second only to the family at Hartfield . Their love of society , and their new dining - room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner - company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place . The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite-- neither Donwell , nor Hartfield , nor Randalls . Nothing should tempt _ her _ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father 's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish . The Coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them . This lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley , none of Mr. Weston . But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared , that when the insult came at last , it found her very differently affected . Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs. Weston 's accounting for it with \" I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , \" was not quite sufficient . She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept . Harriet was to be there in the evening , and the Bateses . They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before , and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence . Might not the evening end in a dance ? had been a question of his . The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment , was but poor comfort . It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that \" of course it must be declined , \" she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful . She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party . The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it-- so much consideration for her father . \" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . \" Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs. Goddard , if not Mrs. Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company-- Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter 's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him . As for _ his _ going , Emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous . He was soon pretty well resigned . \" I am not fond of dinner - visiting , \" said he--\"I never was . No more is Emma . Late hours do not agree with us . I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . \" Then turning to Mrs. Weston , with a look of gentle reproach--\"Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . \" \" Well , sir , \" cried Mr. Weston , \" as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . \" But the idea of any thing to be done in a _ moment _ , was increasing , not lessening , Mr. Woodhouse 's agitation . The ladies knew better how to allay it . Mr. Weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged . With this treatment , Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual . \" He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard . He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her . James could take the note . But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole . \" \" You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _ compliments _ , of course . But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done . We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him . We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely . And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over . \" \" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? \" \" Oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . There will be a great many people talking at once . You will not like the noise . \" \" But , my dear sir , \" cried Mr. Weston , \" if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party . \" \" And no great harm if it does , \" said Mr. Woodhouse . \" The sooner every party breaks up , the better . \" \" But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles . Emma 's going away directly after tea might be giving offence . They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body 's hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse 's doing it would be more thought of than any other person 's in the room . You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years . \" \" No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me . I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . I know what worthy people they are . Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr. Cole is very bilious . No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , we must consider this . I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . You will not regard being tired . You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . \" \" Oh yes , papa . I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account . I am only afraid of your sitting up for me . I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard . She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must promise me not to sit up . \" He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual .", "clusters": [{"mentions":
