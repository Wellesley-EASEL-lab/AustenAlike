{"document": "III Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way . He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked . He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms . Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr. Knightley , comprehended many such . Not unfrequently , through Emma 's persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him . Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse 's drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away . After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates , and Mrs. Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses . Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance . Mrs. Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite . Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married . Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect . She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness . Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible . And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will . It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders . She loved every body , was interested in every body 's happiness , quicksighted to every body 's merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing . The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself . She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School -- not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity -- but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies . Mrs. Goddard 's school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands . It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church . She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse 's kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father 's sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston . She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated . As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion . Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody . Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs. Goddard 's school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder . This was all that was generally known of her history . She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her . She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired . She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith 's conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . Encouragement should be given . Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions . The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her . The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm . They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _ She _ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners . It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers . She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware . With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests . Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare . He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat . Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say : \" Mrs. Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs . An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome . Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body . I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you . Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _ little _ bit of tart -- a _ very _ little bit . Ours are all apple - tarts . You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here . I do not advise the custard . Mrs. Goddard , what say you to _ half _ a glass of wine ? A _ small _ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ? I do not think it could disagree with you . \" Emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions . Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3],
