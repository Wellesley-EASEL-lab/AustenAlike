{"document": "V In this state of schemes , and hopes , and connivance , June opened upon Hartfield . To Highbury in general it brought no material change . The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother 's ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton 's activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . Mr. Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma . That Emma was his object appeared indisputable . Every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father 's hints , his mother - in - law 's guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story . But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax . He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least-- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of Emma 's errors of imagination . _ She _ was not present when the suspicion first arose . He was dining with the Randalls family , and Jane , at the Eltons ' ; and he had seen a look , more than a single look , at Miss Fairfax , which , from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place . When he was again in their company , he could not help remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid observations which , unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight , \" Myself creating what I saw , \" brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between Frank Churchill and Jane . He had walked up one day after dinner , as he very often did , to spend his evening at Hartfield . Emma and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had accidentally met . They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him . The Randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse 's most obliging invitation . As they were turning into the grounds , Mr. Perry passed by on horseback . The gentlemen spoke of his horse . \" By the bye , \" said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently , \" what became of Mr. Perry 's plan of setting up his carriage ? \" Mrs. Weston looked surprized , and said , \" I did not know that he ever had any such plan . \" \" Nay , I had it from you . You wrote me word of it three months ago . \" \" Me ! impossible ! \" \" Indeed you did . I remember it perfectly . You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . Mrs. Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . It was owing to _ her _ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . You must remember it now ? \" \" Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment . \" \" Never ! really , never!--Bless me ! how could it be?--Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was completely persuaded -- Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired . You will not be sorry to find yourself at home . \" \" What is this?--What is this ? \" cried Mr. Weston , \" about Perry and a carriage ? Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ? I am glad he can afford it . You had it from himself , had you ? \" \" No , sir , \" replied his son , laughing , \" I seem to have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston 's having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream . I am a great dreamer . I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away-- and when I have gone through my particular friends , then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry . \" \" It is odd though , \" observed his father , \" that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe . Perry 's setting up his carriage ! and his wife 's persuading him to it , out of care for his health-- just what will happen , I have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature . What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream ! And at others , what a heap of absurdities it is ! Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent . Emma , you are a great dreamer , I think ? \" Emma was out of hearing . She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston 's hint . \" Why , to own the truth , \" cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , \" if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to-- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls . Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware . I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not . I am not like Jane ; I wish I were . I will answer for it _ she _ never betrayed the least thing in the world . Where is she?--Oh ! just behind . Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry 's coming.-- Extraordinary dream , indeed ! \" They were entering the hall . Mr. Knightley 's eyes had preceded Miss Bates 's in a glance at Jane . From Frank Churchill 's face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl . Mr. Weston had walked in . The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass . Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye-- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so-- Jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither . There was no time for farther remark or explanation . The dream must be borne with , and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield , and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small - sized Pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded . Tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move . \" Miss Woodhouse , \" said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , \" have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ? It used to stand here . Where is it ? This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . We had great amusement with those letters one morning . I want to puzzle you again . \" Emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves . They were rapidly forming words for each other , or for any body else who would be puzzled . The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the \" poor little boys , \" or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it . Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax . She gave a slight glance round the table , and applied herself to it . Frank was next to Emma , Jane opposite to them -- and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation . The word was discovered , and with a faint smile pushed away . If meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across , for it was not mixed ; and Harriet , eager after every fresh word , and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work . She was sitting by Mr. Knightley , and turned to him for help . The word was _ blunder _ ; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on Jane 's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible . Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream ; but how it could all be , was beyond his comprehension . How the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep ! He feared there must be some decided involvement . Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn . These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick . It was a child 's play , chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill 's part . With great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions . He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure . He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , \" Nonsense ! for shame ! \" He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , \" I will give it to her -- shall I?\" --and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth . \" No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . \" It was done however . This gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it . Mr. Knightley 's excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _ Dixon _ . Jane Fairfax 's perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged . She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , \" I did not know that proper names were allowed , \" pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered . Her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt . \" Aye , very true , my dear , \" cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word--\"I was just going to say the same thing . It is time for us to be going indeed . The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us . My dear sir , you are too obliging . We really must wish you good night . \" Jane 's alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived . She was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined . She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr. Knightley could not tell . He remained at Hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend-- an anxious friend -- give Emma some hint , ask her some question . He could not see her in a situation of such danger , without trying to preserve her . It was his duty . \" Pray , Emma , \" said he , \" may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ? I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . \" Emma was extremely confused . She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them . \" Oh ! \" she cried in evident embarrassment , \" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . \" \" The joke , \" he replied gravely , \" seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . \" He had hoped she would speak again , but she did not . She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak . He sat a little while in doubt . A variety of evils crossed his mind . Interference-- fruitless interference . Emma 's confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , seemed to declare her affection engaged . Yet he would speak . He owed it to her , to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference , rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing , rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause . \" My dear Emma , \" said he at last , with earnest kindness , \" do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ? \" \" Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ? Oh ! yes , perfectly.-- Why do you make a doubt of it ? \" \" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? \" \" Never , never ! \" she cried with a most open eagerness--\"Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me . And how could it possibly come into your head ? \" \" I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them-- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public . \" \" Oh ! you amuse me excessively . I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do-- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do . There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature-- it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be . That is , I _ presume _ it to be so on her side , and I can _ answer _ for its being so on his . I will answer for the gentleman 's indifference . \" She spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , Mr. Knightley . She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the where s and how s of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers . He found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking . That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse 's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [16, 17], "text": "Hartfield"}, {"position": [19, 20], "text": "Highbury"}, {"position": [468,
