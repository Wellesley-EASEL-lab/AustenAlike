{"document": "XIII Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love . Her ideas only varied as to the how much . At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little . She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring . But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _ refused _ _ him _ . Their affection was always to subside into friendship . Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part . When she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings . \" I do not find myself making any use of the word _ sacrifice _ , \" said she.-- \" In not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice . I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness . So much the better . I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do . I am quite enough in love . I should be sorry to be more . \" Upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings . \" _ He _ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed!--and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto . No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched . Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different.-- Still , however , I must be on my guard . This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man-- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable.-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily . \" When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength . It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision . No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston ; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own name was not wanting . _ Miss _ _ Woodhouse _ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed . Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words--\"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse 's beautiful little friend . Pray make my excuses and adieus to her . \" This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself . Harriet was remembered only from being _ her _ friend . His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs. Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again . Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her . Her intentions were unchanged . Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness . His recollection of Harriet , and the words which clothed it , the \" beautiful little friend , \" suggested to her the idea of Harriet 's succeeding her in his affections . Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For Harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed . \" I must not dwell upon it , \" said she.--\"I must not think of it . I know the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure . \" It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet 's behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand . As Frank Churchill 's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton 's engagement in the conversation of Highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon Frank Churchill 's disappearance , Mr. Elton 's concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.--His wedding - day was named . He would soon be among them again ; Mr. Elton and his bride . There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before \" Mr. Elton and his bride \" was in every body 's mouth , and Frank Churchill was forgotten . Emma grew sick at the sound . She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton ; and Harriet 's mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength . With Mr. Weston 's ball in view at least , there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things ; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach -- new carriage , bell - ringing , and all . Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give . Emma felt that she could not do too much for her , that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , without being able to make their opinions the same . Harriet listened submissively , and said \" it was very true-- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer \" but no change of subject could avail , and the next half - hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before . At last Emma attacked her on another ground . \" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton 's marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _ me _ . You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into . It was all my doing , I know . I have not forgotten it , I assure you.--Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you-- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . \" Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation . Emma continued , \" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . These are the motives which I have been pressing on you . They are very important -- and sorry I am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them . My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . I want you to save yourself from greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me . \" This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest . The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably . \" You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life-- Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do for you!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been ! \" Such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do , made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before . \" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart , \" said she afterwards to herself . \" There is nothing to be compared to it . Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will . It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity.-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing . Oh ! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife-- a sensible man 's wife -- it is invaluable . I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet ! \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Emma"}, {"position": [8, 9], "text": "her"}, {"position": [13, 14],
