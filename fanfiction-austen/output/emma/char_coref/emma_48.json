{"document": "XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _ first _ with Mr. Knightley , first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been.--Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella . She had herself been first with him for many years past . She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared . In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them . Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by Mr. Knightley . _ She _ could not . She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _ her _ . She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates ! How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill.-- She had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger , ) that Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _ her_.--Wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life . Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr. Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured.--Marriage , in fact , would not do for her . It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him . Nothing should separate her from her father . She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley . It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded . A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related . Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement 's becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:-- but Mr. Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for \" such things , \" he observed , \" always got about . \" Emma smiled , and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so . They had gone , in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady . She had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness . The quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene . They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them . Miss Fairfax 's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , Mrs. Weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject . Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement . Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject . \" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months , \" continued Mrs. Weston , \" she was energetic . This was one of her expressions . ` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart . \" \" Poor girl ! \" said Emma . \" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ? \" \" Wrong ! No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ` The consequence , ' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . Pain is no expiation . I never can be blameless . I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be . ' ` Do not imagine , madam , ' she continued , ` that I was taught wrong . Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell . ' \" \" Poor girl ! \" said Emma again . \" She loves him then excessively , I suppose . It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . Her affection must have overpowered her judgment . \" \" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him . \" \" I am afraid , \" returned Emma , sighing , \" that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy . \" \" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done . But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , \" she said , \" was that of making her _ unreasonable _ . The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been-- that had been -- hard for him to bear . ` I did not make the allowances , ' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits-- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ' She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . \" \" If I did not know her to be happy now , \" said Emma , seriously , \" which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks;--for , oh ! Mrs. Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten . You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . They shew her to the greatest advantage . I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . \" Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston . She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest . She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection-- but she had too much to urge for Emma 's attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs. Weston ended with , \" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , \" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for . \" Are you well , my Emma ? \" was Mrs. Weston 's parting question . \" Oh ! perfectly . I am always well , you know . Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . \" Mrs. Weston 's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax . She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause . Had she followed Mr. Knightley 's known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.--Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax 's confidence on this important matter-- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane 's feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill 's . Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst . She must have been a perpetual enemy . They never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax 's peace in a thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more . The evening of this day was very long , and melancholy , at Hartfield . The weather added what it could of gloom . A cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible . The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse , and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter 's side , and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before . It reminded her of their first forlorn tete - a - tete , on the evening of Mrs. Weston 's wedding - day ; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy . Alas ! such delightful proofs of Hartfield 's attraction , as those sort of visits conveyed , might shortly be over . The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction . The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled-- that might not be even partially brightened . If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends , Hartfield must be comparatively deserted ; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness . The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself ; and Mrs. Weston 's heart and time would be occupied by it . They should lose her ; and , probably , in great measure , her husband also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more ; and Miss Fairfax , it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to belong to Highbury . They would be married , and settled either at or near Enscombe . All that were good would be withdrawn ; and if to these losses , the loss of Donwell were to be added , what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach ? Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured ? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet 's sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet 's society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma 's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ? When it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [4, 5], "text":
