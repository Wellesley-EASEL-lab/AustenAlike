{"document": "II Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs. Bates 's youngest daughter . The marriage of Lieut . Fairfax of the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl . By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations . But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny . This was Colonel Campbell , who had very highly regarded Fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp - fever , as he believed had saved his life . These were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax , before his own return to England put any thing in his power . When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her . He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane 's age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter 's great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education . It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell 's family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time . The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell 's power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter 's ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . Such was Jane Fairfax 's history . She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education . Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell 's residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters . Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with . Neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it . The evil day was put off . It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane 's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn . This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period . With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever . The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did . As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last , had better be soon . Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished . Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment . She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter 's marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort . With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told . It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence . Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But \" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . \" These were her reasons-- she had no better . It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance . Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two . Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features-- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty . Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom . It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it:--elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury . There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit . In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on . Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon 's actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first . If it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone . She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty . Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her . These were charming feelings -- but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , \" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! \" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . Former provocations reappeared . The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again . They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance . She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious ! There was no getting at her real opinion . Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing . She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved . If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing . She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon 's character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match . It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished . It did her no service however . Her caution was thrown away . Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises . There probably _ was _ something more to conceal than her own preference ; Mr. Dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to Miss Campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds . The like reserve prevailed on other topics . She and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time . It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was . \" Was he handsome?\" --\"She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man . \" \" Was he agreeable?\" -- \" He was generally thought so . \" \" Did he appear a sensible young man ; a young man of information?\" --\"At a watering - place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill . She believed every body found his manners pleasing . \" Emma could not forgive her . III Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma . He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . \" A very pleasant evening , \" he began , as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away;--\"particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music . I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one 's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma . You left nothing undone . I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother 's , it must have been a real indulgence . \" \" I am happy you approved , \" said Emma , smiling ; \" but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield . \" \" No , my dear , \" said her father instantly ; \" _ that _ I am sure you are not . There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are . If any thing , you are too attentive . The muffin last night -- if it had been handed round once , I think it would have been enough . \" \" No , \" said Mr. Knightley , nearly at the same time ; \" you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . I think you understand me , therefore . \" An arch look expressed--\"I understand you well enough ; \" but she said only , \" Miss Fairfax is reserved . \" \" I always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence . What arises from discretion must be honoured . \" \" You think her diffident . I do not see it . \" \" My dear Emma , \" said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , \" you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . \" \" Oh ! no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained . \" \" I am disappointed , \" was his only answer . \" I hope every body had a pleasant evening , \" said Mr. Woodhouse , in his quiet way . \" I had . Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me . Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs. Bates too , in a different way . I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed . She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . \" \" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax . \" Emma saw his anxiety , and wishing to appease it , at least for the present , said , and with a sincerity which no one could question-- \" She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one 's eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . \" Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , Mr. Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the Bates 's , said-- \" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! a great pity indeed ! and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon-- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg-- do not you think so , my dear ? \" \" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter . I knew you would wish it . There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . \" \" That 's right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome . \" \" Emma , \" said Mr. Knightley presently , \" I have a piece of news for you . You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you . \" \" News ! Oh ! yes , I always like news . What is it?--why do you smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls ? \" He had time only to say , \" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls , \" when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room . Full of thanks , and full of news , Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest . Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him . \" Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse-- I come quite over - powered . Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to be married . \" Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound . \" There is my news:--I thought it would interest you , \" said Mr. Knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them . \" But where could _ you _ hear it ? \" cried Miss Bates . \" Where could you possibly hear it , Mr. Knightley ? For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole 's note -- no , it can not be more than five-- or at least ten -- for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , Jane?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ? for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen . '--`Oh ! my dear , ' said I -- well , and just then came the note . A Miss Hawkins-- that 's all I know . A Miss Hawkins of Bath . But , Mr. Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me . A Miss Hawkins-- \" \" I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago . He had just read Elton 's letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly . \" \" Well ! that is quite -- I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting . My dear sir , you really are too bountiful . My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her . \" \" We consider our Hartfield pork , \" replied Mr. Woodhouse--\"indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I can not have a greater pleasure than-- \" \" Oh ! my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us . If ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , I am sure it is us . We may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage . ' Well , Mr. Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well-- \" \" It was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course . \" -- Here was a sly glance at Emma . \" He had been so fortunate as to-- I forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them . The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins . By his style , I should imagine it just settled . \" \" Mr. Elton going to be married ! \" said Emma , as soon as she could speak . \" He will have every body 's wishes for his happiness . \" \" He is very young to settle , \" was Mr. Woodhouse 's observation . \" He had better not be in a hurry . He seemed to me very well off as he was . We were always glad to see him at Hartfield . \" \" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse ! \" said Miss Bates , joyfully ; \" my mother is so pleased!--she says she can not bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress . This is great news , indeed . Jane , you have never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him . \" Jane 's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her . \" No -- I have never seen Mr. Elton , \" she replied , starting on this appeal ; \" is he -- is he a tall man ? \" \" Who shall answer that question ? \" cried Emma . \" My father would say ` yes , ' Mr. Knightley ` no ; ' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium . When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . \" \" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry . Miss Hawkins,--I dare say , an excellent young woman . His extreme attention to my mother-- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick . Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf . He fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath-- but she says it did him no lasting benefit . Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel . And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him . It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do . Now , here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins ; and there are the Coles , such very good people ; and the Perrys -- I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry . I say , sir , \" turning to Mr. Woodhouse , \" I think there are few places with such society as Highbury . I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork-- a roast loin of pork-- \" \" As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , \" said Emma , \" nothing I suppose can be known . One feels that it can not be a very long acquaintance . He has been gone only four weeks . \" Nobody had any information to give ; and , after a few more wonderings , Emma said , \" You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell 's account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . \" \" When I have seen Mr. Elton , \" replied Jane , \" I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _ that _ with me . And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . \" \" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , \" said Miss Bates , \" four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs. Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man -- but'--In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . I do not pretend to it . What is before me , I see . At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly . She knows I would not offend for the world . How does Miss Smith do ? She seems quite recovered now . Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ? Oh ! those dear little children . Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley . I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative . \" \" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all . \" \" Very odd ! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand . One takes up a notion , and runs away with it . Mr. Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ? \" \" Handsome ! Oh ! no -- far from it -- certainly plain . I told you he was plain . \" \" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself-- \" \" Oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking . But I gave what I believed the general opinion , when I called him plain . \" \" Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away . The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole 's ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already . Thank you , we do indeed . I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _ boiled _ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . Good morning to you , my dear sir . Oh ! Mr. Knightley is coming too . Well , that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.--Mr . Elton , and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning to you . \" Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry-- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject . It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for Harriet : Harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was , by giving the first information herself , to save her from hearing it abruptly from others . It was now about the time that she was likely to call . If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard 's , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation . The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the \" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! \" which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation . As the blow was given , Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and Harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell . \" She had set out from Mrs. Goddard 's half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford's . \" --Ford 's was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher 's shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--\"And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in-- to be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's-- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!-- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think . I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh ! dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown . I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.--Oh ! dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse?) --for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _ try _ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind ! Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable ! By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think!-- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n't tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole 's stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain . Oh ! dear , I thought it would have been the death of me ! So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . And Elizabeth , too . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again . \" Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power . She was obliged to stop and think . She was not thoroughly comfortable herself . The young man 's conduct , and his sister 's , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them . As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour . But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ? It was folly to be disturbed by it . Of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry . Ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified . They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet 's acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of Harriet 's description?--So easily pleased -- so little discerning;-- what signified her praise ? She exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on , \" It might be distressing , for the moment , \" said she ; \" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never-- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . \" Harriet said , \" very true , \" and she \" would not think about it ; \" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and Emma , at last , in order to put the Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor Harriet -- such a conclusion of Mr. Elton 's importance with her ! Mr. Elton 's rights , however , gradually revived . Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy . Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting . It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock , without retaining any influence to alarm . As Harriet now lived , the Martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard 's ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech .", "clusters":
