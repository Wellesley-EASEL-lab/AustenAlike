For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet 's , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton 's nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .

Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma 's resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested her . She had frequently thought -- especially since his father 's marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _ were _ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition . He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;-- for when happily released from Mr. Elton , and seated by Mr. Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her ,"}, {"position": [1174, 1179], "text": "\" continued Mr. Weston ,"}], "Mrs. Weston": [{"position": [1246, 1247], "text": "\""}, {"position": [1281, 1282], "text": "\""}, {"position": [1546, 1547], "text": "\""}, {"position": [1562, 1566], "text": "\" replied Emma ;"}, {"position": [1596, 1597], "text": "\""}, {"position": [1754, 1831], "text": "\" Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs. Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy-- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of :"}, {"position": [1881, 1882], "text": "\""}, {"position": [1913, 1914], "text": "\""}, {"position": [2454, 2556], "text": "\" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man 's not having it in his power to do as much as that .
