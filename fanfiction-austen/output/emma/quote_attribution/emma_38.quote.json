Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . It was almost enough to make her think of marrying . Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change . Mr. Weston might be his son 's superior.-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body 's eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid . There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner . They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable . The ball proceeded pleasantly . The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston , were not thrown away . Every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this . Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . There was one , however , which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma 's wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about . He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room . Escape , however , was not his plan . He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it . He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her.-- Emma saw it . She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all . When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr. Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind - hearted , gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say"}, {"position": [3472, 3480], "text": "? \" to which his prompt reply was"}, {"position": [3494, 3495], "text": "."}, {"position": [3666, 3970], "text": ". \" Mrs. Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat . This was Mr. Elton ! the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr. Elton.-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife . She would not look again . Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot . In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again . His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced . It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles .
