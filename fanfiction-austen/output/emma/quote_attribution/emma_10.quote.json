Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her . These were charming feelings -- but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , \" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! \" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . Former provocations reappeared . The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again . They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance . She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious ! There was no getting at her real opinion . Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing . She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved . If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing . She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon 's character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match . It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished . It did her no service however . Her caution was thrown away . Emma saw its artifice , and returned"}, {"position": [2568, 2574], "text": "conceal than her own preference ;"}, {"position": [2606, 2703], "text": "pounds .
