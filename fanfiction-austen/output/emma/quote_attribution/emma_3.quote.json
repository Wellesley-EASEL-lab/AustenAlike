{"Mr. Woodhouse": [{"position": [1903, 2061], "text": "Mrs. Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs . An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome . Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body . I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you . Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _ little _ bit of tart -- a _ very _ little bit . Ours are all apple - tarts . You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here . I do not advise the custard . Mrs. Goddard , what say you to _ half _ a glass of wine ? A _ small _ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ? I do not think it could disagree with you . \""}]}
