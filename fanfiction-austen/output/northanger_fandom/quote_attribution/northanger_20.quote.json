Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber \u2014 too lofty and extensive for you , with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size \u2014 its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life , and the bed , of dark green stuff or purple velvet , presenting even a funereal appearance ?

Dorothy , meanwhile , no less struck by your appearance , gazes on you in great agitation , and drops a few unintelligible hints .

Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it , you will instantly arise , and throwing your dressing - gown around you , proceed to examine this mystery . After a very short search , you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection , and on opening it , a door will immediately appear \u2014 which door , being only secured by massy bars and a padlock , you will , after a few efforts , succeed in opening \u2014 and , with your lamp in your hand , will pass through it into a small vaulted room . \u201d"}, {"position": [2410, 2427], "text": "No , indeed ; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing . \u201d"}, {"position": [2428, 2728], "text": "What ! not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony , scarcely two miles off .

In one perhaps there may be a dagger , in another a few drops of blood , and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture ; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way , and your lamp being nearly exhausted , you will return towards your own apartment . In repassing through the small vaulted room , however , your eyes will be attracted towards a large , old - fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold , which , though narrowly examining the furniture before , you had passed unnoticed .
