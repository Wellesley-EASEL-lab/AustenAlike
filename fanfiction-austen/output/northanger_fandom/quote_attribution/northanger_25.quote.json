I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again . I shall not enter into particulars \u2014 they would only pain you more . You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God ! i am undeceived in time ! but it is a heavy blow ! after my father \u2019s consent had been so kindly given \u2014 but no more of this . She has made me miserable forever ! let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; _ your _ love I do build upon . I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced . Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much . I have written to him and my father . Her duplicity hurts me more than all ; till the very last , if I reasoned with her , she declared herself as much attached to me as ever , and laughed at my fears . I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it ; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved , I was that man . I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney . We parted at last by mutual consent \u2014 happy for me had we never met ! i can never expect to know such another woman !
