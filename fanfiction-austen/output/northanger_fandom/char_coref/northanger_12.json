{"document": "12 \u201c Mrs. Allen , \u201d said Catherine the next morning , \u201c will there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney to - day ? I shall not be easy till I have explained everything . \u201d \u201c Go , by all means , my dear ; only put on a white gown ; Miss Tilney always wears white . \u201d Catherine cheerfully complied , and being properly equipped , was more impatient than ever to be at the pump - room , that she might inform herself of General Tilney \u2019s lodgings , for though she believed they were in Milsom Street , she was not certain of the house , and Mrs. Allen \u2019s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful . To Milsom Street she was directed , and having made herself perfect in the number , hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit , explain her conduct , and be forgiven ; tripping lightly through the church - yard , and resolutely turning away her eyes , that she might not be obliged to see her beloved Isabella and her dear family , who , she had reason to believe , were in a shop hard by . She reached the house without any impediment , looked at the number , knocked at the door , and inquired for Miss Tilney . The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home , but was not quite certain . Would she be pleased to send up her name ? She gave her card . In a few minutes the servant returned , and with a look which did not quite confirm his words , said he had been mistaken , for that Miss Tilney was walked out . Catherine , with a blush of mortification , left the house . She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney _ was _ at home , and too much offended to admit her ; and as she retired down the street , could not withhold one glance at the drawing - room windows , in expectation of seeing her there , but no one appeared at them . At the bottom of the street , however , she looked back again , and then , not at a window , but issuing from the door , she saw Miss Tilney herself . She was followed by a gentleman , whom Catherine believed to be her father , and they turned up towards Edgar \u2019s Buildings . Catherine , in deep mortification , proceeded on her way . She could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility ; but she checked the resentful sensation ; she remembered her own ignorance . She knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness , to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead , nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable . Dejected and humbled , she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night ; but it must be confessed that they were not of long continuance , for she soon recollected , in the first place , that she was without any excuse for staying at home ; and , in the second , that it was a play she wanted very much to see . To the theatre accordingly they all went ; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her ; she feared that , amongst the many perfections of the family , a fondness for plays was not to be ranked ; but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the London stage , which she knew , on Isabella \u2019s authority , rendered everything else of the kind \u201c quite horrid . \u201d She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure ; the comedy so well suspended her care that no one , observing her during the first four acts , would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her . On the beginning of the fifth , however , the sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father , joining a party in the opposite box , recalled her to anxiety and distress . The stage could no longer excite genuine merriment \u2014 no longer keep her whole attention . Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box ; and , for the space of two entire scenes , did she thus watch Henry Tilney , without being once able to catch his eye . No longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play ; his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes . At length , however , he did look towards her , and he bowed \u2014 but such a bow ! no smile , no continued observance attended it ; his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction . Catherine was restlessly miserable ; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation . Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her ; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation \u2014 instead of proudly resolving , in conscious innocence , to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it , to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation , and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight , or flirting with somebody else \u2014 she took to herself all the shame of misconduct , or at least of its appearance , and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause . The play concluded \u2014 the curtain fell \u2014 Henry Tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat , but his father remained , and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box . She was right ; in a few minutes he appeared , and , making his way through the then thinning rows , spoke with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend . Not with such calmness was he answered by the latter : \u201c Oh ! mr . Tilney , I have been quite wild to speak to you , and make my apologies . You must have thought me so rude ; but indeed it was not my own fault , was it , Mrs. Allen ? Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together ? And then what could I do ? But I had ten thousand times rather have been with you ; now had not I , Mrs. Allen ? \u201d \u201c My dear , you tumble my gown , \u201d was Mrs. Allen \u2019s reply . Her assurance , however , standing sole as it did , was not thrown away ; it brought a more cordial , more natural smile into his countenance , and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve : \u201c We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in Argyle Street : you were so kind as to look back on purpose . \u201d \u201c But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk ; I never thought of such a thing ; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop ; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you ; now , Mrs. Allen , did not \u2014 Oh ! you were not there ; but indeed I did ; and , if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped , I would have jumped out and run after you . \u201d Is there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration ? Henry Tilney at least was not . With a yet sweeter smile , he said everything that need be said of his sister \u2019s concern , regret , and dependence on Catherine \u2019s honour . \u201c Oh , do not say Miss Tilney was not angry , \u201d cried Catherine , \u201c because I know she was ; for she would not see me this morning when I called ; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it ; I was hurt , but I was not affronted . Perhaps you did not know I had been there . \u201d \u201c I was not within at the time ; but I heard of it from Eleanor , and she has been wishing ever since to see you , to explain the reason of such incivility ; but perhaps I can do it as well . It was nothing more than that my father \u2014 they were just preparing to walk out , and he being hurried for time , and not caring to have it put off \u2014 made a point of her being denied . That was all , I do assure you . She was very much vexed , and meant to make her apology as soon as possible . \u201d Catherine \u2019s mind was greatly eased by this information , yet a something of solicitude remained , from which sprang the following question , thoroughly artless in itself , though rather distressing to the gentleman : \u201c But , Mr. Tilney , why were _ you _ less generous than your sister ? If she felt such confidence in my good intentions , and could suppose it to be only a mistake , why should _ you _ be so ready to take offence ? \u201d \u201c Me ! i take offence ! \u201d \u201c Nay , I am sure by your look , when you came into the box , you were angry . \u201d \u201c I angry ! i could have no right . \u201d \u201c Well , nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face . \u201d He replied by asking her to make room for him , and talking of the play . He remained with them some time , and was only too agreeable for Catherine to be contented when he went away . Before they parted , however , it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible ; and , setting aside the misery of his quitting their box , she was , upon the whole , left one of the happiest creatures in the world . While talking to each other , she had observed with some surprise that John Thorpe , who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together , was engaged in conversation with General Tilney ; and she felt something more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse . What could they have to say of her ? She feared General Tilney did not like her appearance : she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter , rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes . \u201c How came Mr. Thorpe to know your father ? \u201d was her anxious inquiry , as she pointed them out to her companion . He knew nothing about it ; but his father , like every military man , had a very large acquaintance . When the entertainment was over , Thorpe came to assist them in getting out . Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry ; and , while they waited in the lobby for a chair , he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue , by asking , in a consequential manner , whether she had seen him talking with General Tilney : \u201c He is a fine old fellow , upon my soul ! stout , active \u2014 looks as young as his son . I have a great regard for him , I assure you : a gentleman - like , good sort of fellow as ever lived . \u201d \u201c But how came you to know him ? \u201d \u201c Know him ! there are few people much about town that I do not know . I have met him forever at the Bedford ; and I knew his face again to - day the moment he came into the billiard - room . One of the best players we have , by the by ; and we had a little touch together , though I was almost afraid of him at first : the odds were five to four against me ; and , if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world \u2014 I took his ball exactly \u2014 but I could not make you understand it without a table ; however , I _ did _ beat him . A very fine fellow ; as rich as a Jew . I should like to dine with him ; I dare say he gives famous dinners . But what do you think we have been talking of ? You . Yes , by heavens ! and the General thinks you the finest girl in Bath . \u201d \u201c Oh ! nonsense ! how can you say so ? \u201d \u201c And what do you think I said?\u201d\u2014lowering his voice\u2014\u201cwell done , General , said I ; I am quite of your mind . \u201d Here Catherine , who was much less gratified by his admiration than by General Tilney \u2019s , was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen . Thorpe , however , would see her to her chair , and , till she entered it , continued the same kind of delicate flattery , in spite of her entreating him to have done . That General Tilney , instead of disliking , should admire her , was very delightful ; and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet . The evening had done more , much more , for her than could have been expected .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [7, 8], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [19, 20], "text": "my"},
