{"document": "14 The next morning was fair , and Catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled party . With Mr. Allen to support her , she felt no dread of the event : but she would gladly be spared a contest , where victory itself was painful , and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them . The Tilneys called for her at the appointed time ; and no new difficulty arising , no sudden recollection , no unexpected summons , no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their measures , my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement , though it was made with the hero himself . They determined on walking round Beechen Cliff , that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object from almost every opening in Bath . \u201c I never look at it , \u201d said Catherine , as they walked along the side of the river , \u201c without thinking of the south of France . \u201d \u201c You have been abroad then ? \u201d said Henry , a little surprised . \u201c Oh ! no , I only mean what I have read about . It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her father travelled through , in The Mysteries of Udolpho . But you never read novels , I dare say ? \u201d \u201c Why not ? \u201d \u201c Because they are not clever enough for you \u2014 gentlemen read better books . \u201d \u201c The person , be it gentleman or lady , who has not pleasure in a good novel , must be intolerably stupid . I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe \u2019s works , and most of them with great pleasure . The Mysteries of Udolpho , when I had once begun it , I could not lay down again ; I remember finishing it in two days \u2014 my hair standing on end the whole time . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d added Miss Tilney , \u201c and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me , and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note , instead of waiting for me , you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk , and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it . \u201d \u201c Thank you , Eleanor \u2014 a most honourable testimony . You see , Miss Morland , the injustice of your suspicions . Here was I , in my eagerness to get on , refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister , breaking the promise I had made of reading it aloud , and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part , by running away with the volume , which , you are to observe , was her own , particularly her own . I am proud when I reflect on it , and I think it must establish me in your good opinion . \u201d \u201c I am very glad to hear it indeed , and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself . But I really thought before , young men despised novels amazingly . \u201d \u201c It is _ amazingly ; _ it may well suggest _ amazement _ if they do \u2014 for they read nearly as many as women . I myself have read hundreds and hundreds . Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and Louisas . If we proceed to particulars , and engage in the never - ceasing inquiry of \u2018 Have you read this ? \u2019 and \u2018 Have you read that ? \u2019 I shall soon leave you as far behind me as \u2014 what shall I say?\u2014I want an appropriate simile.\u2014as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into Italy . Consider how many years I have had the start of you . I had entered on my studies at Oxford , while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home ! \u201d \u201c Not very good , I am afraid . But now really , do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world ? \u201d \u201c The nicest \u2014 by which I suppose you mean the neatest . That must depend upon the binding . \u201d \u201c Henry , \u201d said Miss Tilney , \u201c you are very impertinent . Miss Morland , he is treating you exactly as he does his sister . He is forever finding fault with me , for some incorrectness of language , and now he is taking the same liberty with you . The word \u2018 nicest , \u2019 as you used it , did not suit him ; and you had better change it as soon as you can , or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way . \u201d \u201c I am sure , \u201d cried Catherine , \u201c I did not mean to say anything wrong ; but it _ is _ a nice book , and why should not I call it so ? \u201d \u201c Very true , \u201d said Henry , \u201c and this is a very nice day , and we are taking a very nice walk , and you are two very nice young ladies . Oh ! it is a very nice word indeed ! it does for everything . Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness , propriety , delicacy , or refinement \u2014 people were nice in their dress , in their sentiments , or their choice . But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word . \u201d \u201c While , in fact , \u201d cried his sister , \u201c it ought only to be applied to you , without any commendation at all . You are more nice than wise . Come , Miss Morland , let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction , while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we like best . It is a most interesting work . You are fond of that kind of reading ? \u201d \u201c To say the truth , I do not much like any other . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! \u201d \u201c That is , I can read poetry and plays , and things of that sort , and do not dislike travels . But history , real solemn history , I can not be interested in . Can you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I am fond of history . \u201d \u201c I wish I were too . I read it a little as a duty , but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me . The quarrels of popes and kings , with wars or pestilences , in every page ; the men all so good for nothing , and hardly any women at all \u2014 it is very tiresome : and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull , for a great deal of it must be invention . The speeches that are put into the heroes \u2019 mouths , their thoughts and designs \u2014 the chief of all this must be invention , and invention is what delights me in other books . \u201d \u201c Historians , you think , \u201d said Miss Tilney , \u201c are not happy in their flights of fancy . They display imagination without raising interest . I am fond of history \u2014 and am very well contented to take the false with the true . In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records , which may be as much depended on , I conclude , as anything that does not actually pass under one \u2019s own observation ; and as for the little embellishments you speak of , they are embellishments , and I like them as such . If a speech be well drawn up , I read it with pleasure , by whomsoever it may be made \u2014 and probably with much greater , if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson , than if the genuine words of Caractacus , Agricola , or Alfred the Great . \u201d \u201c You are fond of history ! and so are Mr. Allen and my father ; and I have two brothers who do not dislike it . So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable ! at this rate , I shall not pity the writers of history any longer . If people like to read their books , it is all very well , but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes , which , as I used to think , nobody would willingly ever look into , to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate ; and though I know it is all very right and necessary , I have often wondered at the person \u2019s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . \u201d \u201c That little boys and girls should be tormented , \u201d said Henry , \u201c is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny ; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians , I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim , and that by their method and style , they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life . I use the verb \u2018 to torment , \u2019 as I observed to be your own method , instead of \u2018 to instruct , \u2019 supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous . \u201d \u201c You think me foolish to call instruction a torment , but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell , if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together , and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it , as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home , you would allow that to _ torment _ and to _ instruct _ might sometimes be used as synonymous words . \u201d \u201c Very probably . But historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read ; and even you yourself , who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe , very intense application , may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth - while to be tormented for two or three years of one \u2019s life , for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it . Consider \u2014 if reading had not been taught , Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain \u2014 or perhaps might not have written at all . \u201d Catherine assented \u2014 and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady \u2019s merits closed the subject . The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on which she had nothing to say . They were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing , and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures , with all the eagerness of real taste . Here Catherine was quite lost . She knew nothing of drawing \u2014 nothing of taste : and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little profit , for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her . The little which she could understand , however , appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before . It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of an high hill , and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of a fine day . She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance . A misplaced shame . Where people wish to attach , they should always be ignorant . To come with a well - informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others , which a sensible person would always wish to avoid . A woman especially , if she have the misfortune of knowing anything , should conceal it as well as she can . The advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author ; and to her treatment of the subject I will only add , in justice to men , that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex , imbecility in females is a great enhancement of their personal charms , there is a portion of them too reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance . But Catherine did not know her own advantages \u2014 did not know that a good - looking girl , with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind , can not fail of attracting a clever young man , unless circumstances are particularly untoward . In the present instance , she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge , declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw ; and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed , in which his instructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in everything admired by him , and her attention was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste . He talked of foregrounds , distances , and second distances \u2014 side - screens and perspectives \u2014 lights and shades ; and Catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff , she voluntarily rejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape . Delighted with her progress , and fearful of wearying her with too much wisdom at once , Henry suffered the subject to decline , and by an easy transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak which he had placed near its summit , to oaks in general , to forests , the enclosure of them , waste lands , crown lands and government , he shortly found himself arrived at politics ; and from politics , it was an easy step to silence . The general pause which succeeded his short disquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by Catherine , who , in rather a solemn tone of voice , uttered these words , \u201c I have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London . \u201d Miss Tilney , to whom this was chiefly addressed , was startled , and hastily replied , \u201c Indeed ! and of what nature ? \u201d \u201c That I do not know , nor who is the author . I have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet . \u201d \u201c Good heaven ! where could you hear of such a thing ? \u201d \u201c A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from London yesterday . It is to be uncommonly dreadful . I shall expect murder and everything of the kind . \u201d \u201c You speak with astonishing composure ! but I hope your friend \u2019s accounts have been exaggerated ; and if such a design is known beforehand , proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect . \u201d \u201c Government , \u201d said Henry , endeavouring not to smile , \u201c neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters . There must be murder ; and government cares not how much . \u201d The ladies stared . He laughed , and added , \u201c Come , shall I make you understand each other , or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can ? No \u2014 I will be noble . I will prove myself a man , no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head . I have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours . Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute \u2014 neither vigorous nor keen . Perhaps they may want observation , discernment , judgment , fire , genius , and wit . \u201d \u201c Miss Morland , do not mind what he says ; but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot . \u201d \u201c Riot ! what riot ? \u201d \u201c My dear Eleanor , the riot is only in your own brain . The confusion there is scandalous . Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out , in three duodecimo volumes , two hundred and seventy - six pages in each , with a frontispiece to the first , of two tombstones and a lantern \u2014 do you understand ? And you , Miss Morland \u2014 my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions . You talked of expected horrors in London \u2014 and instead of instantly conceiving , as any rational creature would have done , that such words could relate only to a circulating library , she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George \u2019s Fields , the Bank attacked , the Tower threatened , the streets of London flowing with blood , a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons ( the hopes of the nation ) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents , and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney , in the moment of charging at the head of his troop , knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window . Forgive her stupidity . The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman ; but she is by no means a simpleton in general . \u201d Catherine looked grave . \u201c And now , Henry , \u201d said Miss Tilney , \u201c that you have made us understand each other , you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself \u2014 unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister , and a great brute in your opinion of women in general . Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways . \u201d \u201c I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them . \u201d \u201c No doubt ; but that is no explanation of the present . \u201d \u201c What am I to do ? \u201d \u201c You know what you ought to do . Clear your character handsomely before her . Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women . \u201d \u201c Miss Morland , I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world \u2014 especially of those \u2014 whoever they may be \u2014 with whom I happen to be in company . \u201d \u201c That is not enough . Be more serious . \u201d \u201c Miss Morland , no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do . In my opinion , nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half . \u201d \u201c We shall get nothing more serious from him now , Miss Morland . He is not in a sober mood . But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood , if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all , or an unkind one of me . \u201d It was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never be wrong . His manner might sometimes surprise , but his meaning must always be just : and what she did not understand , she was almost as ready to admire , as what she did . The whole walk was delightful , and though it ended too soon , its conclusion was delightful too ; her friends attended her into the house , and Miss Tilney , before they parted , addressing herself with respectful form , as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine , petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next . No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen \u2019s side , and the only difficulty on Catherine \u2019s was in concealing the excess of her pleasure . The morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her friendship and natural affection , for no thought of Isabella or James had crossed her during their walk . When the Tilneys were gone , she became amiable again , but she was amiable for some time to little effect ; Mrs. Allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety ; she had heard nothing of any of them . Towards the end of the morning , however , Catherine , having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment \u2019s delay , walked out into the town , and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe as she was loitering towards Edgar \u2019s Buildings between two of the sweetest girls in the world , who had been her dear friends all the morning . From her , she soon learned that the party to Clifton had taken place . \u201c They set off at eight this morning , \u201d said Miss Anne , \u201c and I am sure I do not envy them their drive . I think you and I are very well off to be out of the scrape . It must be the dullest thing in the world , for there is not a soul at Clifton at this time of year . Belle went with your brother , and John drove Maria . \u201d Catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of the arrangement . \u201c Oh ! yes , \u201d rejoined the other , \u201c Maria is gone . She was quite wild to go . She thought it would be something very fine . I can not say I admire her taste ; and for my part , I was determined from the first not to go , if they pressed me ever so much . \u201d Catherine , a little doubtful of this , could not help answering , \u201c I wish you could have gone too . It is a pity you could not all go . \u201d \u201c Thank you ; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me . Indeed , I would not have gone on any account . I was saying so to Emily and Sophia when you overtook us . \u201d Catherine was still unconvinced ; but glad that Anne should have the friendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her , she bade her adieu without much uneasiness , and returned home , pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it , and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella to resent her resistance any longer .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 9], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [23, 24], "text": "her"}, {"position": [25, 26], "text":
