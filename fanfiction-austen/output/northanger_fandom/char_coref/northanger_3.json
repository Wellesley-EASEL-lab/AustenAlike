{"document": "3 Every morning now brought its regular duties \u2014 shops were to be visited ; some new part of the town to be looked at ; and the Pump - room to be attended , where they paraded up and down for an hour , looking at everybody and speaking to no one . The wish of a numerous acquaintance in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen , and she repeated it after every fresh proof , which every morning brought , of her knowing nobody at all . They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms ; and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine . The master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman - like young man as a partner ; his name was Tilney . He seemed to be about four or five and twenty , was rather tall , had a pleasing countenance , a very intelligent and lively eye , and , if not quite handsome , was very near it . His address was good , and Catherine felt herself in high luck . There was little leisure for speaking while they danced ; but when they were seated at tea , she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being . He talked with fluency and spirit \u2014 and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested , though it was hardly understood by her . After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them , he suddenly addressed her with\u2014\u201cI have hitherto been very remiss , madam , in the proper attentions of a partner here ; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath ; whether you were ever here before ; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms , the theatre , and the concert ; and how you like the place altogether . I have been very negligent \u2014 but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars ? If you are I will begin directly . \u201d \u201c You need not give yourself that trouble , sir . \u201d \u201c No trouble , I assure you , madam . \u201d Then forming his features into a set smile , and affectedly softening his voice , he added , with a simpering air , \u201c Have you been long in Bath , madam ? \u201d \u201c About a week , sir , \u201d replied Catherine , trying not to laugh . \u201c Really ! \u201d with affected astonishment . \u201c Why should you be surprised , sir ? \u201d \u201c Why , indeed ! \u201d said he , in his natural tone . \u201c But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply , and surprise is more easily assumed , and not less reasonable than any other . Now let us go on . Were you never here before , madam ? \u201d \u201c Never , sir . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir , I was there last Monday . \u201d \u201c Have you been to the theatre ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir , I was at the play on Tuesday . \u201d \u201c To the concert ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir , on Wednesday . \u201d \u201c And are you altogether pleased with Bath ? \u201d \u201c Yes \u2014 I like it very well . \u201d \u201c Now I must give one smirk , and then we may be rational again . \u201d Catherine turned away her head , not knowing whether she might venture to laugh . \u201c I see what you think of me , \u201d said he gravely\u2014\u201cI shall make but a poor figure in your journal to - morrow . \u201d \u201c My journal ! \u201d \u201c Yes , I know exactly what you will say : Friday , went to the Lower Rooms ; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings \u2014 plain black shoes \u2014 appeared to much advantage ; but was strangely harassed by a queer , half - witted man , who would make me dance with him , and distressed me by his nonsense . \u201d \u201c Indeed I shall say no such thing . \u201d \u201c Shall I tell you what you ought to say ? \u201d \u201c If you please . \u201d \u201c I danced with a very agreeable young man , introduced by Mr. King ; had a great deal of conversation with him \u2014 seems a most extraordinary genius \u2014 hope I may know more of him . _ That _ , madam , is what I _ wish _ you to say . \u201d \u201c But , perhaps , I keep no journal . \u201d \u201c Perhaps you are not sitting in this room , and I am not sitting by you . These are points in which a doubt is equally possible . Not keep a journal ! how are your absent cousins to understand the tenor of your life in Bath without one ? How are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be , unless noted down every evening in a journal ? How are your various dresses to be remembered , and the particular state of your complexion , and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities , without having constant recourse to a journal ? My dear madam , I am not so ignorant of young ladies \u2019 ways as you wish to believe me ; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated . Everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female . Nature may have done something , but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal . \u201d \u201c I have sometimes thought , \u201d said Catherine , doubtingly , \u201c whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen ! that is \u2014 I should not think the superiority was always on our side . \u201d \u201c As far as I have had opportunity of judging , it appears to me that the usual style of letter - writing among women is faultless , except in three particulars . \u201d \u201c And what are they ? \u201d \u201c A general deficiency of subject , a total inattention to stops , and a very frequent ignorance of grammar . \u201d \u201c Upon my word ! i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment . You do not think too highly of us in that way . \u201d \u201c I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men , than that they sing better duets , or draw better landscapes . In every power , of which taste is the foundation , excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes . \u201d They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen : \u201c My dear Catherine , \u201d said she , \u201c do take this pin out of my sleeve ; I am afraid it has torn a hole already ; I shall be quite sorry if it has , for this is a favourite gown , though it cost but nine shillings a yard . \u201d \u201c That is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , \u201d said Mr. Tilney , looking at the muslin . \u201c Do you understand muslins , sir ? \u201d \u201c Particularly well ; I always buy my own cravats , and am allowed to be an excellent judge ; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown . I bought one for her the other day , and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it . I gave but five shillings a yard for it , and a true Indian muslin . \u201d Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius . \u201c Men commonly take so little notice of those things , \u201d said she ; \u201c I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another . You must be a great comfort to your sister , sir . \u201d \u201c I hope I am , madam . \u201d \u201c And pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland \u2019s gown ? \u201d \u201c It is very pretty , madam , \u201d said he , gravely examining it ; \u201c but I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . \u201d \u201c How can you , \u201d said Catherine , laughing , \u201c be so \u2014 \u201d She had almost said \u201c strange . \u201d \u201c I am quite of your opinion , sir , \u201d replied Mrs. Allen ; \u201c and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . \u201d \u201c But then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak . Muslin can never be said to be wasted . I have heard my sister say so forty times , when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted , or careless in cutting it to pieces . \u201d \u201c Bath is a charming place , sir ; there are so many good shops here . We are sadly off in the country ; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury , but it is so far to go \u2014 eight miles is a long way ; Mr. Allen says it is nine , measured nine ; but I am sure it can not be more than eight ; and it is such a fag \u2014 I come back tired to death . Now , here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes . \u201d Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said ; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced . Catherine feared , as she listened to their discourse , that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others . \u201c What are you thinking of so earnestly ? \u201d said he , as they walked back to the ballroom ; \u201c not of your partner , I hope , for , by that shake of the head , your meditations are not satisfactory . \u201d Catherine coloured , and said , \u201c I was not thinking of anything . \u201d \u201c That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . \u201d \u201c Well then , I will not . \u201d \u201c Thank you ; for now we shall soon be acquainted , as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet , and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much . \u201d They danced again ; and , when the assembly closed , parted , on the lady \u2019s side at least , with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance . Whether she thought of him so much , while she drank her warm wine and water , and prepared herself for bed , as to dream of him when there , can not be ascertained ; but I hope it was no more than in a slight slumber , or a morning doze at most ; for if it be true , as a celebrated writer has maintained , that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman \u2019s love is declared,[1 ] it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her . How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen \u2019s head , but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied ; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was , and had been assured of Mr. Tilney \u2019s being a clergyman , and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire .
