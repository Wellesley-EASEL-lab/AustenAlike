{"document": "19 A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely . The result of her observations was not agreeable . Isabella seemed an altered creature . When she saw her , indeed , surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar \u2019s Buildings or Pulteney Street , her change of manners was so trifling that , had it gone no farther , it might have passed unnoticed . A something of languid indifference , or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before , would occasionally come across her ; but had nothing worse appeared , _ that _ might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest . But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney \u2019s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over . What could be meant by such unsteady conduct , what her friend could be at , was beyond her comprehension . Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting ; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent . James was the sufferer . She saw him grave and uneasy ; and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart , to _ her _ it was always an object . For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned . Though his looks did not please her , his name was a passport to her goodwill , and she thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment ; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella \u2019s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it . He might be jealous of her brother as a rival , but if more had seemed implied , the fault must have been in her misapprehension . She wished , by a gentle remonstrance , to remind Isabella of her situation , and make her aware of this double unkindness ; but for remonstrance , either opportunity or comprehension was always against her . If able to suggest a hint , Isabella could never understand it . In this distress , the intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation ; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days , and Captain Tilney \u2019s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own . But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing ; he was not to be of the party to Northanger ; he was to continue at Bath . When Catherine knew this , her resolution was directly made . She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother \u2019s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement . \u201c My brother does know it , \u201d was Henry \u2019s answer . \u201c Does he ? Then why does he stay here ? \u201d He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , \u201c Why do not you persuade him to go away ? The longer he stays , the worse it will be for him at last . Pray advise him for his own sake , and for everybody \u2019s sake , to leave Bath directly . Absence will in time make him comfortable again ; but he can have no hope here , and it is only staying to be miserable . \u201d Henry smiled and said , \u201c I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . \u201d \u201c Then you will persuade him to go away ? \u201d \u201c Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him . I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged . He knows what he is about , and must be his own master . \u201d \u201c No , he does not know what he is about , \u201d cried Catherine ; \u201c he does not know the pain he is giving my brother . Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . \u201d \u201c And are you sure it is my brother \u2019s doing ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very sure . \u201d \u201c Is it my brother \u2019s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe \u2019s admission of them , that gives the pain ? \u201d \u201c Is not it the same thing ? \u201d \u201c I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference . No man is offended by another man \u2019s admiration of the woman he loves ; it is the woman only who can make it a torment . \u201d Catherine blushed for her friend , and said , \u201c Isabella is wrong . But I am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother . She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father \u2019s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever . You know she must be attached to him . \u201d \u201c I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . \u201d \u201c Oh no , not flirts . A woman in love with one man can not flirt with another . \u201d \u201c It is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly . The gentlemen must each give up a little . \u201d After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , \u201c Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? \u201d \u201c I can have no opinion on that subject . \u201d \u201c But what can your brother mean ? If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? \u201d \u201c You are a very close questioner . \u201d \u201c Am I ? I only ask what I want to be told . \u201d \u201c But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother \u2019s heart . \u201d \u201c My brother \u2019s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . \u201d \u201c Well ? \u201d \u201c Well ! nay , if it is to be guesswork , let us all guess for ourselves . To be guided by second - hand conjecture is pitiful . The premises are before you . My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week \u2019s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . \u201d \u201c Well , \u201d said Catherine , after some moments \u2019 consideration , \u201c _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother \u2019s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not . But is not your father uncomfortable about it ? Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ? Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go . \u201d \u201c My dear Miss Morland , \u201d said Henry , \u201c in this amiable solicitude for your brother \u2019s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? Are you not carried a little too far ? Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe \u2019s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ? Is he safe only in solitude ? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ? He can not think this \u2014 and you may be sure that he would not have you think it . I will not say , \u2018 Do not be uneasy , \u2019 because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can . You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend ; depend upon it , therefore , that real jealousy never can exist between them ; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration . Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . \u201d Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , \u201c Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us . His leave of absence will soon expire , and he must return to his regiment . And what will then be their acquaintance ? The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney \u2019s passion for a month . \u201d Catherine would contend no longer against comfort . She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech , but it now carried her captive . Henry Tilney must know best . She blamed herself for the extent of her fears , and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again . Her resolution was supported by Isabella \u2019s behaviour in their parting interview . The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine \u2019s stay in Pulteney Street , and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness , or make her quit them in apprehension . James was in excellent spirits , and Isabella most engagingly placid . Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart ; but that at such a moment was allowable ; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction , and once she drew back her hand ; but Catherine remembered Henry \u2019s instructions , and placed it all to judicious affection . The embraces , tears , and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 9], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "herself"},
