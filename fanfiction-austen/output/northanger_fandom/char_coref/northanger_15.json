{"document": "15 Early the next day , a note from Isabella , speaking peace and tenderness in every line , and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance , hastened Catherine , in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity , to Edgar \u2019s Buildings . The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour ; and , on Anne \u2019s quitting it to call her sister , Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday \u2019s party . Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it ; and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world , that nobody could imagine how charming it had been , and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive . Such was the information of the first five minutes ; the second unfolded thus much in detail \u2014 that they had driven directly to the York Hotel , ate some soup , and bespoke an early dinner , walked down to the pump - room , tasted the water , and laid out some shillings in purses and spars ; thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry - cook \u2019s , and hurrying back to the hotel , swallowed their dinner in haste , to prevent being in the dark ; and then had a delightful drive back , only the moon was not up , and it rained a little , and Mr. Morland \u2019s horse was so tired he could hardly get it along . Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction . It appeared that Blaize Castle had never been thought of ; and , as for all the rest , there was nothing to regret for half an instant . Maria \u2019s intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister Anne , whom she represented as insupportably cross , from being excluded the party . \u201c She will never forgive me , I am sure ; but , you know , how could I help it ? John would have me go , for he vowed he would not drive her , because she had such thick ankles . I dare say she will not be in good humour again this month ; but I am determined I will not be cross ; it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper . \u201d Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step , and a look of such happy importance , as engaged all her friend \u2019s notice . Maria was without ceremony sent away , and Isabella , embracing Catherine , thus began : \u201c Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you . Oh , that arch eye of yours ! it sees through everything . \u201d Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance . \u201c Nay , my beloved , sweetest friend , \u201d continued the other , \u201c compose yourself . I am amazingly agitated , as you perceive . Let us sit down and talk in comfort . Well , and so you guessed it the moment you had my note ? Sly creature ! oh ! my dear Catherine , you alone , who know my heart , can judge of my present happiness . Your brother is the most charming of men . I only wish I were more worthy of him . But what will your excellent father and mother say ? Oh ! heavens ! when I think of them I am so agitated ! \u201d Catherine \u2019s understanding began to awake : an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind ; and , with the natural blush of so new an emotion , she cried out , \u201c Good heaven ! my dear Isabella , what do you mean ? Can you \u2014 can you really be in love with James ? \u201d This bold surmise , however , she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact . The anxious affection , which she was accused of having continually watched in Isabella \u2019s every look and action , had , in the course of their yesterday \u2019s party , received the delightful confession of an equal love . Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James . Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest , wonder , and joy . Her brother and her friend engaged ! new to such circumstances , the importance of it appeared unspeakably great , and she contemplated it as one of those grand events , of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return . The strength of her feelings she could not express ; the nature of them , however , contented her friend . The happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion , and the fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy . Delighting , however , as Catherine sincerely did , in the prospect of the connection , it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations . \u201c You will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland \u2019s family than to my own . \u201d This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine . \u201c You are so like your dear brother , \u201d continued Isabella , \u201c that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you . But so it always is with me ; the first moment settles everything . The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas \u2014 the very first moment I beheld him \u2014 my heart was irrecoverably gone . I remember I wore my yellow gown , with my hair done up in braids ; and when I came into the drawing - room , and John introduced him , I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before . \u201d Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love ; for , though exceedingly fond of her brother , and partial to all his endowments , she had never in her life thought him handsome . \u201c I remember too , Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening , and wore her puce - coloured sarsenet ; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her ; I could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it . Oh ! catherine , the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother \u2019s account ! i would not have you suffer half what I have done ! i am grown wretchedly thin , I know ; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety ; you have seen enough of it . I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually \u2014 so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church ! but my secret I was always sure would be safe with _ you _ . \u201d Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer ; but ashamed of an ignorance little expected , she dared no longer contest the point , nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her . Her brother , she found , was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton , to make known his situation and ask consent ; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella . Catherine endeavoured to persuade her , as she was herself persuaded , that her father and mother would never oppose their son \u2019s wishes . \u201c It is impossible , \u201d said she , \u201c for parents to be more kind , or more desirous of their children \u2019s happiness ; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately . \u201d \u201c Morland says exactly the same , \u201d replied Isabella ; \u201c and yet I dare not expect it ; my fortune will be so small ; they never can consent to it . Your brother , who might marry anybody ! \u201d Here Catherine again discerned the force of love . \u201c Indeed , Isabella , you are too humble . The difference of fortune can be nothing to signify . \u201d \u201c Oh ! my sweet Catherine , in _ your _ generous heart I know it would signify nothing ; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many . As for myself , I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed . Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . \u201d This charming sentiment , recommended as much by sense as novelty , gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance ; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea . \u201c I am sure they will consent , \u201d was her frequent declaration ; \u201c I am sure they will be delighted with you . \u201d \u201c For my own part , \u201d said Isabella , \u201c my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me . Where people are really attached , poverty itself is wealth ; grandeur I detest : I would not settle in London for the universe . A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy . There are some charming little villas about Richmond . \u201d \u201c Richmond ! \u201d cried Catherine . \u201c You must settle near Fullerton . You must be near us . \u201d \u201c I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not . If I can but be near _ you _ , I shall be satisfied . But this is idle talking ! i will not allow myself to think of such things , till we have your father \u2019s answer . Morland says that by sending it to - night to Salisbury , we may have it to - morrow . To - morrow ? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter . I know it will be the death of me . \u201d A reverie succeeded this conviction \u2014 and when Isabella spoke again , it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding - gown . Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself , who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire . Catherine wished to congratulate him , but knew not what to say , and her eloquence was only in her eyes . From them , however , the eight parts of speech shone out most expressively , and James could combine them with ease . Impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home , his adieus were not long ; and they would have been yet shorter , had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go . Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone . \u201c Indeed , Morland , I must drive you away . Consider how far you have to ride . I can not bear to see you linger so . For heaven \u2019s sake , waste no more time . There , go , go \u2014 I insist on it . \u201d The two friends , with hearts now more united than ever , were inseparable for the day ; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along . Mrs. Thorpe and her son , who were acquainted with everything , and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland \u2019s consent , to consider Isabella \u2019s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family , were allowed to join their counsels , and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters . To Catherine \u2019s simple feelings , this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant , nor consistently supported ; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out , had its inconsistency been less their friend ; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their \u201c I know what \u201d ; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit , a display of family ingenuity , on one side in the mystery of an affected secret , on the other of undefined discovery , all equally acute . Catherine was with her friend again the next day , endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters ; a needful exertion , for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near , Isabella became more and more desponding , and before the letter arrived , had worked herself into a state of real distress . But when it did come , where could distress be found ? \u201c I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents , and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness , \u201d were the first three lines , and in one moment all was joyful security . The brightest glow was instantly spread over Isabella \u2019s features , all care and anxiety seemed removed , her spirits became almost too high for control , and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals . Mrs. Thorpe , with tears of joy , embraced her daughter , her son , her visitor , and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction . Her heart was overflowing with tenderness . It was \u201c dear John \u201d and \u201c dear Catherine \u201d at every word ; \u201c dear Anne and dear Maria \u201d must immediately be made sharers in their felicity ; and two \u201c dears \u201d at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned . John himself was no skulker in joy . He not only bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world , but swore off many sentences in his praise . The letter , whence sprang all this felicity , was short , containing little more than this assurance of success ; and every particular was deferred till James could write again . But for particulars Isabella could well afford to wait . The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland \u2019s promise ; his honour was pledged to make everything easy ; and by what means their income was to be formed , whether landed property were to be resigned , or funded money made over , was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern . She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment , and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities . She saw herself at the end of a few weeks , the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at Fullerton , the envy of every valued old friend in Putney , with a carriage at her command , a new name on her tickets , and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger . When the contents of the letter were ascertained , John Thorpe , who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to London , prepared to set off . \u201c Well , Miss Morland , \u201d said he , on finding her alone in the parlour , \u201c I am come to bid you good - bye . \u201d Catherine wished him a good journey . Without appearing to hear her , he walked to the window , fidgeted about , hummed a tune , and seemed wholly self - occupied . \u201c Shall not you be late at Devizes ? \u201d said Catherine . He made no answer ; but after a minute \u2019s silence burst out with , \u201c A famous good thing this marrying scheme , upon my soul ! a clever fancy of Morland \u2019s and Belle \u2019s . What do you think of it , Miss Morland ? _ I _ say it is no bad notion . \u201d \u201c I am sure I think it a very good one . \u201d \u201c Do you ? That \u2019s honest , by heavens ! i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however . Did you ever hear the old song , \u2018 Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? \u2019 I say , you will come to Belle \u2019s wedding , I hope . \u201d \u201c Yes ; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . \u201d \u201c And then you know\u201d\u2014twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh\u2014\u201cI say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . \u201d \u201c May we ? But I never sing . Well , I wish you a good journey . I dine with Miss Tilney to - day , and must now be going home . \u201d \u201c Nay , but there is no such confounded hurry . Who knows when we may be together again ? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight , and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me . \u201d \u201c Then why do you stay away so long ? \u201d replied Catherine \u2014 finding that he waited for an answer . \u201c That is kind of you , however \u2014 kind and good - natured . I shall not forget it in a hurry . But you have more good nature and all that , than anybody living , I believe . A monstrous deal of good nature , and it is not only good nature , but you have so much , so much of everything ; and then you have such \u2014 upon my soul , I do not know anybody like you . \u201d \u201c Oh ! dear , there are a great many people like me , I dare say , only a great deal better . Good morning to you . \u201d \u201c But I say , Miss Morland , I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long , if not disagreeable . \u201d \u201c Pray do . My father and mother will be very glad to see you . \u201d \u201c And I hope \u2014 I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . \u201d \u201c Oh ! dear , not at all . There are very few people I am sorry to see . Company is always cheerful . \u201d \u201c That is just my way of thinking . Give me but a little cheerful company , let me only have the company of the people I love , let me only be where I like and with whom I like , and the devil take the rest , say I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same . But I have a notion , Miss Morland , you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters . \u201d \u201c Perhaps we may ; but it is more than I ever thought of . And as to _ most matters _ , to say the truth , there are not many that I know my own mind about . \u201d \u201c By Jove , no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me . My notion of things is simple enough . Let me only have the girl I like , say I , with a comfortable house over my head , and what care I for all the rest ? Fortune is nothing . I am sure of a good income of my own ; and if she had not a penny , why , so much the better . \u201d \u201c Very true . I think like you there . If there is a good fortune on one side , there can be no occasion for any on the other . No matter which has it , so that there is enough . I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another . And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence . Good day . We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton , whenever it is convenient . \u201d And away she went . It was not in the power of all his gallantry to detain her longer . With such news to communicate , and such a visit to prepare for , her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge ; and she hurried away , leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address , and her explicit encouragement . The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother \u2019s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in Mr. and Mrs. Allen , by the communication of the wonderful event . How great was her disappointment ! the important affair , which many words of preparation ushered in , had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother \u2019s arrival ; and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people \u2019s happiness , with a remark , on the gentleman \u2019s side , in favour of Isabella \u2019s beauty , and on the lady \u2019s , of her great good luck . It was to Catherine the most surprising insensibility . The disclosure , however , of the great secret of James \u2019s going to Fullerton the day before , did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen . She could not listen to that with perfect calmness , but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment , wished she could have known his intention , wished she could have seen him before he went , as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother , and her kind compliments to all the Skinners .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 10],
