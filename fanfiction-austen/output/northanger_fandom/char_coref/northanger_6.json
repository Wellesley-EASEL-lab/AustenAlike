{"document": "6 The following conversation , which took place between the two friends in the pump - room one morning , after an acquaintance of eight or nine days , is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment , and of the delicacy , discretion , originality of thought , and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment . They met by appointment ; and as Isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend , her first address naturally was , \u201c My dearest creature , what can have made you so late ? I have been waiting for you at least this age ! \u201d \u201c Have you , indeed ! i am very sorry for it ; but really I thought I was in very good time . It is but just one . I hope you have not been here long ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! these ten ages at least . I am sure I have been here this half hour . But now , let us go and sit down at the other end of the room , and enjoy ourselves . I have an hundred things to say to you . In the first place , I was so afraid it would rain this morning , just as I wanted to set off ; it looked very showery , and that would have thrown me into agonies ! do you know , I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine , in a shop window in Milsom Street just now \u2014 very like yours , only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green ; I quite longed for it . But , my dearest Catherine , what have you been doing with yourself all this morning ? Have you gone on with Udolpho ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I have been reading it ever since I woke ; and I am got to the black veil . \u201d \u201c Are you , indeed ? How delightful ! oh ! i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world ! are not you wild to know ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! yes , quite ; what can it be ? But do not tell me \u2014 I would not be told upon any account . I know it must be a skeleton , I am sure it is Laurentina \u2019s skeleton . Oh ! i am delighted with the book ! i should like to spend my whole life in reading it . I assure you , if it had not been to meet you , I would not have come away from it for all the world . \u201d \u201c Dear creature ! how much I am obliged to you ; and when you have finished Udolpho , we will read the Italian together ; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you . \u201d \u201c Have you , indeed ! how glad I am ! what are they all ? \u201d \u201c I will read you their names directly ; here they are , in my pocketbook . Castle of Wolfenbach , Clermont , Mysterious Warnings , Necromancer of the Black Forest , Midnight Bell , Orphan of the Rhine , and Horrid Mysteries . Those will last us some time . \u201d \u201c Yes , pretty well ; but are they all horrid , are you sure they are all horrid ? \u201d \u201c Yes , quite sure ; for a particular friend of mine , a Miss Andrews , a sweet girl , one of the sweetest creatures in the world , has read every one of them . I wish you knew Miss Andrews , you would be delighted with her . She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive . I think her as beautiful as an angel , and I am so vexed with the men for not admiring her ! i scold them all amazingly about it . \u201d \u201c Scold them ! do you scold them for not admiring her ? \u201d \u201c Yes , that I do . There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends . I have no notion of loving people by halves ; it is not my nature . My attachments are always excessively strong . I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night , I would not dance with him , unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel . The men think us incapable of real friendship , you know , and I am determined to show them the difference . Now , if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you , I should fire up in a moment : but that is not at all likely , for _ you _ are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men . \u201d \u201c Oh , dear ! \u201d cried Catherine , colouring . \u201c How can you say so ? \u201d \u201c I know you very well ; you have so much animation , which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants , for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her . Oh ! i must tell you , that just after we parted yesterday , I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly \u2014 I am sure he is in love with you . \u201d Catherine coloured , and disclaimed again . Isabella laughed . \u201c It is very true , upon my honour , but I see how it is ; you are indifferent to everybody \u2019s admiration , except that of one gentleman , who shall be nameless . Nay , I can not blame you\u201d\u2014speaking more seriously\u2014\u201cyour feelings are easily understood . Where the heart is really attached , I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else . Everything is so insipid , so uninteresting , that does not relate to the beloved object ! i can perfectly comprehend your feelings . \u201d \u201c But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney , for perhaps I may never see him again . \u201d \u201c Not see him again ! my dearest creature , do not talk of it . I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so ! \u201d \u201c No , indeed , I should not . I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him ; but while I have Udolpho to read , I feel as if nobody could make me miserable . Oh ! the dreadful black veil ! my dear Isabella , I am sure there must be Laurentina \u2019s skeleton behind it . \u201d \u201c It is so odd to me , that you should never have read Udolpho before ; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels . \u201d \u201c No , she does not . She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself ; but new books do not fall in our way . \u201d \u201c Sir Charles Grandison ! that is an amazing horrid book , is it not ? I remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume . \u201d \u201c It is not like Udolpho at all ; but yet I think it is very entertaining . \u201d \u201c Do you indeed ! you surprise me ; I thought it had not been readable . But , my dearest Catherine , have you settled what to wear on your head to - night ? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you . The men take notice of _ that _ sometimes , you know . \u201d \u201c But it does not signify if they do , \u201d said Catherine , very innocently . \u201c Signify ! oh , heavens ! i make it a rule never to mind what they say . They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit , and make them keep their distance . \u201d \u201c Are they ? Well , I never observed _ that _ . They always behave very well to me . \u201d \u201c Oh ! they give themselves such airs . They are the most conceited creatures in the world , and think themselves of so much importance ! by the by , though I have thought of it a hundred times , I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man . Do you like them best dark or fair ? \u201d \u201c I hardly know . I never much thought about it . Something between both , I think . Brown \u2014 not fair , and \u2014 and not very dark . \u201d \u201c Very well , Catherine . That is exactly he . I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney\u2014\u2018a brown skin , with dark eyes , and rather dark hair . \u2019 Well , my taste is different . I prefer light eyes , and as to complexion \u2014 do you know \u2014 I like a sallow better than any other . You must not betray me , if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description . \u201d \u201c Betray you ! what do you mean ? \u201d \u201c Nay , do not distress me . I believe I have said too much . Let us drop the subject . \u201d Catherine , in some amazement , complied , and after remaining a few moments silent , was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world , Laurentina \u2019s skeleton , when her friend prevented her , by saying , \u201c For heaven \u2019s sake ! Let us move away from this end of the room . Do you know , there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour . They really put me quite out of countenance . Let us go and look at the arrivals . They will hardly follow us there . \u201d Away they walked to the book ; and while Isabella examined the names , it was Catherine \u2019s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men . \u201c They are not coming this way , are they ? I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us . Pray let me know if they are coming . I am determined I will not look up . \u201d In a few moments Catherine , with unaffected pleasure , assured her that she need not be longer uneasy , as the gentlemen had just left the pump - room . \u201c And which way are they gone ? \u201d said Isabella , turning hastily round . \u201c One was a very good - looking young man . \u201d \u201c They went towards the church - yard . \u201d \u201c Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them ! and now , what say you to going to Edgar \u2019s Buildings with me , and looking at my new hat ? You said you should like to see it . \u201d Catherine readily agreed . \u201c Only , \u201d she added , \u201c perhaps we may overtake the two young men . \u201d \u201c Oh ! never mind that . If we make haste , we shall pass by them presently , and I am dying to show you my hat . \u201d \u201c But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . \u201d \u201c I shall not pay them any such compliment , I assure you . I have no notion of treating men with such respect . _ That _ is the way to spoil them . \u201d Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning ; and therefore , to show the independence of Miss Thorpe , and her resolution of humbling the sex , they set off immediately as fast as they could walk , in pursuit of the two young men .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [69, 70],
