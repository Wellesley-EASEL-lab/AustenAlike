{"document": "7 Half a minute conducted them through the pump - yard to the archway , opposite Union Passage ; but here they were stopped . Everybody acquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street at this point ; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature , so unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads , and the principal inn of the city , that a day never passes in which parties of ladies , however important their business , whether in quest of pastry , millinery , or even ( as in the present case ) of young men , are not detained on one side or other by carriages , horsemen , or carts . This evil had been felt and lamented , at least three times a day , by Isabella since her residence in Bath ; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more , for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage , and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds , and threading the gutters of that interesting alley , they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig , driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing - looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself , his companion , and his horse . \u201c Oh , these odious gigs ! \u201d said Isabella , looking up . \u201c How I detest them . \u201d But this detestation , though so just , was of short duration , for she looked again and exclaimed , \u201c Delightful ! mr . Morland and my brother ! \u201d \u201c Good heaven ! \u2019 Tis James ! \u201d was uttered at the same moment by Catherine ; and , on catching the young men \u2019s eyes , the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches , and the servant having now scampered up , the gentlemen jumped out , and the equipage was delivered to his care . Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people \u2019s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself . John Thorpe , who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses , soon joined them , and from him she directly received the amends which were her due ; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella , on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow . He was a stout young man of middling height , who , with a plain face and ungraceful form , seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom , and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil , and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy . He took out his watch : \u201c How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury , Miss Morland ? \u201d \u201c I do not know the distance . \u201d Her brother told her that it was twenty - three miles . \u201c _ Three_-and - twenty ! \u201d cried Thorpe , \u201c five - and - twenty if it is an inch . \u201d Morland remonstrated , pleaded the authority of road - books , innkeepers , and milestones ; but his friend disregarded them all ; he had a surer test of distance . \u201c I know it must be five - and - twenty , \u201d said he , \u201c by the time we have been doing it . It is now half after one ; we drove out of the inn - yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven ; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness ; that makes it exactly twenty - five . \u201d \u201c You have lost an hour , \u201d said Morland ; \u201c it was only ten o\u2019clock when we came from Tetbury . \u201d \u201c Ten o\u2019clock ! it was eleven , upon my soul ! i counted every stroke . This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses , Miss Morland ; do but look at my horse ; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life ? \u201d ( The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving off . ) \u201c Such true blood ! three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles ! look at that creature , and suppose it possible if you can . \u201d \u201c He _ does _ look very hot , to be sure . \u201d \u201c Hot ! he had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church ; but look at his forehand ; look at his loins ; only see how he moves ; that horse _ can not _ go less than ten miles an hour : tie his legs and he will get on . What do you think of my gig , Miss Morland ? A neat one , is not it ? Well hung ; town - built ; I have not had it a month . It was built for a Christchurch man , a friend of mine , a very good sort of fellow ; he ran it a few weeks , till , I believe , it was convenient to have done with it . I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind , though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too ; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge , as he was driving into Oxford , last term : \u2018 Ah ! thorpe , \u2019 said he , \u2018 do you happen to want such a little thing as this ? It is a capital one of the kind , but I am cursed tired of it . \u2019 \u2018 Oh ! d \u2014 , \u2019 said I ; \u2018 I am your man ; what do you ask ? \u2019 And how much do you think he did , Miss Morland ? \u201d \u201c I am sure I can not guess at all . \u201d \u201c Curricle - hung , you see ; seat , trunk , sword - case , splashing - board , lamps , silver moulding , all you see complete ; the iron - work as good as new , or better . He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . \u201d \u201c And I am sure , \u201d said Catherine , \u201c I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . \u201d \u201c Neither one nor t\u2019other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . \u201d \u201c That was very good - natured of you , \u201d said Catherine , quite pleased . \u201c Oh ! d \u2014 \u2014 it , when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend , I hate to be pitiful . \u201d An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young ladies ; and , on finding whither they were going , it was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar \u2019s Buildings , and pay their respects to Mrs. Thorpe . James and Isabella led the way ; and so well satisfied was the latter with her lot , so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother \u2019s friend , and her friend \u2019s brother , so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings , that , though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street , she was so far from seeking to attract their notice , that she looked back at them only three times . John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine , and , after a few minutes \u2019 silence , renewed the conversation about his gig . \u201c You will find , however , Miss Morland , it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people , for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day ; Jackson , of Oriel , bid me sixty at once ; Morland was with me at the time . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d said Morland , who overheard this ; \u201c but you forget that your horse was included . \u201d \u201c My horse ! oh , d \u2014 \u2014 it ! i would not sell my horse for a hundred . Are you fond of an open carriage , Miss Morland ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very ; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one ; but I am particularly fond of it . \u201d \u201c I am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . \u201d \u201c Thank you , \u201d said Catherine , in some distress , from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer . \u201c I will drive you up Lansdown Hill to - morrow . \u201d \u201c Thank you ; but will not your horse want rest ? \u201d \u201c Rest ! he has only come three and twenty miles to - day ; all nonsense ; nothing ruins horses so much as rest ; nothing knocks them up so soon . No , no ; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here . \u201d \u201c Shall you indeed ! \u201d said Catherine very seriously . \u201c That will be forty miles a day . \u201d \u201c Forty ! aye , fifty , for what I care . Well , I will drive you up Lansdown to - morrow ; mind , I am engaged . \u201d \u201c How delightful that will be ! \u201d cried Isabella , turning round . \u201c My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother , you will not have room for a third . \u201d \u201c A third indeed ! no , no ; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about ; that would be a good joke , faith ! morland must take care of you . \u201d This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two ; but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result . Her companion \u2019s discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met ; and Catherine , after listening and agreeing as long as she could , with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind , fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self - assured man , especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned , ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts ; it was , \u201c Have you ever read Udolpho , Mr. Thorpe ? \u201d \u201c Udolpho ! oh , Lord ! not I ; I never read novels ; I have something else to do . \u201d Catherine , humbled and ashamed , was going to apologize for her question , but he prevented her by saying , \u201c Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff ; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones , except The Monk ; I read that t\u2019other day ; but as for all the others , they are the stupidest things in creation . \u201d \u201c I think you must like Udolpho , if you were to read it ; it is so very interesting . \u201d \u201c Not I , faith ! no , if I read any , it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe \u2019s ; her novels are amusing enough ; they are worth reading ; some fun and nature in _ them _ . \u201d \u201c Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe , \u201d said Catherine , with some hesitation , from the fear of mortifying him . \u201c No , sure ; was it ? Aye , I remember , so it was ; I was thinking of that other stupid book , written by that woman they make such a fuss about , she who married the French emigrant . \u201d \u201c I suppose you mean Camilla ? \u201d \u201c Yes , that \u2019s the book ; such unnatural stuff ! an old man playing at see - saw , I took up the first volume once and looked it over , but I soon found it would not do ; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it : as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant , I was sure I should never be able to get through it . \u201d \u201c I have never read it . \u201d \u201c You had no loss , I assure you ; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine ; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man \u2019s playing at see - saw and learning Latin ; upon my soul there is not . \u201d This critique , the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine , brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe \u2019s lodgings , and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son , as they met Mrs. Thorpe , who had descried them from above , in the passage . \u201c Ah , Mother ! How do you do ? \u201d said he , giving her a hearty shake of the hand . \u201c Where did you get that quiz of a hat ? It makes you look like an old witch . Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you , so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near . \u201d And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother \u2019s heart , for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection . On his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness , for he asked each of them how they did , and observed that they both looked very ugly . These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James \u2019s friend and Isabella \u2019s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella \u2019s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John \u2019s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening . Had she been older or vainer , such attacks might have done little ; but , where youth and diffidence are united , it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world , and of being so very early engaged as a partner ; and the consequence was that , when the two Morlands , after sitting an hour with the Thorpes , set off to walk together to Mr. Allen \u2019s , and James , as the door was closed on them , said , \u201c Well , Catherine , how do you like my friend Thorpe ? \u201d instead of answering , as she probably would have done , had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case , \u201c I do not like him at all , \u201d she directly replied , \u201c I like him very much ; he seems very agreeable . \u201d \u201c He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? \u201d \u201c Very , very much indeed : Isabella particularly . \u201d \u201c I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you . She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be ; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you , Catherine , \u201d taking her hand with affection , \u201c may be proud of . \u201d \u201c Indeed I am , \u201d she replied ; \u201c I love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too . You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . \u201d \u201c Because I thought I should soon see you myself . I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath . She is a most amiable girl ; such a superior understanding ! how fond all the family are of her ; she is evidently the general favourite ; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this \u2014 is not she ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very much indeed , I fancy ; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath . \u201d \u201c I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very kind ; I never was so happy before ; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever ; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _ me _ . \u201d James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , \u201c Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . \u201d Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James \u2019s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet . A pre - engagement in Edgar \u2019s Buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend , and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other . The time of the two parties uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted , Catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised , restless , and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho , lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner , incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen \u2019s fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker , and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity , in being already engaged for the evening .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [313, 316], "text": "the young men"}, {"position": [343, 345], "text": "the
