{"document": "4 With more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump - room the next day , secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning were over , and ready to meet him with a smile ; but no smile was demanded \u2014 Mr. Tilney did not appear . Every creature in Bath , except himself , was to be seen in the room at different periods of the fashionable hours ; crowds of people were every moment passing in and out , up the steps and down ; people whom nobody cared about , and nobody wanted to see ; and he only was absent . \u201c What a delightful place Bath is , \u201d said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock , after parading the room till they were tired ; \u201c and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here . \u201d This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now ; but we are told to \u201c despair of nothing we would attain , \u201d as \u201c unwearied diligence our point would gain \u201d ; and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward , for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age , who was sitting by her , and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes , addressed her with great complaisance in these words : \u201c I think , madam , I can not be mistaken ; it is a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing you , but is not your name Allen ? \u201d This question answered , as it readily was , the stranger pronounced hers to be Thorpe ; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate , whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages , and that many years ago . Their joy on this meeting was very great , as well it might , since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years . Compliments on good looks now passed ; and , after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together , how little they had thought of meeting in Bath , and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend , they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families , sisters , and cousins , talking both together , far more ready to give than to receive information , and each hearing very little of what the other said . Mrs. Thorpe , however , had one great advantage as a talker , over Mrs. Allen , in a family of children ; and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons , and the beauty of her daughters , when she related their different situations and views \u2014 that John was at Oxford , Edward at Merchant Taylors \u2019 , and William at sea \u2014 and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were , Mrs. Allen had no similar information to give , no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend , and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions , consoling herself , however , with the discovery , which her keen eyes soon made , that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe \u2019s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own . \u201c Here come my dear girls , \u201d cried Mrs. Thorpe , pointing at three smart - looking females who , arm in arm , were then moving towards her . \u201c My dear Mrs. Allen , I long to introduce them ; they will be so delighted to see you : the tallest is Isabella , my eldest ; is not she a fine young woman ? The others are very much admired too , but I believe Isabella is the handsomest . \u201d The Miss Thorpes were introduced ; and Miss Morland , who had been for a short time forgotten , was introduced likewise . The name seemed to strike them all ; and , after speaking to her with great civility , the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest , \u201c How excessively like her brother Miss Morland is ! \u201d \u201c The very picture of him indeed ! \u201d cried the mother \u2014 and \u201c I should have known her anywhere for his sister ! \u201d was repeated by them all , two or three times over . For a moment Catherine was surprised ; but Mrs. Thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with Mr. James Morland , before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college , of the name of Thorpe ; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmas vacation with his family , near London . The whole being explained , many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her ; of being considered as already friends , through the friendship of their brothers , etc . , which Catherine heard with pleasure , and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command ; and , as the first proof of amity , she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe , and take a turn with her about the room . Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance , and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe . Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love . Their conversation turned upon those subjects , of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies : such as dress , balls , flirtations , and quizzes . Miss Thorpe , however , being four years older than Miss Morland , and at least four years better informed , had a very decided advantage in discussing such points ; she could compare the balls of Bath with those of Tunbridge , its fashions with the fashions of London ; could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire ; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other ; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd . These powers received due admiration from Catherine , to whom they were entirely new ; and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity , had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe \u2019s manners , and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her , softened down every feeling of awe , and left nothing but tender affection . Their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump - room , but required , when they all quitted it together , that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen \u2019s house ; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands , after learning , to their mutual relief , that they should see each other across the theatre at night , and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning . Catherine then ran directly upstairs , and watched Miss Thorpe \u2019s progress down the street from the drawing - room window ; admired the graceful spirit of her walk , the fashionable air of her figure and dress ; and felt grateful , as well she might , for the chance which had procured her such a friend . Mrs. Thorpe was a widow , and not a very rich one ; she was a good - humoured , well - meaning woman , and a very indulgent mother . Her eldest daughter had great personal beauty , and the younger ones , by pretending to be as handsome as their sister , imitating her air , and dressing in the same style , did very well . This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself , of her past adventures and sufferings , which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters ; in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth , and conversations , which had passed twenty years before , be minutely repeated
