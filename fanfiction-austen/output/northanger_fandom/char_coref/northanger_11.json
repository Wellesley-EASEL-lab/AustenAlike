{"document": "11 The morrow brought a very sober - looking morning , the sun making only a few efforts to appear , and Catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes . A bright morning so early in the year , she allowed , would generally turn to rain , but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced . She applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of her hopes , but Mr. Allen , not having his own skies and barometer about him , declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine . She applied to Mrs. Allen , and Mrs. Allen \u2019s opinion was more positive . \u201c She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day , if the clouds would only go off , and the sun keep out . \u201d At about eleven o\u2019clock , however , a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine \u2019s watchful eye , and \u201c Oh ! dear , I do believe it will be wet , \u201d broke from her in a most desponding tone . \u201c I thought how it would be , \u201d said Mrs. Allen . \u201c No walk for me to - day , \u201d sighed Catherine ; \u201c but perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . \u201d \u201c Perhaps it may , but then , my dear , it will be so dirty . \u201d \u201c Oh ! that will not signify ; I never mind dirt . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d replied her friend very placidly , \u201c I know you never mind dirt . \u201d After a short pause , \u201c It comes on faster and faster ! \u201d said Catherine , as she stood watching at a window . \u201c So it does indeed . If it keeps raining , the streets will be very wet . \u201d \u201c There are four umbrellas up already . How I hate the sight of an umbrella ! \u201d \u201c They are disagreeable things to carry . I would much rather take a chair at any time . \u201d \u201c It was such a nice - looking morning ! i felt so convinced it would be dry ! \u201d \u201c Anybody would have thought so indeed . There will be very few people in the pump - room , if it rains all the morning . I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable . \u201d The rain continued \u2014 fast , though not heavy . Catherine went every five minutes to the clock , threatening on each return that , if it still kept on raining another five minutes , she would give up the matter as hopeless . The clock struck twelve , and it still rained . \u201c You will not be able to go , my dear . \u201d \u201c I do not quite despair yet . I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve . This is just the time of day for it to clear up , and I do think it looks a little lighter . There , it is twenty minutes after twelve , and now I _ shall _ give it up entirely . Oh ! that we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho , or at least in Tuscany and the south of France!\u2014the night that poor St. Aubin died!\u2014such beautiful weather ! \u201d At half past twelve , when Catherine \u2019s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment , the sky began voluntarily to clear . A gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise ; she looked round ; the clouds were parting , and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance . Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed , and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen , who had \u201c always thought it would clear up . \u201d But whether Catherine might still expect her friends , whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture , must yet be a question . It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump - room ; he accordingly set off by himself , and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages , containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back . \u201c Isabella , my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare ! they are coming for me perhaps \u2014 but I shall not go \u2014 I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . \u201d Mrs. Allen agreed to it . John Thorpe was soon with them , and his voice was with them yet sooner , for on the stairs he was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick . \u201c Make haste ! make haste ! \u201d as he threw open the door . \u201c Put on your hat this moment \u2014 there is no time to be lost \u2014 we are going to Bristol . How d\u2019ye do , Mrs. Allen ? \u201d \u201c To Bristol ! is not that a great way off ? But , however , I can not go with you to - day , because I am engaged ; I expect some friends every moment . \u201d This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all ; Mrs. Allen was called on to second him , and the two others walked in , to give their assistance . \u201c My sweetest Catherine , is not this delightful ? We shall have a most heavenly drive . You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme ; it darted into our heads at breakfast - time , I verily believe at the same instant ; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain . But it does not signify , the nights are moonlight , and we shall do delightfully . Oh ! i am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet ! so much better than going to the Lower Rooms . We shall drive directly to Clifton and dine there ; and , as soon as dinner is over , if there is time for it , go on to Kingsweston . \u201d \u201c I doubt our being able to do so much , \u201d said Morland . \u201c You croaking fellow ! \u201d cried Thorpe . \u201c We shall be able to do ten times more . Kingsweston ! aye , and Blaize Castle too , and anything else we can hear of ; but here is your sister says she will not go . \u201d \u201c Blaize Castle ! \u201d cried Catherine . \u201c What is that ? \u201d \u201c The finest place in England \u2014 worth going fifty miles at any time to see . \u201d \u201c What , is it really a castle , an old castle ? \u201d \u201c The oldest in the kingdom . \u201d \u201c But is it like what one reads of ? \u201d \u201c Exactly \u2014 the very same . \u201d \u201c But now really \u2014 are there towers and long galleries ? \u201d \u201c By dozens . \u201d \u201c Then I should like to see it ; but I cannot \u2014 I can not go . \u201d \u201c Not go ! my beloved creature , what do you mean ? \u201d \u201c I can not go , because\u201d\u2014looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella \u2019s smile\u2014\u201cI expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk . They promised to come at twelve , only it rained ; but now , as it is so fine , I dare say they will be here soon . \u201d \u201c Not they indeed , \u201d cried Thorpe ; \u201c for , as we turned into Broad Street , I saw them \u2014 does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts ? \u201d \u201c I do not know indeed . \u201d \u201c Yes , I know he does ; I saw him . You are talking of the man you danced with last night , are not you ? \u201d \u201c Yes . \u201d \u201c Well , I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road , driving a smart - looking girl . \u201d \u201c Did you indeed ? \u201d \u201c Did upon my soul ; knew him again directly , and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too . \u201d \u201c It is very odd ! but I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk . \u201d \u201c And well they might , for I never saw so much dirt in my life . Walk ! You could no more walk than you could fly ! it has not been so dirty the whole winter ; it is ankle - deep everywhere . \u201d Isabella corroborated it : \u201c My dearest Catherine , you can not form an idea of the dirt ; come , you must go ; you can not refuse going now . \u201d \u201c I should like to see the castle ; but may we go all over it ? May we go up every staircase , and into every suite of rooms ? \u201d \u201c Yes , yes , every hole and corner . \u201d \u201c But then , if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer , and call by and by ? \u201d \u201c Make yourself easy , there is no danger of that , for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback , that they were going as far as Wick Rocks . \u201d \u201c Then I will . Shall I go , Mrs. Allen ? \u201d \u201c Just as you please , my dear . \u201d \u201c Mrs. Allen , you must persuade her to go , \u201d was the general cry . Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it : \u201c Well , my dear , \u201d said she , \u201c suppose you go . \u201d And in two minutes they were off . Catherine \u2019s feelings , as she got into the carriage , were in a very unsettled state ; divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure , and the hope of soon enjoying another , almost its equal in degree , however unlike in kind . She could not think the Tilneys had acted quite well by her , in so readily giving up their engagement , without sending her any message of excuse . It was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk ; and , in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour , she could not from her own observation help thinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience . To feel herself slighted by them was very painful . On the other hand , the delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho , as her fancy represented Blaize Castle to be , was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost anything . They passed briskly down Pulteney Street , and through Laura Place , without the exchange of many words . Thorpe talked to his horse , and she meditated , by turns , on broken promises and broken arches , phaetons and false hangings , Tilneys and trap - doors . As they entered Argyle Buildings , however , she was roused by this address from her companion , \u201c Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by ? \u201d \u201c Who ? Where ? \u201d \u201c On the right - hand pavement \u2014 she must be almost out of sight now . \u201d Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother \u2019s arm , walking slowly down the street . She saw them both looking back at her . \u201c Stop , stop , Mr. Thorpe , \u201d she impatiently cried ; \u201c it is Miss Tilney ; it is indeed . How could you tell me they were gone ? Stop , stop , I will get out this moment and go to them . \u201d But to what purpose did she speak ? Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot ; the Tilneys , who had soon ceased to look after her , were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place , and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace . Still , however , and during the length of another street , she entreated him to stop . \u201c Pray , pray stop , Mr. Thorpe . I can not go on . I will not go on . I must go back to Miss Tilney . \u201d But Mr. Thorpe only laughed , smacked his whip , encouraged his horse , made odd noises , and drove on ; and Catherine , angry and vexed as she was , having no power of getting away , was obliged to give up the point and submit . Her reproaches , however , were not spared . \u201c How could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road ? I would not have had it happen so for the world . They must think it so strange , so rude of me ! to go by them , too , without saying a word ! you do not know how vexed I am ; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton , nor in anything else . I had rather , ten thousand times rather , get out now , and walk back to them . How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton ? \u201d Thorpe defended himself very stoutly , declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life , and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself . Their drive , even when this subject was over , was not likely to be very agreeable . Catherine \u2019s complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing . She listened reluctantly , and her replies were short . Blaize Castle remained her only comfort ; towards _ that _ , she still looked at intervals with pleasure ; though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk , and especially rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys , she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its walls could supply \u2014 the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms , exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture , though now for many years deserted \u2014 the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow , winding vaults , by a low , grated door ; or even of having their lamp , their only lamp , extinguished by a sudden gust of wind , and of being left in total darkness . In the meanwhile , they proceeded on their journey without any mischance , and were within view of the town of Keynsham , when a halloo from Morland , who was behind them , made his friend pull up , to know what was the matter . The others then came close enough for conversation , and Morland said , \u201c We had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on to - day ; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street , very little more than seven miles ; and , I suppose , we have at least eight more to go . It will never do . We set out a great deal too late . We had much better put it off till another day , and turn round . \u201d \u201c It is all one to me , \u201d replied Thorpe rather angrily ; and instantly turning his horse , they were on their way back to Bath . \u201c If your brother had not got such a d \u2014 \u2014 beast to drive , \u201d said he soon afterwards , \u201c we might have done it very well . My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour , if left to himself , and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken - winded jade \u2019s pace . Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own . \u201d \u201c No , he is not , \u201d said Catherine warmly , \u201c for I am sure he could not afford it . \u201d \u201c And why can not he afford it ? \u201d \u201c Because he has not money enough . \u201d \u201c And whose fault is that ? \u201d \u201c Nobody \u2019s , that I know of . \u201d Thorpe then said something in the loud , incoherent way to which he had often recourse , about its being a d \u2014 \u2014 thing to be miserly ; and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things , he did not know who could , which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand . Disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment , she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so ; and they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words . As she entered the house , the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off ; that , when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe , the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her ; and on his saying no , had felt for a card , but said she had none about her , and went away . Pondering over these heart - rending tidings , Catherine walked slowly upstairs . At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , \u201c I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . It was a strange , wild scheme . \u201d They all spent the evening together at Thorpe \u2019s . Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits ; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce , in the fate of which she shared , by private partnership with Morland , a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton . Her satisfaction , too , in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once . \u201c How I pity the poor creatures that are going there ! how glad I am that I am not amongst them ! i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not ! they have not begun dancing yet . I would not be there for all the world . It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself . I dare say it will not be a very good ball . I know the Mitchells will not be there . I am sure I pity everybody that is . But I dare say , Mr. Morland , you long to be at it , do not you ? I am sure you do . Well , pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you . I dare say we could do very well without you ; but you men think yourselves of such consequence . \u201d Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows , so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind , and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered . \u201c Do not be so dull , my dearest creature , \u201d she whispered . \u201c You will quite break my heart . It was amazingly shocking , to be sure ; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame . Why were not they more punctual ? It was dirty , indeed , but what did that signify ? I am sure John and I should not have minded it . I never mind going through anything , where a friend is concerned ; that is my disposition , and John is just the same ; he has amazing strong feelings . Good heavens ! what a delightful hand you have got ! kings , I vow ! i never was so happy in my life ! i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself . \u201d And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch , which is the true heroine \u2019s portion ; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears . And lucky may she think herself , if she get another good night \u2019s rest in the course of the next three months .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [22, 23], "text": "Catherine"},
