{"document": "24 The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments . It was Sunday , and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the General in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home ; and great as was Catherine \u2019s curiosity , her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner , either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o\u2019clock , or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp . The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney , which immediately fronted the family pew . By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained ; and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph , in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband , who must have been in some way or other her destroyer , affected her even to tears . That the General , having erected such a monument , should be able to face it , was not perhaps very strange , and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view , maintain so elevated an air , look so fearlessly around , nay , that he should even enter the church , seemed wonderful to Catherine . Not , however , that many instances of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced . She could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice , going on from crime to crime , murdering whomsoever they chose , without any feeling of humanity or remorse ; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career . The erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney \u2019s actual decease . Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber , were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed \u2014 what could it avail in such a case ? Catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced , and a supposititious funeral carried on . The succeeding morning promised something better . The General \u2019s early walk , ill - timed as it was in every other view , was favourable here ; and when she knew him to be out of the house , she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise . Eleanor was ready to oblige her ; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise , their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed - chamber . It represented a very lovely woman , with a mild and pensive countenance , justifying , so far , the expectations of its new observer ; but they were not in every respect answered , for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features , hair , complexion , that should be the very counterpart , the very image , if not of Henry \u2019s , of Eleanor\u2019s \u2014 the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking , bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child . A face once taken was taken for generations . But here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness . She contemplated it , however , in spite of this drawback , with much emotion , and , but for a yet stronger interest , would have left it unwillingly . Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse ; she could only look at her companion . Eleanor \u2019s countenance was dejected , yet sedate ; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing . Again she passed through the folding doors , again her hand was upon the important lock , and Catherine , hardly able to breathe , was turning to close the former with fearful caution , when the figure , the dreaded figure of the General himself at the further end of the gallery , stood before her ! the name of \u201c Eleanor \u201d at the same moment , in his loudest tone , resounded through the building , giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence , and to Catherine terror upon terror . An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him , yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye ; and when her friend , who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her , had joined and disappeared with him , she ran for safety to her own room , and , locking herself in , believed that she should never have courage to go down again . She remained there at least an hour , in the greatest agitation , deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend , and expecting a summons herself from the angry General to attend him in his own apartment . No summons , however , arrived ; and at last , on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey , she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors . The breakfast - room was gay with company ; and she was named to them by the General as the friend of his daughter , in a complimentary style , which so well concealed his resentful ire , as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present . And Eleanor , with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character , taking an early occasion of saying to her , \u201c My father only wanted me to answer a note , \u201d she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the General , or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so . Upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence , after the company left them , and nothing occurred to disturb it . In the course of this morning \u2019s reflections , she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone . It would be much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter . To involve her in the danger of a second detection , to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart , could not be the office of a friend . The General \u2019s utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter ; and , besides , she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion . It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions , from which the other had , in all likelihood , been hitherto happily exempt ; nor could she therefore , in _ her _ presence , search for those proofs of the General \u2019s cruelty , which however they might yet have escaped discovery , she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth , in the shape of some fragmented journal , continued to the last gasp . Of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress ; and as she wished to get it over before Henry \u2019s return , who was expected on the morrow , there was no time to be lost . The day was bright , her courage high ; at four o\u2019clock , the sun was now two hours above the horizon , and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual . It was done ; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike . It was no time for thought ; she hurried on , slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors , and without stopping to look or breathe , rushed forward to the one in question . The lock yielded to her hand , and , luckily , with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being . On tiptoe she entered ; the room was before her ; but it was some minutes before she could advance another step . She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature . She saw a large , well - proportioned apartment , an handsome dimity bed , arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid \u2019s care , a bright Bath stove , mahogany wardrobes , and neatly painted chairs , on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows ! Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked , and worked they were . Astonishment and doubt first seized them ; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame . She could not be mistaken as to the room ; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!\u2014in Miss Tilney \u2019s meaning , in her own calculation ! this apartment , to which she had given a date so ancient , a position so awful , proved to be one end of what the General \u2019s father had built . There were two other doors in the chamber , leading probably into dressing - closets ; but she had no inclination to open either . Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked , or the volume in which she had last read , remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper ? No : whatever might have been the General \u2019s crimes , he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection . She was sick of exploring , and desired but to be safe in her own room , with her own heart only privy to its folly ; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered , when the sound of footsteps , she could hardly tell where , made her pause and tremble . To be found there , even by a servant , would be unpleasant ; but by the General ( and he seemed always at hand when least wanted ) , much worse ! she listened \u2014 the sound had ceased ; and resolving not to lose a moment , she passed through and closed the door . At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened ; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs , by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery . She had no power to move . With a feeling of terror not very definable , she fixed her eyes on the staircase , and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view . \u201c Mr. Tilney ! \u201d she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment . He looked astonished too . \u201c Good God ! \u201d she continued , not attending to his address . \u201c How came you here ? How came you up that staircase ? \u201d \u201c How came I up that staircase ! \u201d he replied , greatly surprised . \u201c Because it is my nearest way from the stable - yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? \u201d Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford . She moved on towards the gallery . \u201c And may I not , in my turn , \u201d said he , as he pushed back the folding doors , \u201c ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . \u201d \u201c I have been , \u201d said Catherine , looking down , \u201c to see your mother \u2019s room . \u201d \u201c My mother \u2019s room ! is there anything extraordinary to be seen there ? \u201d \u201c No , nothing at all . I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . \u201d \u201c I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me . You look pale . I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs . Perhaps you did not know \u2014 you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use ? \u201d \u201c No , I was not . You have had a very fine day for your ride . \u201d \u201c Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? \u201d \u201c Oh no ! she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday \u2014 and we were coming here to these rooms \u2014 but only , \u201d dropping her voice , \u201c your father was with us . \u201d \u201c And that prevented you , \u201d said Henry , earnestly regarding her . \u201c Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage ? \u201d \u201c No , I only wanted to see \u2014 Is not it very late ? I must go and dress . \u201d \u201c It is only a quarter past four , \u201d showing his watch ; \u201c and you are not now in Bath . No theatre , no rooms to prepare for . Half an hour at Northanger must be enough . \u201d She could not contradict it , and therefore suffered herself to be detained , though her dread of further questions made her , for the first time in their acquaintance , wish to leave him . They walked slowly up the gallery . \u201c Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you ? \u201d \u201c No , and I am very much surprised . Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly . \u201d \u201c Promised so faithfully ! a faithful promise ! that puzzles me . I have heard of a faithful performance . But a faithful promise \u2014 the fidelity of promising ! it is a power little worth knowing , however , since it can deceive and pain you . My mother \u2019s room is very commodious , is it not ? Large and cheerful - looking , and the dressing - closets so well disposed ! It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house , and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own . She sent you to look at it , I suppose ? \u201d \u201c No . \u201d \u201c It has been your own doing entirely ? \u201d Catherine said nothing . After a short silence , during which he had closely observed her , he added , \u201c As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity , this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother \u2019s character , as described by Eleanor , which does honour to her memory . The world , I believe , never saw a better woman . But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this . The domestic , unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent , venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours . Eleanor , I suppose , has talked of her a great deal ? \u201d \u201c Yes , a great deal . That is \u2014 no , not much , but what she did say was very interesting . Her dying so suddenly \u201d ( slowly , and with hesitation it was spoken ) , \u201c and you \u2014 none of you being at home \u2014 and your father , I thought \u2014 perhaps had not been very fond of her . \u201d \u201c And from these circumstances , \u201d he replied ( his quick eye fixed on hers ) , \u201c you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence \u2014 some\u201d\u2014(involuntarily she shook her head)\u2014\u201cor it may be \u2014 of something still less pardonable . \u201d She raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before . \u201c My mother \u2019s illness , \u201d he continued , \u201c the seizure which ended in her death , _ was _ sudden . The malady itself , one from which she had often suffered , a bilious fever \u2014 its cause therefore constitutional . On the third day , in short , as soon as she could be prevailed on , a physician attended her , a very respectable man , and one in whom she had always placed great confidence . Upon his opinion of her danger , two others were called in the next day , and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours . On the fifth day she died . During the progress of her disorder , Frederick and I ( _ we _ were both at home ) saw her repeatedly ; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her , or which her situation in life could command . Poor Eleanor was absent , and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin . \u201d \u201c But your father , \u201d said Catherine , \u201c was _ he _ afflicted ? \u201d \u201c For a time , greatly so . You have erred in supposing him not attached to her . He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to \u2014 we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition \u2014 and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did . His value of her was sincere ; and , if not permanently , he was truly afflicted by her death . \u201d \u201c I am very glad of it , \u201d said Catherine ; \u201c it would have been very shocking ! \u201d \u201c If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to \u2014 Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained . What have you been judging from ? Remember the country and the age in which we live . Remember that we are English , that we are Christians . Consult your own understanding , your own sense of the probable , your own observation of what is passing around you . Does our education prepare us for such atrocities ? Do our laws connive at them ? Could they be perpetrated without being known , in a country like this , where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing , where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies , and where roads and newspapers lay everything open ? Dearest Miss Morland , what ideas have you been admitting ? \u201d They had reached the end of the gallery , and with tears of shame she ran off to her own room .", "clusters": [{"mentions":
