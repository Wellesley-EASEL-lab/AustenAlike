{"document": "25 The visions of romance were over . Catherine was completely awakened . Henry \u2019s address , short as it had been , had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done . Most grievously was she humbled . Most bitterly did she cry . It was not only with herself that she was sunk \u2014 but with Henry . Her folly , which now seemed even criminal , was all exposed to him , and he must despise her forever . The liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father \u2014 could he ever forgive it ? The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears \u2014 could they ever be forgotten ? She hated herself more than she could express . He had \u2014 she thought he had , once or twice before this fatal morning , shown something like affection for her . But now \u2014 in short , she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour , went down when the clock struck five , with a broken heart , and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor \u2019s inquiry if she was well . The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room , and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual . Catherine had never wanted comfort more , and he looked as if he was aware of it . The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness ; and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity . She did not learn either to forget or defend the past ; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther , and that it might not cost her Henry \u2019s entire regard . Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done , nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary , self - created delusion , each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm , and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which , before she entered the abbey , had been craving to be frightened . She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of Northanger . She saw that the infatuation had been created , the mischief settled , long before her quitting Bath , and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged . Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe \u2019s works , and charming even as were the works of all her imitators , it was not in them perhaps that human nature , at least in the Midland counties of England , was to be looked for . Of the Alps and Pyrenees , with their pine forests and their vices , they might give a faithful delineation ; and Italy , Switzerland , and the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there represented . Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country , and even of that , if hard pressed , would have yielded the northern and western extremities . But in the central part of England there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved , in the laws of the land , and the manners of the age . Murder was not tolerated , servants were not slaves , and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured , like rhubarb , from every druggist . Among the Alps and Pyrenees , perhaps , there were no mixed characters . There , such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend . But in England it was not so ; among the English , she believed , in their hearts and habits , there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad . Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable . Her mind made up on these several points , and her resolution formed , of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense , she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever ; and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day . Henry \u2019s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct , in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed , was of the greatest assistance to her ; and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress , her spirits became absolutely comfortable , and capable , as heretofore , of continual improvement by anything he said . There were still some subjects , indeed , under which she believed they must always tremble \u2014 the mention of a chest or a cabinet , for instance \u2014 and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape : but even _ she _ could allow that an occasional memento of past folly , however painful , might not be without use . The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance . Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater . She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella \u2019s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James . Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella . James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton . But Isabella had promised and promised again ; and when she promised a thing , she was so scrupulous in performing it ! this made it so particularly strange ! For nine successive mornings , Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment , which each morning became more severe : but , on the tenth , when she entered the breakfast - room , her first object was a letter , held out by Henry \u2019s willing hand . She thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself . \u201c \u2019 Tis only from James , however , \u201d as she looked at the direction . She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : \u201c Dear Catherine , \u201c Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me . I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again . I shall not enter into particulars \u2014 they would only pain you more . You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God ! i am undeceived in time ! but it is a heavy blow ! after my father \u2019s consent had been so kindly given \u2014 but no more of this . She has made me miserable forever ! let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; _ your _ love I do build upon . I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced . Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much . I have written to him and my father . Her duplicity hurts me more than all ; till the very last , if I reasoned with her , she declared herself as much attached to me as ever , and laughed at my fears . I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it ; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved , I was that man . I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney . We parted at last by mutual consent \u2014 happy for me had we never met ! i can never expect to know such another woman ! Dearest Catherine , beware how you give your heart . \u201c Believe me , \u201d & c. Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began . He was prevented , however , from even looking his surprise by his father \u2019s entrance . They went to breakfast directly ; but Catherine could hardly eat anything . Tears filled her eyes , and even ran down her cheeks as she sat . The letter was one moment in her hand , then in her lap , and then in her pocket ; and she looked as if she knew not what she did . The General , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible . As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room ; but the housemaids were busy in it , and she was obliged to come down again . She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her . She drew back , trying to beg their pardon , but was , with gentle violence , forced to return ; and the others withdrew , after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her . After half an hour \u2019s free indulgence of grief and reflection , Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends ; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration . Perhaps , if particularly questioned , she might just give an idea \u2014 just distantly hint at it \u2014 but not more . To expose a friend , such a friend as Isabella had been to her \u2014 and then their own brother so closely concerned in it ! She believed she must waive the subject altogether . Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast - room ; and each , as she entered it , looked at her anxiously . Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , \u201c No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? Mr. and Mrs. Morland \u2014 your brothers and sisters \u2014 I hope they are none of them ill ? \u201d \u201c No , I thank you \u201d ( sighing as she spoke ) ; \u201c they are all very well . My letter was from my brother at Oxford . \u201d Nothing further was said for a few minutes ; and then speaking through her tears , she added , \u201c I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again ! \u201d \u201c I am sorry , \u201d said Henry , closing the book he had just opened ; \u201c if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . \u201d \u201c It contained something worse than anybody could suppose ! poor James is so unhappy ! you will soon know why . \u201d \u201c To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , \u201d replied Henry warmly , \u201c must be a comfort to him under any distress . \u201d \u201c I have one favour to beg , \u201d said Catherine , shortly afterwards , in an agitated manner , \u201c that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . \u201d \u201c Our brother ! frederick ! \u201d \u201c Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . \u201d Eleanor \u2019s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment ; but Henry began to suspect the truth , and something , in which Miss Thorpe \u2019s name was included , passed his lips . \u201c How quick you are ! \u201d cried Catherine : \u201c you have guessed it , I declare ! And yet , when we talked about it in Bath , you little thought of its ending so . Isabella \u2014 no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her \u2014 Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours ! could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? \u201d \u201c I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed . I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland \u2019s disappointment . His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable . I think you must be deceived so far . I am very sorry for Mr. Morland \u2014 sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy ; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick \u2019s marrying her than at any other part of the story . \u201d \u201c It is very true , however ; you shall read James \u2019s letter yourself . Stay \u2014 There is one part \u2014 \u201d recollecting with a blush the last line . \u201c Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? \u201d \u201c No , read it yourself , \u201d cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer . \u201c I do not know what I was thinking of \u201d ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; \u201c James only means to give me good advice . \u201d He gladly received the letter , and , having read it through , with close attention , returned it saying , \u201c Well , if it is to be so , I can only say that I am sorry for it . Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected . I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . \u201d Miss Tilney , at Catherine \u2019s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe \u2019s connections and fortune . \u201c Her mother is a very good sort of woman , \u201d was Catherine \u2019s answer . \u201c What was her father ? \u201d \u201c A lawyer , I believe . They live at Putney . \u201d \u201c Are they a wealthy family ? \u201d \u201c No , not very . I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family . Your father is so very liberal ! He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children . \u201d The brother and sister looked at each other . \u201c But , \u201d said Eleanor , after a short pause , \u201c would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ? She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so . And how strange an infatuation on Frederick \u2019s side ! a girl who , before his eyes , is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man ! is not it inconceivable , Henry ? Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly ! who found no woman good enough to be loved ! \u201d \u201c That is the most unpromising circumstance , the strongest presumption against him . When I think of his past declarations , I give him up . Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe \u2019s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured . It is all over with Frederick indeed ! he is a deceased man \u2014 defunct in understanding . Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . \u201d \u201c Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , \u201d said Eleanor with a smile . \u201c But perhaps , \u201d observed Catherine , \u201c though she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours . Now she has really got the man she likes , she may be constant . \u201d \u201c Indeed I am afraid she will , \u201d replied Henry ; \u201c I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick \u2019s only chance . I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . \u201d \u201c You think it is all for ambition , then ? And , upon my word , there are some things that seem very like it . I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more . I never was so deceived in anyone \u2019s character in my life before . \u201d \u201c Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . \u201d \u201c My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it . \u201d \u201c Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours . You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy . Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent . You would not , for instance , now go to a ball for the world . You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve , on whose regard you can place dependence , or whose counsel , in any difficulty , you could rely on . You feel all this ? \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said Catherine , after a few moments \u2019 reflection , \u201c I do not \u2014 ought I ? To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought . \u201d \u201c You feel , as you always do , what is most to the credit of human nature . Such feelings ought to be investigated , that they may know themselves . \u201d Catherine , by some chance or other , found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on , though so unaccountably , to mention the circumstance which had produced it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 9], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [27, 28],
