{"document": "5 Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening , in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe , though they certainly claimed much of her leisure , as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach ; but she looked in vain . Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump - room . She hoped to be more fortunate the next day ; and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning , she hardly felt a doubt of it ; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants , and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is . As soon as divine service was over , the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other ; and after staying long enough in the pump - room to discover that the crowd was insupportable , and that there was not a genteel face to be seen , which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season , they hastened away to the Crescent , to breathe the fresh air of better company . Here Catherine and Isabella , arm in arm , again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation ; they talked much , and with much enjoyment ; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner . He was nowhere to be met with ; every search for him was equally unsuccessful , in morning lounges or evening assemblies ; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms , at dressed or undressed balls , was he perceivable ; nor among the walkers , the horsemen , or the curricle - drivers of the morning . His name was not in the pump - room book , and curiosity could do no more . He must be gone from Bath . Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short ! this sort of mysteriousness , which is always so becoming in a hero , threw a fresh grace in Catherine \u2019s imagination around his person and manners , and increased her anxiety to know more of him . From the Thorpes she could learn nothing , for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen . It was a subject , however , in which she often indulged with her fair friend , from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him ; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken . Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man , and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine , and would therefore shortly return . She liked him the better for being a clergyman , \u201c for she must confess herself very partial to the profession \u201d ; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it . Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion \u2014 but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love , or the duties of friendship , to know when delicate raillery was properly called for , or when a confidence should be forced . Mrs. Allen was now quite happy \u2014 quite satisfied with Bath . She had found some acquaintance , had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend ; and , as the completion of good fortune , had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself . Her daily expressions were no longer , \u201c I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath ! \u201d They were changed into , \u201c How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! \u201d and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families , as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be ; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe , in what they called conversation , but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion , and not often any resemblance of subject , for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children , and Mrs. Allen of her gowns . The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm , and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves . They called each other by their Christian name , were always arm in arm when they walked , pinned up each other \u2019s train for the dance , and were not to be divided in the set ; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments , they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt , and shut themselves up , to read novels together . Yes , novels ; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel - writers , of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances , to the number of which they are themselves adding \u2014 joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works , and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine , who , if she accidentally take up a novel , is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust . Alas ! if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another , from whom can she expect protection and regard ? I can not approve of it . Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure , and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans . Let us not desert one another ; we are an injured body . Although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world , no species of composition has been so much decried . From pride , ignorance , or fashion , our foes are almost as many as our readers . And while the abilities of the nine - hundredth abridger of the History of England , or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton , Pope , and Prior , with a paper from the Spectator , and a chapter from Sterne , are eulogized by a thousand pens \u2014 there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist , and of slighting the performances which have only genius , wit , and taste to recommend them . \u201c I am no novel - reader \u2014 I seldom look into novels \u2014 Do not imagine that _ I _ often read novels \u2014 It is really very well for a novel . \u201d Such is the common ca nt . \u201c And what are you reading , Miss \u2014 \u2014 ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! it is only a novel ! \u201d replies the young lady , while she lays down her book with affected indifference , or momentary shame . \u201c It is only Cecilia , or Camilla , or Belinda \u201d ; or , in short , only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed , in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature , the happiest delineation of its varieties , the liveliest effusions of wit and humour , are conveyed to the world in the best - chosen language . Now , had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the Spectator , instead of such a work , how proudly would she have produced the book , and told its name ; though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication , of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste : the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances , unnatural characters , and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living ; and their language , too , frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [29, 30], "text": "her"}, {"position": [48, 49], "text": "her"}, {"position": [54, 55], "text": "she"}, {"position": [73, 74], "text": "She"}, {"position": [85, 86], "text": "her"}, {"position": [98, 99], "text": "she"}, {"position": [215, 216], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [246, 247], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [249, 250], "text": "her"}, {"position": [253, 254], "text": "her"}, {"position": [371, 372], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [382, 383], "text": "her"}, {"position": [393, 394], "text": "she"}, {"position": [423, 424], "text": "she"}, {"position": [427, 428], "text": "her"}, {"position": [433, 434], "text": "she"}, {"position": [449, 450], "text": "her"}, {"position": [482, 485], "text": "her dear Catherine"}, {"position": [504, 505], "text": "she"}, {"position": [507, 508], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [528, 529], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [542, 543], "text": "she"}, {"position": [763, 764], "text": "Catherine"}], "name": "Catherine"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [42, 44], "text": "Mr. Tilney"}, {"position": [59, 61], "text": "Mr. Tilney"}], "name": "Mr. Tilney"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [202, 204], "text": "the Crescent"}, {"position": [214, 215], "text": "Here"}], "name": "the Crescent"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [253, 255], "text": "her partner"}, {"position": [256, 257], "text": "He"}, {"position": [267, 268], "text": "him"}, {"position": [294, 295], "text": "he"}, {"position": [314, 315], "text": "His"}, {"position": [332, 333], "text": "He"}, {"position": [340, 341], "text": "he"}, {"position": [345, 346], "text": "his"}, {"position": [375, 376], "text": "his"}, {"position": [388, 389], "text": "him"}, {"position": [443, 444], "text": "him"}, {"position": [446, 447], "text": "his"}, {"position": [463, 464], "text": "he"}, {"position": [476, 477], "text": "he"}, {"position": [494, 495], "text": "him"}], "name": "her partner"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [111, 112], "text": "Bath"}, {"position": [337, 338], "text": "Bath"}, {"position": [406, 407], "text": "Bath"}, {"position": [587, 588], "text": "Bath"}, {"position": [651, 652], "text": "Bath"}], "name": "Bath"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [150, 152], "text": "the Thorpes"}, {"position": [391, 393], "text": "the Thorpes"}], "name": "the Thorpes"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [217, 218], "text": "Isabella"}, {"position": [458, 459], "text": "Isabella"}, {"position": [482, 483], "text": "her"}, {"position": [492, 493], "text": "She"}, {"position": [521, 522], "text": "her"}, {"position": [523, 524], "text": "she"}, {"position": [691, 692], "text": "Isabella"}, {"position": [765, 766], "text": "Isabella"}], "name": "Isabella"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [411, 413], "text": "Mrs. Allen"}, {"position": [577, 579], "text": "Mrs. Allen"}, {"position": [589, 590], "text": "She"}, {"position": [634, 635], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [636, 637], "text": "Her"}, {"position": [644, 645], "text": "I"}, {"position": [662, 663], "text": "I"}, {"position": [673, 674], "text": "she"}, {"position": [687, 688], "text": "her"}, {"position": [702, 703], "text": "she"}, {"position": [751, 753], "text": "Mrs. Allen"}, {"position": [754, 755], "text": "her"}, {"position": [881, 882], "text": "I"}, {"position": [991, 992], "text": "I"}], "name": "Mrs. Allen"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [20, 22], "text": "Miss Thorpe"}, {"position": [668, 670], "text": "Mrs. Thorpe"}, {"position": [712, 714], "text": "Mrs. Thorpe"}, {"position": [742, 744], "text": "Mrs. Thorpe"}, {"position": [747, 748], "text": "her"}], "name": "Mrs. Thorpe"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [947, 948], "text": "she"}, {"position": [985, 986], "text": "she"}], "name": "she"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [1192, 1193], "text": "I"}, {"position": [1199, 1200], "text": "I"}, {"position": [1210, 1211], "text": "I"}, {"position": [1237, 1238], "text": "you"}, {"position": [1240, 1241], "text": "Miss"}, {"position": [1256, 1259], "text": "the young lady"}, {"position": [1261, 1262], "text": "she"}, {"position": [1264, 1265], "text": "her"}, {"position": [1346, 1350], "text": "the same young lady"}, {"position": [1368, 1369], "text": "she"}, {"position": [1385, 1386], "text": "her"}], "name": "the young lady"}]}
