{"document": "8 In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker , however , the party from Pulteney Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time . The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before them ; and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste , of admiring the set of her gown , and envying the curl of her hair , they followed their chaperons , arm in arm , into the ballroom , whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred , and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection . The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated ; and James , who had been engaged quite as long as his sister , was very importunate with Isabella to stand up ; but John was gone into the card - room to speak to a friend , and nothing , she declared , should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too . \u201c I assure you , \u201d said she , \u201c I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world ; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening . \u201d Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude , and they continued as they were for three minutes longer , when Isabella , who had been talking to James on the other side of her , turned again to his sister and whispered , \u201c My dear creature , I am afraid I must leave you , your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin ; I know you will not mind my going away , and I dare say John will be back in a moment , and then you may easily find me out . \u201d Catherine , though a little disappointed , had too much good nature to make any opposition , and the others rising up , Isabella had only time to press her friend \u2019s hand and say , \u201c Good - bye , my dear love , \u201d before they hurried off . The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing , Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen , between whom she now remained . She could not help being vexed at the non - appearance of Mr. Thorpe , for she not only longed to be dancing , but was likewise aware that , as the real dignity of her situation could not be known , she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner . To be disgraced in the eye of the world , to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity , her actions all innocence , and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement , is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine \u2019s life , and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character . Catherine had fortitude too ; she suffered , but no murmur passed her lips . From this state of humiliation , she was roused , at the end of ten minutes , to a pleasanter feeling , by seeing , not Mr. Thorpe , but Mr. Tilney , within three yards of the place where they sat ; he seemed to be moving that way , but he did not see her , and therefore the smile and the blush , which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine , passed away without sullying her heroic importance . He looked as handsome and as lively as ever , and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing - looking young woman , who leant on his arm , and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister ; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever , by being married already . But guided only by what was simple and probable , it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married ; he had not behaved , he had not talked , like the married men to whom she had been used ; he had never mentioned a wife , and he had acknowledged a sister . From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister \u2019s now being by his side ; and therefore , instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen \u2019s bosom , Catherine sat erect , in the perfect use of her senses , and with cheeks only a little redder than usual . Mr. Tilney and his companion , who continued , though slowly , to approach , were immediately preceded by a lady , an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe ; and this lady stopping to speak to her , they , as belonging to her , stopped likewise , and Catherine , catching Mr. Tilney \u2019s eye , instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition . She returned it with pleasure , and then advancing still nearer , he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen , by whom he was very civilly acknowledged . \u201c I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . \u201d He thanked her for her fears , and said that he had quitted it for a week , on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her . \u201c Well , sir , and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again , for it is just the place for young people \u2014 and indeed for everybody else too . I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health . \u201d \u201c And I hope , madam , that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place , from finding it of service to him . \u201d \u201c Thank you , sir . I have no doubt that he will . A neighbour of ours , Dr. Skinner , was here for his health last winter , and came away quite stout . \u201d \u201c That circumstance must give great encouragement . \u201d \u201c Yes , sir \u2014 and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months ; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away . \u201d Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen , that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats , as they had agreed to join their party . This was accordingly done , Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them ; and after a few minutes \u2019 consideration , he asked Catherine to dance with him . This compliment , delightful as it was , produced severe mortification to the lady ; and in giving her denial , she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it , that had Thorpe , who joined her just afterwards , been half a minute earlier , he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute . The very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot ; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up , of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left , and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them , interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney . Of her dear Isabella , to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman , she could see nothing . They were in different sets . She was separated from all her party , and away from all her acquaintance ; one mortification succeeded another , and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson , that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady . From such a moralizing strain as this , she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder , and turning round , perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her , attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman . \u201c I beg your pardon , Miss Morland , \u201d said she , \u201c for this liberty \u2014 but I can not anyhow get to Miss Thorpe , and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you . \u201d Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine . The young ladies were introduced to each other , Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness , Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation ; and Mrs. Hughes , satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge , returned to her party . Miss Tilney had a good figure , a pretty face , and a very agreeable countenance ; and her air , though it had not all the decided pretension , the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe \u2019s , had more real elegance . Her manners showed good sense and good breeding ; they were neither shy nor affectedly open ; and she seemed capable of being young , attractive , and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her , and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence . Catherine , interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney , was desirous of being acquainted with her , and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say , and had courage and leisure for saying it . But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy , by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites , prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance , by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath , how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country , whether she drew , or played , or sang , and whether she was fond of riding on horseback . The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella , who in great spirits exclaimed , \u201c At last I have got you . My dearest creature , I have been looking for you this hour . What could induce you to come into this set , when you knew I was in the other ? I have been quite wretched without you . \u201d \u201c My dear Isabella , how was it possible for me to get at you ? I could not even see where you were . \u201d \u201c So I told your brother all the time \u2014 but he would not believe me . Do go and see for her , Mr. Morland , said I \u2014 but all in vain \u2014 he would not stir an inch . Was not it so , Mr. Morland ? But you men are all so immoderately lazy ! i have been scolding him to such a degree , my dear Catherine , you would be quite amazed . You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people . \u201d \u201c Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head , \u201d whispered Catherine , detaching her friend from James . \u201c It is Mr. Tilney \u2019s sister . \u201d \u201c Oh ! heavens ! you do n\u2019t say so ! let me look at her this moment . What a delightful girl ! i never saw anything half so beautiful ! but where is her all - conquering brother ? Is he in the room ? Point him out to me this instant , if he is . I die to see him . Mr. Morland , you are not to listen . We are not talking about you . \u201d \u201c But what is all this whispering about ? What is going on ? \u201d \u201c There now , I knew how it would be . You men have such restless curiosity ! talk of the curiosity of women , indeed ! \u2019 Tis nothing . But be satisfied , for you are not to know anything at all of the matter . \u201d \u201c And is that likely to satisfy me , do you think ? \u201d \u201c Well , I declare I never knew anything like you . What can it signify to you , what we are talking of . Perhaps we are talking about you ; therefore I would advise you not to listen , or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable . \u201d In this commonplace chatter , which lasted some time , the original subject seemed entirely forgotten ; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while , she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella \u2019s impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney . When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance , James would have led his fair partner away , but she resisted . \u201c I tell you , Mr. Morland , \u201d she cried , \u201c I would not do such a thing for all the world . How can you be so teasing ; only conceive , my dear Catherine , what your brother wants me to do . He wants me to dance with him again , though I tell him that it is a most improper thing , and entirely against the rules . It would make us the talk of the place , if we were not to change partners . \u201d \u201c Upon my honour , \u201d said James , \u201c in these public assemblies , it is as often done as not . \u201d \u201c Nonsense , how can you say so ? But when you men have a point to carry , you never stick at anything . My sweet Catherine , do support me ; persuade your brother how impossible it is . Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing ; now would not it ? \u201d \u201c No , not at all ; but if you think it wrong , you had much better change . \u201d \u201c There , \u201d cried Isabella , \u201c you hear what your sister says , and yet you will not mind her . Well , remember that it is not my fault , if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle . Come along , my dearest Catherine , for heaven \u2019s sake , and stand by me . \u201d And off they went , to regain their former place . John Thorpe , in the meanwhile , had walked away ; and Catherine , ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once , made her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could , in the hope of finding him still with them \u2014 a hope which , when it proved to be fruitless , she felt to have been highly unreasonable . \u201c Well , my dear , \u201d said Mrs. Thorpe , impatient for praise of her son , \u201c I hope you have had an agreeable partner . \u201d \u201c Very agreeable , madam . \u201d \u201c I am glad of it . John has charming spirits , has not he ? \u201d \u201c Did you meet Mr. Tilney , my dear ? \u201d said Mrs. Allen . \u201c No , where is he ? \u201d \u201c He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . \u201d \u201c Where can he be ? \u201d said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance . \u201c Ah ! he has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , \u201d said Mrs. Allen ; and after a short silence , she added , \u201c he is a very agreeable young man . \u201d \u201c Indeed he is , Mrs. Allen , \u201d said Mrs. Thorpe , smiling complacently ; \u201c I must say it , though I _ am _ his mother , that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world . \u201d This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many ; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen , for after only a moment \u2019s consideration , she said , in a whisper to Catherine , \u201c I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son . \u201d Catherine was disappointed and vexed . She seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view ; and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply , when John Thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said , \u201c Well , Miss Morland , I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again . \u201d \u201c Oh , no ; I am much obliged to you , our two dances are over ; and , besides , I am tired , and do not mean to dance any more . \u201d \u201c Do not you ? Then let us walk about and quiz people . Come along with me , and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room ; my two younger sisters and their partners . I have been laughing at them this half hour . \u201d Again Catherine excused herself ; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself . The rest of the evening she found very dull ; Mr. Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea , to attend that of his partner ; Miss Tilney , though belonging to it , did not sit near her , and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile , one squeeze , and one \u201c dearest Catherine . \u201d",
