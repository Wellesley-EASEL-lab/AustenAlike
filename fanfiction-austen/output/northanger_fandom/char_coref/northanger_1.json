{"document": "1 No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine . Her situation in life , the character of her father and mother , her own person and disposition , were all equally against her . Her father was a clergyman , without being neglected , or poor , and a very respectable man , though his name was Richard \u2014 and he had never been handsome . He had a considerable independence besides two good livings \u2014 and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters . Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense , with a good temper , and , what is more remarkable , with a good constitution . She had three sons before Catherine was born ; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world , as anybody might expect , she still lived on \u2014 lived to have six children more \u2014 to see them growing up around her , and to enjoy excellent health herself . A family of ten children will be always called a fine family , where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number ; but the Morlands had little other right to the word , for they were in general very plain , and Catherine , for many years of her life , as plain as any . She had a thin awkward figure , a sallow skin without colour , dark lank hair , and strong features \u2014 so much for her person ; and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind . She was fond of all boys \u2019 plays , and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls , but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy , nursing a dormouse , feeding a canary - bird , or watering a rose - bush . Indeed she had no taste for a garden ; and if she gathered flowers at all , it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief \u2014 at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take . Such were her propensities \u2014 her abilities were quite as extraordinary . She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught ; and sometimes not even then , for she was often inattentive , and occasionally stupid . Her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the \u201c Beggar \u2019s Petition \u201d ; and after all , her next sister , Sally , could say it better than she did . Not that Catherine was always stupid \u2014 by no means ; she learnt the fable of \u201c The Hare and Many Friends \u201d as quickly as any girl in England . Her mother wished her to learn music ; and Catherine was sure she should like it , for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet ; so , at eight years old she began . She learnt a year , and could not bear it ; and Mrs. Morland , who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste , allowed her to leave off . The day which dismissed the music - master was one of the happiest of Catherine \u2019s life . Her taste for drawing was not superior ; though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper , she did what she could in that way , by drawing houses and trees , hens and chickens , all very much like one another . Writing and accounts she was taught by her father ; French by her mother : her proficiency in either was not remarkable , and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could . What a strange , unaccountable character!\u2014for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old , she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper , was seldom stubborn , scarcely ever quarrelsome , and very kind to the little ones , with few interruptions of tyranny ; she was moreover noisy and wild , hated confinement and cleanliness , and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house . Such was Catherine Morland at ten . At fifteen , appearances were mending ; she began to curl her hair and long for balls ; her complexion improved , her features were softened by plumpness and colour , her eyes gained more animation , and her figure more consequence . Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery , and she grew clean as she grew smart ; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement . \u201c Catherine grows quite a good - looking girl \u2014 she is almost pretty to - day , \u201d were words which caught her ears now and then ; and how welcome were the sounds ! to look _ almost _ pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive . Mrs. Morland was a very good woman , and wished to see her children everything they ought to be ; but her time was so much occupied in lying - in and teaching the little ones , that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves ; and it was not very wonderful that Catherine , who had by nature nothing heroic about her , should prefer cricket , baseball , riding on horseback , and running about the country at the age of fourteen , to books \u2014 or at least books of information \u2014 for , provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them , provided they were all story and no reflection , she had never any objection to books at all . But from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine ; she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives . From Pope , she learnt to censure those who \u201c bear about the mockery of woe . \u201d From Gray , that \u201c Many a flower is born to blush unseen , \u201c And waste its fragrance on the desert air . \u201d From Thomson , that \u2014 \u201c It is a delightful task \u201c To teach the young idea how to shoot . \u201d And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information \u2014 amongst the rest , that \u2014 \u201c Trifles light as air , \u201c Are , to the jealous , confirmation strong , \u201c As proofs of Holy Writ . \u201d That \u201c The poor beetle , which we tread upon , \u201c In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great \u201c As when a giant dies . \u201d And that a young woman in love always looks \u2014 \u201c like Patience on a monument \u201c Smiling at Grief . \u201d So far her improvement was sufficient \u2014 and in many other points she came on exceedingly well ; for though she could not write sonnets , she brought herself to read them ; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte , of her own composition , she could listen to other people \u2019s performance with very little fatigue . Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil \u2014 she had no notion of drawing \u2014 not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover \u2019s profile , that she might be detected in the design . There she fell miserably short of the true heroic height . At present she did not know her own poverty , for she had no lover to portray . She had reached the age of seventeen , without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility , without having inspired one real passion , and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient . This was strange indeed ! but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out . There was not one lord in the neighbourhood ; no \u2014 not even a baronet . There was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door \u2014 not one young man whose origin was unknown . Her father had no ward , and the squire of the parish no children . But when a young lady is to be a heroine , the perverseness of forty surrounding families can not prevent her . Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way . Mr. Allen , who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton , the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived , was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution \u2014 and his lady , a good - humoured woman , fond of Miss Morland , and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village , she must seek them abroad , invited her to go with them . Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance , and Catherine all happiness .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [7, 9], "text": "Catherine Morland"}, {"position": [10, 11], "text": "her"},
