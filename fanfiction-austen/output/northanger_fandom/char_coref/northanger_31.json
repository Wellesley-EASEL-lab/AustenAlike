{"document": "31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland \u2019s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine \u2019s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start . His pleasing manners and good sense were self - evident recommendations ; and having never heard evil of him , it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told . Goodwill supplying the place of experience , his character needed no attestation . \u201c Catherine would make a sad , heedless young housekeeper to be sure , \u201d was her mother \u2019s foreboding remark ; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice . There was but one obstacle , in short , to be mentioned ; but till that one was removed , it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement . Their tempers were mild , but their principles were steady , and while his parent so expressly forbade the connection , they could not allow themselves to encourage it . That the General should come forward to solicit the alliance , or that he should even very heartily approve it , they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation ; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded , and that once obtained \u2014 and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied \u2014 their willing approbation was instantly to follow . His _ consent _ was all that they wished for . They were no more inclined than entitled to demand his _ money _ . Of a very considerable fortune , his son was , by marriage settlements , eventually secure ; his present income was an income of independence and comfort , and under every pecuniary view , it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter . The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this . They felt and they deplored \u2014 but they could not resent it ; and they parted , endeavouring to hope that such a change in the General , as each believed almost impossible , might speedily take place , to unite them again in the fulness of privileged affection . Henry returned to what was now his only home , to watch over his young plantations , and extend his improvements for her sake , to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward ; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry . Whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence , let us not inquire . Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did \u2014 they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way . The anxiety , which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine , and of all who loved either , as to its final event , can hardly extend , I fear , to the bosom of my readers , who will see in the tell - tale compression of the pages before them , that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity . The means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt : what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the General \u2019s ? The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer \u2014 an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him \u201c to be a fool if he liked it ! \u201d The marriage of Eleanor Tilney , her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry \u2019s banishment , to the home of her choice and the man of her choice , is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance . My own joy on the occasion is very sincere . I know no one more entitled , by unpretending merit , or better prepared by habitual suffering , to receive and enjoy felicity . Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin ; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her . His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her \u201c Your Ladyship ! \u201d Her husband was really deserving of her ; independent of his peerage , his wealth , and his attachment , being to a precision the most charming young man in the world . Any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary ; the most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination of us all . Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add \u2014 aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable \u2014 that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother \u2019s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland \u2019s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give . It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe \u2019s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it ; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor , and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds . This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride ; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence , which he was at some pains to procure , that the Fullerton estate , being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor , was consequently open to every greedy speculation . On the strength of this , the General , soon after Eleanor \u2019s marriage , permitted his son to return to Northanger , and thence made him the bearer of his consent , very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland . The event which it authorized soon followed : Henry and Catherine were married , the bells rang , and everybody smiled ; and , as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting , it will not appear , after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the General \u2019s cruelty , that they were essentially hurt by it . To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty - six and eighteen is to do pretty well ; and professing myself moreover convinced that the General \u2019s unjust interference , so far from being really injurious to their felicity , was perhaps rather conducive to it , by improving their knowledge of each other , and adding strength to their attachment , I leave it to be settled , by whomsoever it may concern , whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny , or reward filial disobedience .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 5], "text":
