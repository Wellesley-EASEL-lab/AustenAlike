{"document": "8 In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker , however , the party from Pulteney Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time . The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before them ; and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste , of admiring the set of her gown , and envying the curl of her hair , they followed their chaperons , arm in arm , into the ballroom , whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred , and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection . The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated ; and James , who had been engaged quite as long as his sister , was very importunate with Isabella to stand up ; but John was gone into the card - room to speak to a friend , and nothing , she declared , should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too . \u201c I assure you , \u201d said she , \u201c I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world ; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening . \u201d Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude , and they continued as they were for three minutes longer , when Isabella , who had been talking to James on the other side of her , turned again to his sister and whispered , \u201c My dear creature , I am afraid I must leave you , your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin ; I know you will not mind my going away , and I dare say John will be back in a moment , and then you may easily find me out . \u201d Catherine , though a little disappointed , had too much good nature to make any opposition , and the others rising up , Isabella had only time to press her friend \u2019s hand and say , \u201c Good - bye , my dear love , \u201d before they hurried off . The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing , Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen , between whom she now remained . She could not help being vexed at the non - appearance of Mr. Thorpe , for she not only longed to be dancing , but was likewise aware that , as the real dignity of her situation could not be known , she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner . To be disgraced in the eye of the world , to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity , her actions all innocence , and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement , is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine \u2019s life , and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character . Catherine had fortitude too ; she suffered , but no murmur passed her lips . From this state of humiliation , she was roused , at the end of ten minutes , to a pleasanter feeling , by seeing , not Mr. Thorpe , but Mr. Tilney , within three yards of the place where they sat ; he seemed to be moving that way , but he did not see her , and therefore the smile and the blush , which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine , passed away without sullying her heroic importance . He looked as handsome and as lively as ever , and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing - looking young woman , who leant on his arm , and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister ; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever , by being married already . But guided only by what was simple and probable , it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married ; he had not behaved , he had not talked , like the married men to whom she had been used ; he had never mentioned a wife , and he had acknowledged a sister . From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister \u2019s now being by his side ; and therefore , instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen \u2019s bosom , Catherine sat erect , in the perfect use of her senses , and with cheeks only a little redder than usual . Mr. Tilney and his companion , who continued , though slowly , to approach , were immediately preceded by a lady , an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe ; and this lady stopping to speak to her , they , as belonging to her , stopped likewise , and Catherine , catching Mr. Tilney \u2019s eye , instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition . She returned it with pleasure , and then advancing still nearer , he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen , by whom he was very civilly acknowledged . \u201c I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . \u201d He thanked her for her fears , and said that he had quitted it for a week , on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her . \u201c Well , sir , and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again , for it is just the place for young people \u2014 and indeed for everybody else too . I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health . \u201d \u201c And I hope , madam , that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place , from finding it of service to him . \u201d \u201c Thank you , sir . I have no doubt that he will . A neighbour of ours , Dr. Skinner , was here for his health last winter , and came away quite stout . \u201d \u201c That circumstance must give great encouragement . \u201d \u201c Yes , sir \u2014 and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months ; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away . \u201d Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen , that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats , as they had agreed to join their party . This was accordingly done , Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them ; and after a few minutes \u2019 consideration , he asked Catherine to dance with him . This compliment , delightful as it was , produced severe mortification to the lady ; and in giving her denial , she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it , that had Thorpe , who joined her just afterwards , been half a minute earlier , he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute . The very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot ; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up , of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left , and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them , interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney . Of her dear Isabella , to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman , she could see nothing . They were in different sets . She was separated from all her party , and away from all her acquaintance ; one mortification succeeded another , and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson , that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady . From such a moralizing strain as this , she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder , and turning round , perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her , attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman . \u201c I beg your pardon , Miss Morland , \u201d said she , \u201c for this liberty \u2014 but I can not anyhow get to Miss Thorpe , and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you . \u201d Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine . The young ladies were introduced to each other , Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness , Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation ; and Mrs. Hughes , satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge , returned to her party . Miss Tilney had a good figure , a pretty face , and a very agreeable countenance ; and her air , though it had not all the decided pretension , the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe \u2019s , had more real elegance . Her manners showed good sense and good breeding ; they were neither shy nor affectedly open ; and she seemed capable of being young , attractive , and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her , and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence . Catherine , interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney , was desirous of being acquainted with her , and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say , and had courage and leisure for saying it . But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy , by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites , prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance , by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath , how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country , whether she drew , or played , or sang , and whether she was fond of riding on horseback . The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella , who in great spirits exclaimed , \u201c At last I have got you . My dearest creature , I have been looking for you this hour . What could induce you to come into this set , when you knew I was in the other ? I have been quite wretched without you . \u201d \u201c My dear Isabella , how was it possible for me to get at you ? I could not even see where you were . \u201d \u201c So I told your brother all the time \u2014 but he would not believe me . Do go and see for her , Mr. Morland , said I \u2014 but all in vain \u2014 he would not stir an inch . Was not it so , Mr. Morland ? But you men are all so immoderately lazy ! i have been scolding him to such a degree , my dear Catherine , you would be quite amazed . You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people . \u201d \u201c Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head , \u201d whispered Catherine , detaching her friend from James . \u201c It is Mr. Tilney \u2019s sister . \u201d \u201c Oh ! heavens ! you do n\u2019t say so ! let me look at her this moment . What a delightful girl ! i never saw anything half so beautiful ! but where is her all - conquering brother ? Is he in the room ? Point him out to me this instant , if he is . I die to see him . Mr. Morland , you are not to listen . We are not talking about you . \u201d \u201c But what is all this whispering about ? What is going on ? \u201d \u201c There now , I knew how it would be . You men have such restless curiosity ! talk of the curiosity of women , indeed ! \u2019 Tis nothing . But be satisfied , for you are not to know anything at all of the matter . \u201d \u201c And is that likely to satisfy me , do you think ? \u201d \u201c Well , I declare I never knew anything like you . What can it signify to you , what we are talking of . Perhaps we are talking about you ; therefore I would advise you not to listen , or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable . \u201d In this commonplace chatter , which lasted some time , the original subject seemed entirely forgotten ; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while , she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella \u2019s impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney . When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance , James would have led his fair partner away , but she resisted . \u201c I tell you , Mr. Morland , \u201d she cried , \u201c I would not do such a thing for all the world . How can you be so teasing ; only conceive , my dear Catherine , what your brother wants me to do . He wants me to dance with him again , though I tell him that it is a most improper thing , and entirely against the rules . It would make us the talk of the place , if we were not to change partners . \u201d \u201c Upon my honour , \u201d said James , \u201c in these public assemblies , it is as often done as not . \u201d \u201c Nonsense , how can you say so ? But when you men have a point to carry , you never stick at anything . My sweet Catherine , do support me ; persuade your brother how impossible it is . Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing ; now would not it ? \u201d \u201c No , not at all ; but if you think it wrong , you had much better change . \u201d \u201c There , \u201d cried Isabella , \u201c you hear what your sister says , and yet you will not mind her . Well , remember that it is not my fault , if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle . Come along , my dearest Catherine , for heaven \u2019s sake , and stand by me . \u201d And off they went , to regain their former place . John Thorpe , in the meanwhile , had walked away ; and Catherine , ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once , made her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could , in the hope of finding him still with them \u2014 a hope which , when it proved to be fruitless , she felt to have been highly unreasonable . \u201c Well , my dear , \u201d said Mrs. Thorpe , impatient for praise of her son , \u201c I hope you have had an agreeable partner . \u201d \u201c Very agreeable , madam . \u201d \u201c I am glad of it . John has charming spirits , has not he ? \u201d \u201c Did you meet Mr. Tilney , my dear ? \u201d said Mrs. Allen . \u201c No , where is he ? \u201d \u201c He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . \u201d \u201c Where can he be ? \u201d said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance . \u201c Ah ! he has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , \u201d said Mrs. Allen ; and after a short silence , she added , \u201c he is a very agreeable young man . \u201d \u201c Indeed he is , Mrs. Allen , \u201d said Mrs. Thorpe , smiling complacently ; \u201c I must say it , though I _ am _ his mother , that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world . \u201d This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many ; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen , for after only a moment \u2019s consideration , she said , in a whisper to Catherine , \u201c I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son . \u201d Catherine was disappointed and vexed . She seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view ; and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply , when John Thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said , \u201c Well , Miss Morland , I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again . \u201d \u201c Oh , no ; I am much obliged to you , our two dances are over ; and , besides , I am tired , and do not mean to dance any more . \u201d \u201c Do not you ? Then let us walk about and quiz people . Come along with me , and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room ; my two younger sisters and their partners . I have been laughing at them this half hour . \u201d Again Catherine excused herself ; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself . The rest of the evening she found very dull ; Mr. Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea , to attend that of his partner ; Miss Tilney , though belonging to it , did not sit near her , and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile , one squeeze , and one \u201c dearest Catherine . \u201d 9 The progress of Catherine \u2019s unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows . It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her , while she remained in the rooms , which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home . This , on arriving in Pulteney Street , took the direction of extraordinary hunger , and when that was appeased , changed into an earnest longing to be in bed ; such was the extreme point of her distress ; for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours , and from which she awoke perfectly revived , in excellent spirits , with fresh hopes and fresh schemes . The first wish of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney , and almost her first resolution , to seek her for that purpose , in the pump - room at noon . In the pump - room , one so newly arrived in Bath must be met with , and that building she had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence , and the completion of female intimacy , so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited confidence , that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls . Her plan for the morning thus settled , she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast , resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one ; and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen , whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such , that as she never talked a great deal , so she could never be entirely silent ; and , therefore , while she sat at her work , if she lost her needle or broke her thread , if she heard a carriage in the street , or saw a speck upon her gown , she must observe it aloud , whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not . At about half past twelve , a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window , and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door , in the first only a servant , her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second , before John Thorpe came running upstairs , calling out , \u201c Well , Miss Morland , here I am . Have you been waiting long ? We could not come before ; the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into , and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street . How do you do , Mrs. Allen ? A famous ball last night , was not it ? Come , Miss Morland , be quick , for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off . They want to get their tumble over . \u201d \u201c What do you mean ? \u201d said Catherine . \u201c Where are you all going to ? \u201d \u201c Going to ? Why , you have not forgot our engagement ! did not we agree together to take a drive this morning ? What a head you have ! we are going up Claverton Down . \u201d \u201c Something was said about it , I remember , \u201d said Catherine , looking at Mrs. Allen for her opinion ; \u201c but really I did not expect you . \u201d \u201c Not expect me ! that \u2019s a good one ! and what a dust you would have made , if I had not come . \u201d Catherine \u2019s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer . \u201c Well , ma\u2019am , what do you say to it ? Can you spare me for an hour or two ? Shall I go ? \u201d \u201c Do just as you please , my dear , \u201d replied Mrs. Allen , with the most placid indifference . Catherine took the advice , and ran off to get ready . In a very few minutes she reappeared , having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise , after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen \u2019s admiration of his gig ; and then receiving her friend \u2019s parting good wishes , they both hurried downstairs . \u201c My dearest creature , \u201d cried Isabella , to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage , \u201c you have been at least three hours getting ready . I was afraid you were ill . What a delightful ball we had last night . I have a thousand things to say to you ; but make haste and get in , for I long to be off . \u201d Catherine followed her orders and turned away , but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to James , \u201c What a sweet girl she is ! i quite dote on her . \u201d \u201c You will not be frightened , Miss Morland , \u201d said Thorpe , as he handed her in , \u201c if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off . He will , most likely , give a plunge or two , and perhaps take the rest for a minute ; but he will soon know his master . He is full of spirits , playful as can be , but there is no vice in him . \u201d Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one , but it was too late to retreat , and she was too young to own herself frightened ; so , resigning herself to her fate , and trusting to the animal \u2019s boasted knowledge of its owner , she sat peaceably down , and saw Thorpe sit down by her . Everything being then arranged , the servant who stood at the horse \u2019s head was bid in an important voice \u201c to let him go , \u201d and off they went in the quietest manner imaginable , without a plunge or a caper , or anything like one . Catherine , delighted at so happy an escape , spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise ; and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins , and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip . Catherine , though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse , he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks , congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman ; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner , without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity , and ( considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour ) by no means alarmingly fast , gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind , in a fine mild day of February , with the consciousness of safety . A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue ; it was broken by Thorpe \u2019s saying very abruptly , \u201c Old Allen is as rich as a Jew \u2014 is not he ? \u201d Catherine did not understand him \u2014 and he repeated his question , adding in explanation , \u201c Old Allen , the man you are with . \u201d \u201c Oh ! mr . Allen , you mean . Yes , I believe , he is very rich . \u201d \u201c And no children at all ? \u201d \u201c No \u2014 not any . \u201d \u201c A famous thing for his next heirs . He is _ your _ godfather , is not he ? \u201d \u201c My godfather ! no . \u201d \u201c But you are always very much with them . \u201d \u201c Yes , very much . \u201d \u201c Aye , that is what I meant . He seems a good kind of old fellow enough , and has lived very well in his time , I dare say ; he is not gouty for nothing . Does he drink his bottle a day now ? \u201d \u201c His bottle a day ! no . Why should you think of such a thing ? He is a very temperate man , and you could not fancy him in liquor last night ? \u201d \u201c Lord help you ! you women are always thinking of men \u2019s being in liquor . Why , you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle ? I am sure of _ this_\u2014that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day , there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now . It would be a famous good thing for us all . \u201d \u201c I can not believe it . \u201d \u201c Oh ! lord , it would be the saving of thousands . There is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be . Our foggy climate wants help . \u201d \u201c And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford . \u201d \u201c Oxford ! there is no drinking at Oxford now , I assure you . Nobody drinks there . You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost . Now , for instance , it was reckoned a remarkable thing , at the last party in my rooms , that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head . It was looked upon as something out of the common way . _ Mine _ is famous good stuff , to be sure . You would not often meet with anything like it in Oxford \u2014 and that may account for it . But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there . \u201d \u201c Yes , it does give a notion , \u201d said Catherine warmly , \u201c and that is , that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did . However , I am sure James does not drink so much . \u201d This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply , of which no part was very distinct , except the frequent exclamations , amounting almost to oaths , which adorned it , and Catherine was left , when it ended , with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford , and the same happy conviction of her brother \u2019s comparative sobriety . Thorpe \u2019s ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage , and she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse moved along , and the ease which his paces , as well as the excellence of the springs , gave the motion of the carriage . She followed him in all his admiration as well as she could . To go before or beyond him was impossible . His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject , his rapidity of expression , and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power ; she could strike out nothing new in commendation , but she readily echoed whatever he chose to assert , and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most complete of its kind in England , his carriage the neatest , his horse the best goer , and himself the best coachman . \u201c You do not really think , Mr. Thorpe , \u201d said Catherine , venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided , and to offer some little variation on the subject , \u201c that James \u2019s gig will break down ? \u201d \u201c Break down ! oh , lord ! did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life ? There is not a sound piece of iron about it . The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least \u2014 and as for the body ! upon my soul , you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch . It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld ! thank God ! we have got a better . I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds . \u201d \u201c Good heavens ! \u201d cried Catherine , quite frightened . \u201c Then pray let us turn back ; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on . Do let us turn back , Mr. Thorpe ; stop and speak to my brother , and tell him how very unsafe it is . \u201d \u201c Unsafe ! oh , lord ! what is there in that ? They will only get a roll if it does break down ; and there is plenty of dirt ; it will be excellent falling . Oh , curse it ! the carriage is safe enough , if a man knows how to drive it ; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out . Lord bless you ! i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again , without losing a nail . \u201d Catherine listened with astonishment ; she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing ; for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle , nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead . Her own family were plain , matter - of - fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind ; her father , at the utmost , being contented with a pun , and her mother with a proverb ; they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance , or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next . She reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity , and was more than once on the point of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject ; but she checked herself , because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights , in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous ; and , joining to this , the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve them , she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe , and therefore would alarm herself no longer . By him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten ; and all the rest of his conversation , or rather talk , began and ended with himself and his own concerns . He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums ; of racing matches , in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner ; of shooting parties , in which he had killed more birds ( though without having one good shot ) than all his companions together ; and described to her some famous day \u2019s sport , with the fox - hounds , in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman , and in which the boldness of his riding , though it had never endangered his own life for a moment , had been constantly leading others into difficulties , which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many . Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself , and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be , she could not entirely repress a doubt , while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit , of his being altogether completely agreeable . It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella \u2019s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure . When they arrived at Mrs. Allen \u2019s door , the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed , on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house : \u201c Past three o\u2019clock ! \u201d It was inconceivable , incredible , impossible ! and she would neither believe her own watch , nor her brother \u2019s , nor the servant \u2019s ; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality , till Morland produced his watch , and ascertained the fact ; to have doubted a moment longer _ then _ , would have been equally inconceivable , incredible , and impossible ; and she could only protest , over and over again , that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before , as Catherine was called on to confirm ; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella ; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend \u2019s dissenting voice , by not waiting for her answer . Her own feelings entirely engrossed her ; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home . It was ages since she had had a moment \u2019s conversation with her dearest Catherine ; and , though she had such thousands of things to say to her , it appeared as if they were never to be together again ; so , with smiles of most exquisite misery , and the laughing eye of utter despondency , she bade her friend adieu and went on . Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning , and was immediately greeted with , \u201c Well , my dear , here you are , \u201d a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute ; \u201c and I hope you have had a pleasant airing ? \u201d \u201c Yes , ma\u2019am , I thank you ; we could not have had a nicer day . \u201d \u201c So Mrs. Thorpe said ; she was vastly pleased at your all going . \u201d \u201c You have seen Mrs. Thorpe , then ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I went to the pump - room as soon as you were gone , and there I met her , and we had a great deal of talk together . She says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning , it is so uncommonly scarce . \u201d \u201c Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent , and there we met Mrs. Hughes , and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her . \u201d \u201c Did you indeed ? And did they speak to you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour . They seem very agreeable people . Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin , and I fancy , by what I can learn , that she always dresses very handsomely . Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family . \u201d \u201c And what did she tell you of them ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! a vast deal indeed ; she hardly talked of anything else . \u201d \u201c Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from ? \u201d \u201c Yes , she did ; but I can not recollect now . But they are very good kind of people , and very rich . Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond , and she and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows ; and Miss Drummond had a very large fortune ; and , when she married , her father gave her twenty thousand pounds , and five hundred to buy wedding - clothes . Mrs. Hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse . \u201d \u201c And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I fancy they are , but I am not quite certain . Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . \u201d \u201c And is Mr. Tilney , my partner , the only son ? \u201d \u201c I can not be quite positive about that , my dear ; I have some idea he is ; but , however , he is a very fine young man , Mrs. Hughes says , and likely to do very well . \u201d Catherine inquired no further ; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give , and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister . Could she have foreseen such a circumstance , nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others ; and , as it was , she could only lament her ill luck , and think over what she had lost , till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [17, 20], "text": "the Upper
