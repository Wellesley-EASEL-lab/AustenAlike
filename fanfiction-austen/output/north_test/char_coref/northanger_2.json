{"document": "6 The following conversation , which took place between the two friends in the pump - room one morning , after an acquaintance of eight or nine days , is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment , and of the delicacy , discretion , originality of thought , and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment . They met by appointment ; and as Isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend , her first address naturally was , \u201c My dearest creature , what can have made you so late ? I have been waiting for you at least this age ! \u201d \u201c Have you , indeed ! i am very sorry for it ; but really I thought I was in very good time . It is but just one . I hope you have not been here long ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! these ten ages at least . I am sure I have been here this half hour . But now , let us go and sit down at the other end of the room , and enjoy ourselves . I have an hundred things to say to you . In the first place , I was so afraid it would rain this morning , just as I wanted to set off ; it looked very showery , and that would have thrown me into agonies ! do you know , I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine , in a shop window in Milsom Street just now \u2014 very like yours , only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green ; I quite longed for it . But , my dearest Catherine , what have you been doing with yourself all this morning ? Have you gone on with Udolpho ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I have been reading it ever since I woke ; and I am got to the black veil . \u201d \u201c Are you , indeed ? How delightful ! oh ! i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world ! are not you wild to know ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! yes , quite ; what can it be ? But do not tell me \u2014 I would not be told upon any account . I know it must be a skeleton , I am sure it is Laurentina \u2019s skeleton . Oh ! i am delighted with the book ! i should like to spend my whole life in reading it . I assure you , if it had not been to meet you , I would not have come away from it for all the world . \u201d \u201c Dear creature ! how much I am obliged to you ; and when you have finished Udolpho , we will read the Italian together ; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you . \u201d \u201c Have you , indeed ! how glad I am ! what are they all ? \u201d \u201c I will read you their names directly ; here they are , in my pocketbook . Castle of Wolfenbach , Clermont , Mysterious Warnings , Necromancer of the Black Forest , Midnight Bell , Orphan of the Rhine , and Horrid Mysteries . Those will last us some time . \u201d \u201c Yes , pretty well ; but are they all horrid , are you sure they are all horrid ? \u201d \u201c Yes , quite sure ; for a particular friend of mine , a Miss Andrews , a sweet girl , one of the sweetest creatures in the world , has read every one of them . I wish you knew Miss Andrews , you would be delighted with her . She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive . I think her as beautiful as an angel , and I am so vexed with the men for not admiring her ! i scold them all amazingly about it . \u201d \u201c Scold them ! do you scold them for not admiring her ? \u201d \u201c Yes , that I do . There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends . I have no notion of loving people by halves ; it is not my nature . My attachments are always excessively strong . I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night , I would not dance with him , unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel . The men think us incapable of real friendship , you know , and I am determined to show them the difference . Now , if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you , I should fire up in a moment : but that is not at all likely , for _ you _ are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men . \u201d \u201c Oh , dear ! \u201d cried Catherine , colouring . \u201c How can you say so ? \u201d \u201c I know you very well ; you have so much animation , which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants , for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her . Oh ! i must tell you , that just after we parted yesterday , I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly \u2014 I am sure he is in love with you . \u201d Catherine coloured , and disclaimed again . Isabella laughed . \u201c It is very true , upon my honour , but I see how it is ; you are indifferent to everybody \u2019s admiration , except that of one gentleman , who shall be nameless . Nay , I can not blame you\u201d\u2014speaking more seriously\u2014\u201cyour feelings are easily understood . Where the heart is really attached , I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else . Everything is so insipid , so uninteresting , that does not relate to the beloved object ! i can perfectly comprehend your feelings . \u201d \u201c But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney , for perhaps I may never see him again . \u201d \u201c Not see him again ! my dearest creature , do not talk of it . I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so ! \u201d \u201c No , indeed , I should not . I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him ; but while I have Udolpho to read , I feel as if nobody could make me miserable . Oh ! the dreadful black veil ! my dear Isabella , I am sure there must be Laurentina \u2019s skeleton behind it . \u201d \u201c It is so odd to me , that you should never have read Udolpho before ; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels . \u201d \u201c No , she does not . She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself ; but new books do not fall in our way . \u201d \u201c Sir Charles Grandison ! that is an amazing horrid book , is it not ? I remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume . \u201d \u201c It is not like Udolpho at all ; but yet I think it is very entertaining . \u201d \u201c Do you indeed ! you surprise me ; I thought it had not been readable . But , my dearest Catherine , have you settled what to wear on your head to - night ? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you . The men take notice of _ that _ sometimes , you know . \u201d \u201c But it does not signify if they do , \u201d said Catherine , very innocently . \u201c Signify ! oh , heavens ! i make it a rule never to mind what they say . They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit , and make them keep their distance . \u201d \u201c Are they ? Well , I never observed _ that _ . They always behave very well to me . \u201d \u201c Oh ! they give themselves such airs . They are the most conceited creatures in the world , and think themselves of so much importance ! by the by , though I have thought of it a hundred times , I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man . Do you like them best dark or fair ? \u201d \u201c I hardly know . I never much thought about it . Something between both , I think . Brown \u2014 not fair , and \u2014 and not very dark . \u201d \u201c Very well , Catherine . That is exactly he . I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney\u2014\u2018a brown skin , with dark eyes , and rather dark hair . \u2019 Well , my taste is different . I prefer light eyes , and as to complexion \u2014 do you know \u2014 I like a sallow better than any other . You must not betray me , if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description . \u201d \u201c Betray you ! what do you mean ? \u201d \u201c Nay , do not distress me . I believe I have said too much . Let us drop the subject . \u201d Catherine , in some amazement , complied , and after remaining a few moments silent , was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world , Laurentina \u2019s skeleton , when her friend prevented her , by saying , \u201c For heaven \u2019s sake ! Let us move away from this end of the room . Do you know , there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour . They really put me quite out of countenance . Let us go and look at the arrivals . They will hardly follow us there . \u201d Away they walked to the book ; and while Isabella examined the names , it was Catherine \u2019s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men . \u201c They are not coming this way , are they ? I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us . Pray let me know if they are coming . I am determined I will not look up . \u201d In a few moments Catherine , with unaffected pleasure , assured her that she need not be longer uneasy , as the gentlemen had just left the pump - room . \u201c And which way are they gone ? \u201d said Isabella , turning hastily round . \u201c One was a very good - looking young man . \u201d \u201c They went towards the church - yard . \u201d \u201c Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them ! and now , what say you to going to Edgar \u2019s Buildings with me , and looking at my new hat ? You said you should like to see it . \u201d Catherine readily agreed . \u201c Only , \u201d she added , \u201c perhaps we may overtake the two young men . \u201d \u201c Oh ! never mind that . If we make haste , we shall pass by them presently , and I am dying to show you my hat . \u201d \u201c But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . \u201d \u201c I shall not pay them any such compliment , I assure you . I have no notion of treating men with such respect . _ That _ is the way to spoil them . \u201d Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning ; and therefore , to show the independence of Miss Thorpe , and her resolution of humbling the sex , they set off immediately as fast as they could walk , in pursuit of the two young men . 7 Half a minute conducted them through the pump - yard to the archway , opposite Union Passage ; but here they were stopped . Everybody acquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street at this point ; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature , so unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads , and the principal inn of the city , that a day never passes in which parties of ladies , however important their business , whether in quest of pastry , millinery , or even ( as in the present case ) of young men , are not detained on one side or other by carriages , horsemen , or carts . This evil had been felt and lamented , at least three times a day , by Isabella since her residence in Bath ; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more , for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage , and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds , and threading the gutters of that interesting alley , they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig , driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing - looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself , his companion , and his horse . \u201c Oh , these odious gigs ! \u201d said Isabella , looking up . \u201c How I detest them . \u201d But this detestation , though so just , was of short duration , for she looked again and exclaimed , \u201c Delightful ! mr . Morland and my brother ! \u201d \u201c Good heaven ! \u2019 Tis James ! \u201d was uttered at the same moment by Catherine ; and , on catching the young men \u2019s eyes , the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches , and the servant having now scampered up , the gentlemen jumped out , and the equipage was delivered to his care . Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people \u2019s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself . John Thorpe , who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses , soon joined them , and from him she directly received the amends which were her due ; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella , on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow . He was a stout young man of middling height , who , with a plain face and ungraceful form , seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom , and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil , and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy . He took out his watch : \u201c How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury , Miss Morland ? \u201d \u201c I do not know the distance . \u201d Her brother told her that it was twenty - three miles . \u201c _ Three_-and - twenty ! \u201d cried Thorpe , \u201c five - and - twenty if it is an inch . \u201d Morland remonstrated , pleaded the authority of road - books , innkeepers , and milestones ; but his friend disregarded them all ; he had a surer test of distance . \u201c I know it must be five - and - twenty , \u201d said he , \u201c by the time we have been doing it . It is now half after one ; we drove out of the inn - yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven ; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness ; that makes it exactly twenty - five . \u201d \u201c You have lost an hour , \u201d said Morland ; \u201c it was only ten o\u2019clock when we came from Tetbury . \u201d \u201c Ten o\u2019clock ! it was eleven , upon my soul ! i counted every stroke . This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses , Miss Morland ; do but look at my horse ; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life ? \u201d ( The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving off . ) \u201c Such true blood ! three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles ! look at that creature , and suppose it possible if you can . \u201d \u201c He _ does _ look very hot , to be sure . \u201d \u201c Hot ! he had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church ; but look at his forehand ; look at his loins ; only see how he moves ; that horse _ can not _ go less than ten miles an hour : tie his legs and he will get on . What do you think of my gig , Miss Morland ? A neat one , is not it ? Well hung ; town - built ; I have not had it a month . It was built for a Christchurch man , a friend of mine , a very good sort of fellow ; he ran it a few weeks , till , I believe , it was convenient to have done with it . I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind , though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too ; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge , as he was driving into Oxford , last term : \u2018 Ah ! thorpe , \u2019 said he , \u2018 do you happen to want such a little thing as this ? It is a capital one of the kind , but I am cursed tired of it . \u2019 \u2018 Oh ! d \u2014 , \u2019 said I ; \u2018 I am your man ; what do you ask ? \u2019 And how much do you think he did , Miss Morland ? \u201d \u201c I am sure I can not guess at all . \u201d \u201c Curricle - hung , you see ; seat , trunk , sword - case , splashing - board , lamps , silver moulding , all you see complete ; the iron - work as good as new , or better . He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . \u201d \u201c And I am sure , \u201d said Catherine , \u201c I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . \u201d \u201c Neither one nor t\u2019other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . \u201d \u201c That was very good - natured of you , \u201d said Catherine , quite pleased . \u201c Oh ! d \u2014 \u2014 it , when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend , I hate to be pitiful . \u201d An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young ladies ; and , on finding whither they were going , it was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar \u2019s Buildings , and pay their respects to Mrs. Thorpe . James and Isabella led the way ; and so well satisfied was the latter with her lot , so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother \u2019s friend , and her friend \u2019s brother , so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings , that , though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street , she was so far from seeking to attract their notice , that she looked back at them only three times . John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine , and , after a few minutes \u2019 silence , renewed the conversation about his gig . \u201c You will find , however , Miss Morland , it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people , for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day ; Jackson , of Oriel , bid me sixty at once ; Morland was with me at the time . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d said Morland , who overheard this ; \u201c but you forget that your horse was included . \u201d \u201c My horse ! oh , d \u2014 \u2014 it ! i would not sell my horse for a hundred . Are you fond of an open carriage , Miss Morland ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very ; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one ; but I am particularly fond of it . \u201d \u201c I am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . \u201d \u201c Thank you , \u201d said Catherine , in some distress , from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer . \u201c I will drive you up Lansdown Hill to - morrow . \u201d \u201c Thank you ; but will not your horse want rest ? \u201d \u201c Rest ! he has only come three and twenty miles to - day ; all nonsense ; nothing ruins horses so much as rest ; nothing knocks them up so soon . No , no ; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here . \u201d \u201c Shall you indeed ! \u201d said Catherine very seriously . \u201c That will be forty miles a day . \u201d \u201c Forty ! aye , fifty , for what I care . Well , I will drive you up Lansdown to - morrow ; mind , I am engaged . \u201d \u201c How delightful that will be ! \u201d cried Isabella , turning round . \u201c My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother , you will not have room for a third . \u201d \u201c A third indeed ! no , no ; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about ; that would be a good joke , faith ! morland must take care of you . \u201d This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two ; but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result . Her companion \u2019s discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met ; and Catherine , after listening and agreeing as long as she could , with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind , fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self - assured man , especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned , ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts ; it was , \u201c Have you ever read Udolpho , Mr. Thorpe ? \u201d \u201c Udolpho ! oh , Lord ! not I ; I never read novels ; I have something else to do . \u201d Catherine , humbled and ashamed , was going to apologize for her question , but he prevented her by saying , \u201c Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff ; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones , except The Monk ; I read that t\u2019other day ; but as for all the others , they are the stupidest things in creation . \u201d \u201c I think you must like Udolpho , if you were to read it ; it is so very interesting . \u201d \u201c Not I , faith ! no , if I read any , it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe \u2019s ; her novels are amusing enough ; they are worth reading ; some fun and nature in _ them _ . \u201d \u201c Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe , \u201d said Catherine , with some hesitation , from the fear of mortifying him . \u201c No , sure ; was it ? Aye , I remember , so it was ; I was thinking of that other stupid book , written by that woman they make such a fuss about , she who married the French emigrant . \u201d \u201c I suppose you mean Camilla ? \u201d \u201c Yes , that \u2019s the book ; such unnatural stuff ! an old man playing at see - saw , I took up the first volume once and looked it over , but I soon found it would not do ; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it : as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant , I was sure I should never be able to get through it . \u201d \u201c I have never read it . \u201d \u201c You had no loss , I assure you ; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine ; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man \u2019s playing at see - saw and learning Latin ; upon my soul there is not . \u201d This critique , the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine , brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe \u2019s lodgings , and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son , as they met Mrs. Thorpe , who had descried them from above , in the passage . \u201c Ah , Mother ! How do you do ? \u201d said he , giving her a hearty shake of the hand . \u201c Where did you get that quiz of a hat ? It makes you look like an old witch . Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you , so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near . \u201d And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother \u2019s heart , for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection . On his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness , for he asked each of them how they did , and observed that they both looked very ugly . These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James \u2019s friend and Isabella \u2019s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella \u2019s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John \u2019s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening . Had she been older or vainer , such attacks might have done little ; but , where youth and diffidence are united , it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world , and of being so very early engaged as a partner ; and the consequence was that , when the two Morlands , after sitting an hour with the Thorpes , set off to walk together to Mr. Allen \u2019s , and James , as the door was closed on them , said , \u201c Well , Catherine , how do you like my friend Thorpe ? \u201d instead of answering , as she probably would have done , had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case , \u201c I do not like him at all , \u201d she directly replied , \u201c I like him very much ; he seems very agreeable . \u201d \u201c He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? \u201d \u201c Very , very much indeed : Isabella particularly . \u201d \u201c I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you . She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be ; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you , Catherine , \u201d taking her hand with affection , \u201c may be proud of . \u201d \u201c Indeed I am , \u201d she replied ; \u201c I love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too . You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . \u201d \u201c Because I thought I should soon see you myself . I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath . She is a most amiable girl ; such a superior understanding ! how fond all the family are of her ; she is evidently the general favourite ; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this \u2014 is not she ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very much indeed , I fancy ; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath . \u201d \u201c I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very kind ; I never was so happy before ; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever ; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _ me _ . \u201d James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , \u201c Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . \u201d Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James \u2019s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet . A pre - engagement in Edgar \u2019s Buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend , and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other . The time of the two parties uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted , Catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised , restless , and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho , lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner , incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen \u2019s fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker , and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity , in being already engaged for the evening . 8 In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker , however , the party from Pulteney Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time . The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before them ; and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste , of admiring the set of her gown , and envying the curl of her hair , they followed their chaperons , arm in arm , into the ballroom , whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred , and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection . The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated ; and James , who had been engaged quite as long as his sister , was very importunate with Isabella to stand up ; but John was gone into the card - room to speak to a friend , and nothing , she declared , should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too . \u201c I assure you , \u201d said she , \u201c I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world ; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening . \u201d Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude , and they continued as they were for three minutes longer , when Isabella , who had been talking to James on the other side of her , turned again to his sister and whispered , \u201c My dear creature , I am afraid I must leave you , your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin ; I know you will not mind my going away , and I dare say John will be back in a moment , and then you may easily find me out . \u201d Catherine , though a little disappointed , had too much good nature to make any opposition , and the others rising up , Isabella had only time to press her friend \u2019s hand and say , \u201c Good - bye , my dear love , \u201d before they hurried off . The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing , Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen , between whom she now remained . She could not help being vexed at the non - appearance of Mr. Thorpe , for she not only longed to be dancing , but was likewise aware that , as the real dignity of her situation could not be known , she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner . To be disgraced in the eye of the world , to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity , her actions all innocence , and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement , is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine \u2019s life , and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character . Catherine had fortitude too ; she suffered , but no murmur passed her lips . From this state of humiliation , she was roused , at the end of ten minutes , to a pleasanter feeling , by seeing , not Mr. Thorpe , but Mr. Tilney , within three yards of the place where they sat ; he seemed to be moving that way , but he did not see her , and therefore the smile and the blush , which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine , passed away without sullying her heroic importance . He looked as handsome and as lively as ever , and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing - looking young woman , who leant on his arm , and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister ; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever , by being married already . But guided only by what was simple and probable , it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married ; he had not behaved , he had not talked , like the married men to whom she had been used ; he had never mentioned a wife , and he had acknowledged a sister . From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister \u2019s now being by his side ; and therefore , instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen \u2019s bosom , Catherine sat erect , in the perfect use of her senses , and with cheeks only a little redder than usual . Mr. Tilney and his companion , who continued , though slowly , to approach , were immediately preceded by a lady , an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe ; and this lady stopping to speak to her , they , as belonging to her , stopped likewise , and Catherine , catching Mr. Tilney \u2019s eye , instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition . She returned it with pleasure , and then advancing still nearer , he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen , by whom he was very civilly acknowledged . \u201c I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . \u201d He thanked her for her fears , and said that he had quitted it for a week , on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her . \u201c Well , sir , and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again , for it is just the place for young people \u2014 and indeed for everybody else too . I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health . \u201d \u201c And I hope , madam , that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place , from finding it of service to him . \u201d \u201c Thank you , sir . I have no doubt that he will . A neighbour of ours , Dr. Skinner , was here for his health last winter , and came away quite stout . \u201d \u201c That circumstance must give great encouragement . \u201d \u201c Yes , sir \u2014 and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months ; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away . \u201d Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen , that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats , as they had agreed to join their party . This was accordingly done , Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them ; and after a few minutes \u2019 consideration , he asked Catherine to dance with him . This compliment , delightful as it was , produced severe mortification to the lady ; and in giving her denial , she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it , that had Thorpe , who joined her just afterwards , been half a minute earlier , he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute . The very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot ; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up , of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left , and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them , interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney . Of her dear Isabella , to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman , she could see nothing . They were in different sets . She was separated from all her party , and away from all her acquaintance ; one mortification succeeded another , and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson , that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady . From such a moralizing strain as this , she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder , and turning round , perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her , attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman . \u201c I beg your pardon , Miss Morland , \u201d said she , \u201c for this liberty \u2014 but I can not anyhow get to Miss Thorpe , and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you . \u201d Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine . The young ladies were introduced to each other , Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness , Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation ; and Mrs. Hughes , satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge , returned to her party . Miss Tilney had a good figure , a pretty face , and a very agreeable countenance ; and her air , though it had not all the decided pretension , the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe \u2019s , had more real elegance . Her manners showed good sense and good breeding ; they were neither shy nor affectedly open ; and she seemed capable of being young , attractive , and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her , and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence . Catherine , interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney , was desirous of being acquainted with her , and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say , and had courage and leisure for saying it . But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy , by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites , prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance , by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath , how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country , whether she drew , or played , or sang , and whether she was fond of riding on horseback . The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella , who in great spirits exclaimed , \u201c At last I have got you . My dearest creature , I have been looking for you this hour . What could induce you to come into this set , when you knew I was in the other ? I have been quite wretched without you . \u201d \u201c My dear Isabella , how was it possible for me to get at you ? I could not even see where you were . \u201d \u201c So I told your brother all the time \u2014 but he would not believe me . Do go and see for her , Mr. Morland , said I \u2014 but all in vain \u2014 he would not stir an inch . Was not it so , Mr. Morland ? But you men are all so immoderately lazy ! i have been scolding him to such a degree , my dear Catherine , you would be quite amazed . You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people . \u201d \u201c Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head , \u201d whispered Catherine , detaching her friend from James . \u201c It is Mr. Tilney \u2019s sister . \u201d \u201c Oh ! heavens ! you do n\u2019t say so ! let me look at her this moment . What a delightful girl ! i never saw anything half so beautiful ! but where is her all - conquering brother ? Is he in the room ? Point him out to me this instant , if he is . I die to see him . Mr. Morland , you are not to listen . We are not talking about you . \u201d \u201c But what is all this whispering about ? What is going on ? \u201d \u201c There now , I knew how it would be . You men have such restless curiosity ! talk of the curiosity of women , indeed ! \u2019 Tis nothing . But be satisfied , for you are not to know anything at all of the matter . \u201d \u201c And is that likely to satisfy me , do you think ? \u201d \u201c Well , I declare I never knew anything like you . What can it signify to you , what we are talking of . Perhaps we are talking about you ; therefore I would advise you not to listen , or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable . \u201d In this commonplace chatter , which lasted some time , the original subject seemed entirely forgotten ; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while , she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella \u2019s impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney . When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance , James would have led his fair partner away , but she resisted . \u201c I tell you , Mr. Morland , \u201d she cried , \u201c I would not do such a thing for all the world . How can you be so teasing ; only conceive , my dear Catherine , what your brother wants me to do . He wants me to dance with him again , though I tell him that it is a most improper thing , and entirely against the rules . It would make us the talk of the place , if we were not to change partners . \u201d \u201c Upon my honour , \u201d said James , \u201c in these public assemblies , it is as often done as not . \u201d \u201c Nonsense , how can you say so ? But when you men have a point to carry , you never stick at anything . My sweet Catherine , do support me ; persuade your brother how impossible it is . Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing ; now would not it ? \u201d \u201c No , not at all ; but if you think it wrong , you had much better change . \u201d \u201c There , \u201d cried Isabella , \u201c you hear what your sister says , and yet you will not mind her . Well , remember that it is not my fault , if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle . Come along , my dearest Catherine , for heaven \u2019s sake , and stand by me . \u201d And off they went , to regain their former place . John Thorpe , in the meanwhile , had walked away ; and Catherine , ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once , made her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could , in the hope of finding him still with them \u2014 a hope which , when it proved to be fruitless , she felt to have been highly unreasonable . \u201c Well , my dear , \u201d said Mrs. Thorpe , impatient for praise of her son , \u201c I hope you have had an agreeable partner . \u201d \u201c Very agreeable , madam . \u201d \u201c I am glad of it . John has charming spirits , has not he ? \u201d \u201c Did you meet Mr. Tilney , my dear ? \u201d said Mrs. Allen . \u201c No , where is he ? \u201d \u201c He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . \u201d \u201c Where can he be ? \u201d said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance . \u201c Ah ! he has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , \u201d said Mrs. Allen ; and after a short silence , she added , \u201c he is a very agreeable young man . \u201d \u201c Indeed he is , Mrs. Allen , \u201d said Mrs. Thorpe , smiling complacently ; \u201c I must say it , though I _ am _ his mother , that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world . \u201d This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many ; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen , for after only a moment \u2019s consideration , she said , in a whisper to Catherine , \u201c I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son . \u201d Catherine was disappointed and vexed . She seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view ; and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply , when John Thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said , \u201c Well , Miss Morland , I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again . \u201d \u201c Oh , no ; I am much obliged to you , our two dances are over ; and , besides , I am tired , and do not mean to dance any more . \u201d \u201c Do not you ? Then let us walk about and quiz people . Come along with me , and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room ; my two younger sisters and their partners . I have been laughing at them this half hour . \u201d Again Catherine excused herself ; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself . The rest of the evening she found very dull ; Mr. Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea , to attend that of his partner ; Miss Tilney , though belonging to it , did not sit near her , and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile , one squeeze , and one \u201c dearest Catherine . \u201d",
