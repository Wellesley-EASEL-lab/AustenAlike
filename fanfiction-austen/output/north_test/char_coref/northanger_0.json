{"document": "\ufeff [ Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen ( 1803 ) ] 1 No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine . Her situation in life , the character of her father and mother , her own person and disposition , were all equally against her . Her father was a clergyman , without being neglected , or poor , and a very respectable man , though his name was Richard \u2014 and he had never been handsome . He had a considerable independence besides two good livings \u2014 and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters . Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense , with a good temper , and , what is more remarkable , with a good constitution . She had three sons before Catherine was born ; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world , as anybody might expect , she still lived on \u2014 lived to have six children more \u2014 to see them growing up around her , and to enjoy excellent health herself . A family of ten children will be always called a fine family , where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number ; but the Morlands had little other right to the word , for they were in general very plain , and Catherine , for many years of her life , as plain as any . She had a thin awkward figure , a sallow skin without colour , dark lank hair , and strong features \u2014 so much for her person ; and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind . She was fond of all boys \u2019 plays , and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls , but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy , nursing a dormouse , feeding a canary - bird , or watering a rose - bush . Indeed she had no taste for a garden ; and if she gathered flowers at all , it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief \u2014 at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take . Such were her propensities \u2014 her abilities were quite as extraordinary . She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught ; and sometimes not even then , for she was often inattentive , and occasionally stupid . Her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the \u201c Beggar \u2019s Petition \u201d ; and after all , her next sister , Sally , could say it better than she did . Not that Catherine was always stupid \u2014 by no means ; she learnt the fable of \u201c The Hare and Many Friends \u201d as quickly as any girl in England . Her mother wished her to learn music ; and Catherine was sure she should like it , for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet ; so , at eight years old she began . She learnt a year , and could not bear it ; and Mrs. Morland , who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste , allowed her to leave off . The day which dismissed the music - master was one of the happiest of Catherine \u2019s life . Her taste for drawing was not superior ; though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper , she did what she could in that way , by drawing houses and trees , hens and chickens , all very much like one another . Writing and accounts she was taught by her father ; French by her mother : her proficiency in either was not remarkable , and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could . What a strange , unaccountable character!\u2014for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old , she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper , was seldom stubborn , scarcely ever quarrelsome , and very kind to the little ones , with few interruptions of tyranny ; she was moreover noisy and wild , hated confinement and cleanliness , and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house . Such was Catherine Morland at ten . At fifteen , appearances were mending ; she began to curl her hair and long for balls ; her complexion improved , her features were softened by plumpness and colour , her eyes gained more animation , and her figure more consequence . Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery , and she grew clean as she grew smart ; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement . \u201c Catherine grows quite a good - looking girl \u2014 she is almost pretty to - day , \u201d were words which caught her ears now and then ; and how welcome were the sounds ! to look _ almost _ pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive . Mrs. Morland was a very good woman , and wished to see her children everything they ought to be ; but her time was so much occupied in lying - in and teaching the little ones , that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves ; and it was not very wonderful that Catherine , who had by nature nothing heroic about her , should prefer cricket , baseball , riding on horseback , and running about the country at the age of fourteen , to books \u2014 or at least books of information \u2014 for , provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them , provided they were all story and no reflection , she had never any objection to books at all . But from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine ; she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives . From Pope , she learnt to censure those who \u201c bear about the mockery of woe . \u201d From Gray , that \u201c Many a flower is born to blush unseen , \u201c And waste its fragrance on the desert air . \u201d From Thomson , that \u2014 \u201c It is a delightful task \u201c To teach the young idea how to shoot . \u201d And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information \u2014 amongst the rest , that \u2014 \u201c Trifles light as air , \u201c Are , to the jealous , confirmation strong , \u201c As proofs of Holy Writ . \u201d That \u201c The poor beetle , which we tread upon , \u201c In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great \u201c As when a giant dies . \u201d And that a young woman in love always looks \u2014 \u201c like Patience on a monument \u201c Smiling at Grief . \u201d So far her improvement was sufficient \u2014 and in many other points she came on exceedingly well ; for though she could not write sonnets , she brought herself to read them ; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte , of her own composition , she could listen to other people \u2019s performance with very little fatigue . Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil \u2014 she had no notion of drawing \u2014 not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover \u2019s profile , that she might be detected in the design . There she fell miserably short of the true heroic height . At present she did not know her own poverty , for she had no lover to portray . She had reached the age of seventeen , without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility , without having inspired one real passion , and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient . This was strange indeed ! but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out . There was not one lord in the neighbourhood ; no \u2014 not even a baronet . There was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door \u2014 not one young man whose origin was unknown . Her father had no ward , and the squire of the parish no children . But when a young lady is to be a heroine , the perverseness of forty surrounding families can not prevent her . Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way . Mr. Allen , who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton , the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived , was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution \u2014 and his lady , a good - humoured woman , fond of Miss Morland , and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village , she must seek them abroad , invited her to go with them . Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance , and Catherine all happiness . 2 In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland \u2019s personal and mental endowments , when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks \u2019 residence in Bath , it may be stated , for the reader \u2019s more certain information , lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be , that her heart was affectionate ; her disposition cheerful and open , without conceit or affectation of any kind \u2014 her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl ; her person pleasing , and , when in good looks , pretty \u2014 and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is . When the hour of departure drew near , the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe . A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness , and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together ; and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet . Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm - house , must , at such a moment , relieve the fulness of her heart . Who would not think so ? But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets , that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness , and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations . Her cautions were confined to the following points . \u201c I beg , Catherine , you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat , when you come from the Rooms at night ; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend ; I will give you this little book on purpose . \u201d Sally , or rather Sarah ( for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can ? ) , must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister . It is remarkable , however , that she neither insisted on Catherine \u2019s writing by every post , nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance , nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce . Everything indeed relative to this important journey was done , on the part of the Morlands , with a degree of moderation and composure , which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life , than with the refined susceptibilities , the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite . Her father , instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker , or even putting an hundred pounds bank - bill into her hands , gave her only ten guineas , and promised her more when she wanted it . Under these unpromising auspices , the parting took place , and the journey began . It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety . Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them , nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero . Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear , on Mrs. Allen \u2019s side , of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn , and that fortunately proved to be groundless . They arrived at Bath . Catherine was all eager delight \u2014 her eyes were here , there , everywhere , as they approached its fine and striking environs , and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel . She was come to be happy , and she felt happy already . They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street . It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen , that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work , and how she will , probably , contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable \u2014 whether by her imprudence , vulgarity , or jealousy \u2014 whether by intercepting her letters , ruining her character , or turning her out of doors . Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females , whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them . She had neither beauty , genius , accomplishment , nor manner . The air of a gentlewoman , a great deal of quiet , inactive good temper , and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible , intelligent man like Mr. Allen . In one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public , being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be . Dress was her passion . She had a most harmless delight in being fine ; and our heroine \u2019s entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn , and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion . Catherine too made some purchases herself , and when all these matters were arranged , the important evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms . Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand , her clothes put on with care , and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do . With such encouragement , Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd . As for admiration , it was always very welcome when it came , but she did not depend on it . Mrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late . The season was full , the room crowded , and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could . As for Mr. Allen , he repaired directly to the card - room , and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves . With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e , Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by the door , as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow ; Catherine , however , kept close at her side , and linked her arm too firmly within her friend \u2019s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly . But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd ; it seemed rather to increase as they went on , whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door , they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience . But this was far from being the case , and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room , their situation was just the same ; they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies . Still they moved on \u2014 something better was yet in view ; and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench . Here there was something less of crowd than below ; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her , and of all the dangers of her late passage through them . It was a splendid sight , and she began , for the first time that evening , to feel herself at a ball : she longed to dance , but she had not an acquaintance in the room . Mrs. Allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly , every now and then , \u201c I wish you could dance , my dear \u2014 I wish you could get a partner . \u201d For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes ; but they were repeated so often , and proved so totally ineffectual , that Catherine grew tired at last , and would thank her no more . They were not long able , however , to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained . Everybody was shortly in motion for tea , and they must squeeze out like the rest . Catherine began to feel something of disappointment \u2014 she was tired of being continually pressed against by people , the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest , and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives ; and when at last arrived in the tea - room , she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join , no acquaintance to claim , no gentleman to assist them . They saw nothing of Mr. Allen ; and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation , were obliged to sit down at the end of a table , at which a large party were already placed , without having anything to do there , or anybody to speak to , except each other . Mrs. Allen congratulated herself , as soon as they were seated , on having preserved her gown from injury . \u201c It would have been very shocking to have it torn , \u201d said she , \u201c would not it ? It is such a delicate muslin . For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room , I assure you . \u201d \u201c How uncomfortable it is , \u201d whispered Catherine , \u201c not to have a single acquaintance here ! \u201d \u201c Yes , my dear , \u201d replied Mrs. Allen , with perfect serenity , \u201c it is very uncomfortable indeed . \u201d \u201c What shall we do ? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here \u2014 we seem forcing ourselves into their party . \u201d \u201c Aye , so we do . That is very disagreeable . I wish we had a large acquaintance here . \u201d \u201c I wish we had _ any;_\u2014it would be somebody to go to . \u201d \u201c Very true , my dear ; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly . The Skinners were here last year \u2014 I wish they were here now . \u201d \u201c Had not we better go away as it is ? Here are no tea - things for us , you see . \u201d \u201c No more there are , indeed . How very provoking ! but I think we had better sit still , for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd ! how is my head , my dear ? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it , I am afraid . \u201d \u201c No , indeed , it looks very nice . But , dear Mrs. Allen , are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people ? I think you _ must _ know somebody . \u201d \u201c I do n\u2019t , upon my word \u2014 I wish I did . I wish I had a large acquaintance here with all my heart , and then I should get you a partner . I should be so glad to have you dance . There goes a strange - looking woman ! what an odd gown she has got on ! how old - fashioned it is ! look at the back . \u201d After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours ; it was thankfully accepted , and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it , which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening , till they were discovered and joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over . \u201c Well , Miss Morland , \u201d said he , directly , \u201c I hope you have had an agreeable ball . \u201d \u201c Very agreeable indeed , \u201d she replied , vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn . \u201c I wish she had been able to dance , \u201d said his wife ; \u201c I wish we could have got a partner for her . I have been saying how glad I should be if the Skinners were here this winter instead of last ; or if the Parrys had come , as they talked of once , she might have danced with George Parry . I am so sorry she has not had a partner ! \u201d \u201c We shall do better another evening I hope , \u201d was Mr. Allen \u2019s consolation . The company began to disperse when the dancing was over \u2014 enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort ; and now was the time for a heroine , who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening , to be noticed and admired . Every five minutes , by removing some of the crowd , gave greater openings for her charms . She was now seen by many young men who had not been near her before . Not one , however , started with rapturous wonder on beholding her , no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room , nor was she once called a divinity by anybody . Yet Catherine was in very good looks , and had the company only seen her three years before , they would _ now _ have thought her exceedingly handsome . She _ was _ looked at , however , and with some admiration ; for , in her own hearing , two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl . Such words had their due effect ; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before \u2014 her humble vanity was contented \u2014 she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms , and went to her chair in good humour with everybody , and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [18, 20], "text": "Catherine Morland"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text": "her"}, {"position": [26, 27], "text": "her"},
