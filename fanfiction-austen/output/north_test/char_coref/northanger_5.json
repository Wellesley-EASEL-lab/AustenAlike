{"document": "10 The Allens , Thorpes , and Morlands all met in the evening at the theatre ; and , as Catherine and Isabella sat together , there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them . \u201c Oh , heavens ! my beloved Catherine , have I got you at last ? \u201d was her address on Catherine \u2019s entering the box and sitting by her . \u201c Now , Mr. Morland , \u201d for he was close to her on the other side , \u201c I shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening ; so I charge you not to expect it . My sweetest Catherine , how have you been this long age ? But I need not ask you , for you look delightfully . You really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever ; you mischievous creature , do you want to attract everybody ? I assure you , my brother is quite in love with you already ; and as for Mr. Tilney \u2014 but _ that _ is a settled thing \u2014 even _ your _ modesty can not doubt his attachment now ; his coming back to Bath makes it too plain . Oh ! what would not I give to see him ! I really am quite wild with impatience . My mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world ; she saw him this morning , you know ; you must introduce him to me . Is he in the house now ? Look about , for heaven \u2019s sake ! i assure you , I can hardly exist till I see him . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said Catherine , \u201c he is not here ; I can not see him anywhere . \u201d \u201c Oh , horrid ! am I never to be acquainted with him ? How do you like my gown ? I think it does not look amiss ; the sleeves were entirely my own thought . Do you know , I get so immoderately sick of Bath ; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that , though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks , we would not live here for millions . We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place ; really , our opinions were so exactly the same , it was quite ridiculous ! there was not a single point in which we differed ; I would not have had you by for the world ; you are such a sly thing , I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it . \u201d \u201c No , indeed I should not . \u201d \u201c Oh , yes you would indeed ; I know you better than you know yourself . You would have told us that we seemed born for each other , or some nonsense of that kind , which would have distressed me beyond conception ; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses ; I would not have had you by for the world . \u201d \u201c Indeed you do me injustice ; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account ; and besides , I am sure it would never have entered my head . \u201d Isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to James . Catherine \u2019s resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning ; and till the usual moment of going to the pump - room , she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention . But nothing of that kind occurred , no visitors appeared to delay them , and they all three set off in good time for the pump - room , where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place ; Mr. Allen , after drinking his glass of water , joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers ; and the ladies walked about together , noticing every new face , and almost every new bonnet in the room . The female part of the Thorpe family , attended by James Morland , appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour , and Catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend . James , who was now in constant attendance , maintained a similar position , and separating themselves from the rest of their party , they walked in that manner for some time , till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which , confining her entirely to her friend and brother , gave her very little share in the notice of either . They were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute , but their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices , and their vivacity attended with so much laughter , that though Catherine \u2019s supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other , she was never able to give any , from not having heard a word of the subject . At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend , by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney , whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs. Hughes , and whom she instantly joined , with a firmer determination to be acquainted , than she might have had courage to command , had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before . Miss Tilney met her with great civility , returned her advances with equal goodwill , and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room ; and though in all probability not an observation was made , nor an expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of times before , under that roof , in every Bath season , yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth , and without personal conceit , might be something uncommon . \u201c How well your brother dances ! \u201d was an artless exclamation of Catherine \u2019s towards the close of their conversation , which at once surprised and amused her companion . \u201c Henry ! \u201d she replied with a smile . \u201c Yes , he does dance very well . \u201d \u201c He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening , when he saw me sitting down . But I really had been engaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe . \u201d Miss Tilney could only bow . \u201c You can not think , \u201d added Catherine after a moment \u2019s silence , \u201c how surprised I was to see him again . I felt so sure of his being quite gone away . \u201d \u201c When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before , he was in Bath but for a couple of days . He came only to engage lodgings for us . \u201d \u201c _ That _ never occurred to me ; and of course , not seeing him anywhere , I thought he must be gone . Was not the young lady he danced with on Monday a Miss Smith ? \u201d \u201c Yes , an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes . \u201d \u201c I dare say she was very glad to dance . Do you think her pretty ? \u201d \u201c Not very . \u201d \u201c He never comes to the pump - room , I suppose ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sometimes ; but he has rid out this morning with my father . \u201d Mrs. Hughes now joined them , and asked Miss Tilney if she was ready to go . \u201c I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon , \u201d said Catherine . \u201c Shall you be at the cotillion ball to - morrow ? \u201d \u201c Perhaps we \u2014 Yes , I think we certainly shall . \u201d \u201c I am glad of it , for we shall all be there . \u201d This civility was duly returned ; and they parted \u2014 on Miss Tilney \u2019s side with some knowledge of her new acquaintance \u2019s feelings , and on Catherine \u2019s , without the smallest consciousness of having explained them . She went home very happy . The morning had answered all her hopes , and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation , the future good . What gown and what head - dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern . She can not be justified in it . Dress is at all times a frivolous distinction , and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim . Catherine knew all this very well ; her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas before ; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin , and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening . This would have been an error in judgment , great though not uncommon , from which one of the other sex rather than her own , a brother rather than a great aunt , might have warned her , for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown . It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies , could they be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire ; how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin , and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted , the sprigged , the mull , or the jackonet . Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone . No man will admire her the more , no woman will like her the better for it . Neatness and fashion are enough for the former , and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter . But not one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine . She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before . She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe , and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight , lest he should engage her again ; for though she could not , dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to dance , her wishes , hopes , and plans all centred in nothing less . Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment , for every young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation . All have been , or at least all have believed themselves to be , in danger from the pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid ; and all have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please . As soon as they were joined by the Thorpes , Catherine \u2019s agony began ; she fidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her , hid herself as much as possible from his view , and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him . The cotillions were over , the country - dancing beginning , and she saw nothing of the Tilneys . \u201c Do not be frightened , my dear Catherine , \u201d whispered Isabella , \u201c but I am really going to dance with your brother again . I declare positively it is quite shocking . I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself , but you and John must keep us in countenance . Make haste , my dear creature , and come to us . John is just walked off , but he will be back in a moment . \u201d Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer . The others walked away , John Thorpe was still in view , and she gave herself up for lost . That she might not appear , however , to observe or expect him , she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan ; and a self - condemnation for her folly , in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time , had just passed through her mind , when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance , by Mr. Tilney himself . With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request , and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set , may be easily imagined . To escape , and , as she believed , so narrowly escape John Thorpe , and to be asked , so immediately on his joining her , asked by Mr. Tilney , as if he had sought her on purpose!\u2014it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity . Scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place , however , when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe , who stood behind her . \u201c Heyday , Miss Morland ! \u201d said he . \u201c What is the meaning of this ? I thought you and I were to dance together . \u201d \u201c I wonder you should think so , for you never asked me . \u201d \u201c That is a good one , by Jove ! i asked you as soon as I came into the room , and I was just going to ask you again , but when I turned round , you were gone ! this is a cursed shabby trick ! i only came for the sake of dancing with _ you _ , and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday . Yes ; I remember , I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak . And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room ; and when they see you standing up with somebody else , they will quiz me famously . \u201d \u201c Oh , no ; they will never think of _ me _ , after such a description as that . \u201d \u201c By heavens , if they do not , I will kick them out of the room for blockheads . What chap have you there ? \u201d Catherine satisfied his curiosity . \u201c Tilney , \u201d he repeated . \u201c Hum \u2014 I do not know him . A good figure of a man ; well put together . Does he want a horse ? Here is a friend of mine , Sam Fletcher , has got one to sell that would suit anybody . A famous clever animal for the road \u2014 only forty guineas . I had fifty minds to buy it myself , for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one ; but it would not answer my purpose , it would not do for the field . I would give any money for a real good hunter . I have three now , the best that ever were backed . I would not take eight hundred guineas for them . Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire , against the next season . It is so d \u2014 \u2014 uncomfortable , living at an inn . \u201d This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine \u2019s attention , for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies . Her partner now drew near , and said , \u201c That gentleman would have put me out of patience , had he stayed with you half a minute longer . He has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me . We have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening , and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time . Nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one , without injuring the rights of the other . I consider a country - dance as an emblem of marriage . Fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both ; and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves , have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours . \u201d \u201c But they are such very different things ! \u201d \u201c \u2014 That you think they can not be compared together . \u201d \u201c To be sure not . People that marry can never part , but must go and keep house together . People that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour . \u201d \u201c And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing . Taken in that light certainly , their resemblance is not striking ; but I think I could place them in such a view . You will allow , that in both , man has the advantage of choice , woman only the power of refusal ; that in both , it is an engagement between man and woman , formed for the advantage of each ; and that when once entered into , they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution ; that it is their duty , each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere , and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours , or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else . You will allow all this ? \u201d \u201c Yes , to be sure , as you state it , all this sounds very well ; but still they are so very different . I can not look upon them at all in the same light , nor think the same duties belong to them . \u201d \u201c In one respect , there certainly is a difference . In marriage , the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman , the woman to make the home agreeable to the man ; he is to purvey , and she is to smile . But in dancing , their duties are exactly changed ; the agreeableness , the compliance are expected from him , while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water . _ That _ , I suppose , was the difference of duties which struck you , as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison . \u201d \u201c No , indeed , I never thought of that . \u201d \u201c Then I am quite at a loss . One thing , however , I must observe . This disposition on your side is rather alarming . You totally disallow any similarity in the obligations ; and may I not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish ? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return , or if any other gentleman were to address you , there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose ? \u201d \u201c Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother \u2019s , that if he talks to me , I must talk to him again ; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with . \u201d \u201c And is that to be my only security ? Alas , alas ! \u201d \u201c Nay , I am sure you can not have a better ; for if I do not know anybody , it is impossible for me to talk to them ; and , besides , I do not _ want _ to talk to anybody . \u201d \u201c Now you have given me a security worth having ; and I shall proceed with courage . Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry before ? \u201d \u201c Yes , quite \u2014 more so , indeed . \u201d \u201c More so ! take care , or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time . You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks . \u201d \u201c I do not think I should be tired , if I were to stay here six months . \u201d \u201c Bath , compared with London , has little variety , and so everybody finds out every year . \u2018 For six weeks , I allow Bath is pleasant enough ; but beyond _ that _ , it is the most tiresome place in the world . \u2019 You would be told so by people of all descriptions , who come regularly every winter , lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve , and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer . \u201d \u201c Well , other people must judge for themselves , and those who go to London may think nothing of Bath . But I , who live in a small retired village in the country , can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home ; for here are a variety of amusements , a variety of things to be seen and done all day long , which I can know nothing of there . \u201d \u201c You are not fond of the country . \u201d \u201c Yes , I am . I have always lived there , and always been very happy . But certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath life . One day in the country is exactly like another . \u201d \u201c But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country . \u201d \u201c Do I ? \u201d \u201c Do you not ? \u201d \u201c I do not believe there is much difference . \u201d \u201c Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long . \u201d \u201c And so I am at home \u2014 only I do not find so much of it . I walk about here , and so I do there ; but here I see a variety of people in every street , and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen . \u201d Mr. Tilney was very much amused . \u201c Only go and call on Mrs. Allen ! \u201d he repeated . \u201c What a picture of intellectual poverty ! however , when you sink into this abyss again , you will have more to say . You will be able to talk of Bath , and of all that you did here . \u201d \u201c Oh ! yes . I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs. Allen , or anybody else . I really believe I shall always be talking of Bath , when I am at home again \u2014 I _ do _ like it so very much . If I could but have Papa and Mamma , and the rest of them here , I suppose I should be too happy ! james \u2019s coming ( my eldest brother ) is quite delightful \u2014 and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already . Oh ! who can ever be tired of Bath ? \u201d \u201c Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do . But papas and mammas , and brothers , and intimate friends are a good deal gone by , to most of the frequenters of Bath \u2014 and the honest relish of balls and plays , and everyday sights , is past with them . \u201d Here their conversation closed , the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention . Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set , Catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers - on , immediately behind her partner . He was a very handsome man , of a commanding aspect , past the bloom , but not past the vigour of life ; and with his eye still directed towards her , she saw him presently address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper . Confused by his notice , and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance , she turned away her head . But while she did so , the gentleman retreated , and her partner , coming nearer , said , \u201c I see that you guess what I have just been asked . That gentleman knows your name , and you have a right to know his . It is General Tilney , my father . \u201d Catherine \u2019s answer was only \u201c Oh!\u201d\u2014but it was an \u201c Oh ! \u201d expressing everything needful : attention to his words , and perfect reliance on their truth . With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the General , as he moved through the crowd , and \u201c How handsome a family they are ! \u201d was her secret remark . In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded , a new source of felicity arose to her . She had never taken a country walk since her arrival in Bath . Miss Tilney , to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar , spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too ; and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her , it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk , some morning or other . \u201c I shall like it , \u201d she cried , \u201c beyond anything in the world ; and do not let us put it off \u2014 let us go to - morrow . \u201d This was readily agreed to , with only a proviso of Miss Tilney \u2019s , that it did not rain , which Catherine was sure it would not . At twelve o\u2019clock , they were to call for her in Pulteney Street ; and \u201c Remember \u2014 twelve o\u2019clock , \u201d was her parting speech to her new friend . Of her other , her older , her more established friend , Isabella , of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight \u2019s experience , she scarcely saw anything during the evening . Yet , though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness , she cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen , which took them rather early away , and her spirits danced within her , as she danced in her chair all the way home . 11 The morrow brought a very sober - looking morning , the sun making only a few efforts to appear , and Catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes . A bright morning so early in the year , she allowed , would generally turn to rain , but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced . She applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of her hopes , but Mr. Allen , not having his own skies and barometer about him , declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine . She applied to Mrs. Allen , and Mrs. Allen \u2019s opinion was more positive . \u201c She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day , if the clouds would only go off , and the sun keep out . \u201d At about eleven o\u2019clock , however , a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine \u2019s watchful eye , and \u201c Oh ! dear , I do believe it will be wet , \u201d broke from her in a most desponding tone . \u201c I thought how it would be , \u201d said Mrs. Allen . \u201c No walk for me to - day , \u201d sighed Catherine ; \u201c but perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . \u201d \u201c Perhaps it may , but then , my dear , it will be so dirty . \u201d \u201c Oh ! that will not signify ; I never mind dirt . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d replied her friend very placidly , \u201c I know you never mind dirt . \u201d After a short pause , \u201c It comes on faster and faster ! \u201d said Catherine , as she stood watching at a window . \u201c So it does indeed . If it keeps raining , the streets will be very wet . \u201d \u201c There are four umbrellas up already . How I hate the sight of an umbrella ! \u201d \u201c They are disagreeable things to carry . I would much rather take a chair at any time . \u201d \u201c It was such a nice - looking morning ! i felt so convinced it would be dry ! \u201d \u201c Anybody would have thought so indeed . There will be very few people in the pump - room , if it rains all the morning . I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable . \u201d The rain continued \u2014 fast , though not heavy . Catherine went every five minutes to the clock , threatening on each return that , if it still kept on raining another five minutes , she would give up the matter as hopeless . The clock struck twelve , and it still rained . \u201c You will not be able to go , my dear . \u201d \u201c I do not quite despair yet . I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve . This is just the time of day for it to clear up , and I do think it looks a little lighter . There , it is twenty minutes after twelve , and now I _ shall _ give it up entirely . Oh ! that we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho , or at least in Tuscany and the south of France!\u2014the night that poor St. Aubin died!\u2014such beautiful weather ! \u201d At half past twelve , when Catherine \u2019s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment , the sky began voluntarily to clear . A gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise ; she looked round ; the clouds were parting , and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance . Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed , and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen , who had \u201c always thought it would clear up . \u201d But whether Catherine might still expect her friends , whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture , must yet be a question . It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump - room ; he accordingly set off by himself , and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages , containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back . \u201c Isabella , my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare ! they are coming for me perhaps \u2014 but I shall not go \u2014 I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . \u201d Mrs. Allen agreed to it . John Thorpe was soon with them , and his voice was with them yet sooner , for on the stairs he was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick . \u201c Make haste ! make haste ! \u201d as he threw open the door . \u201c Put on your hat this moment \u2014 there is no time to be lost \u2014 we are going to Bristol . How d\u2019ye do , Mrs. Allen ? \u201d \u201c To Bristol ! is not that a great way off ? But , however , I can not go with you to - day , because I am engaged ; I expect some friends every moment . \u201d This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all ; Mrs. Allen was called on to second him , and the two others walked in , to give their assistance . \u201c My sweetest Catherine , is not this delightful ? We shall have a most heavenly drive . You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme ; it darted into our heads at breakfast - time , I verily believe at the same instant ; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain . But it does not signify , the nights are moonlight , and we shall do delightfully . Oh ! i am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet ! so much better than going to the Lower Rooms . We shall drive directly to Clifton and dine there ; and , as soon as dinner is over , if there is time for it , go on to Kingsweston . \u201d \u201c I doubt our being able to do so much , \u201d said Morland . \u201c You croaking fellow ! \u201d cried Thorpe . \u201c We shall be able to do ten times more . Kingsweston ! aye , and Blaize Castle too , and anything else we can hear of ; but here is your sister says she will not go . \u201d \u201c Blaize Castle ! \u201d cried Catherine . \u201c What is that ? \u201d \u201c The finest place in England \u2014 worth going fifty miles at any time to see . \u201d \u201c What , is it really a castle , an old castle ? \u201d \u201c The oldest in the kingdom . \u201d \u201c But is it like what one reads of ? \u201d \u201c Exactly \u2014 the very same . \u201d \u201c But now really \u2014 are there towers and long galleries ? \u201d \u201c By dozens . \u201d \u201c Then I should like to see it ; but I cannot \u2014 I can not go . \u201d \u201c Not go ! my beloved creature , what do you mean ? \u201d \u201c I can not go , because\u201d\u2014looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella \u2019s smile\u2014\u201cI expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk . They promised to come at twelve , only it rained ; but now , as it is so fine , I dare say they will be here soon . \u201d \u201c Not they indeed , \u201d cried Thorpe ; \u201c for , as we turned into Broad Street , I saw them \u2014 does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts ? \u201d \u201c I do not know indeed . \u201d \u201c Yes , I know he does ; I saw him . You are talking of the man you danced with last night , are not you ? \u201d \u201c Yes . \u201d \u201c Well , I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road , driving a smart - looking girl . \u201d \u201c Did you indeed ? \u201d \u201c Did upon my soul ; knew him again directly , and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too . \u201d \u201c It is very odd ! but I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk . \u201d \u201c And well they might , for I never saw so much dirt in my life . Walk ! You could no more walk than you could fly ! it has not been so dirty the whole winter ; it is ankle - deep everywhere . \u201d Isabella corroborated it : \u201c My dearest Catherine , you can not form an idea of the dirt ; come , you must go ; you can not refuse going now . \u201d \u201c I should like to see the castle ; but may we go all over it ? May we go up every staircase , and into every suite of rooms ? \u201d \u201c Yes , yes , every hole and corner . \u201d \u201c But then , if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer , and call by and by ? \u201d \u201c Make yourself easy , there is no danger of that , for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback , that they were going as far as Wick Rocks . \u201d \u201c Then I will . Shall I go , Mrs. Allen ? \u201d \u201c Just as you please , my dear . \u201d \u201c Mrs. Allen , you must persuade her to go , \u201d was the general cry . Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it : \u201c Well , my dear , \u201d said she , \u201c suppose you go . \u201d And in two minutes they were off . Catherine \u2019s feelings , as she got into the carriage , were in a very unsettled state ; divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure , and the hope of soon enjoying another , almost its equal in degree , however unlike in kind . She could not think the Tilneys had acted quite well by her , in so readily giving up their engagement , without sending her any message of excuse . It was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk ; and , in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour , she could not from her own observation help thinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience . To feel herself slighted by them was very painful . On the other hand , the delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho , as her fancy represented Blaize Castle to be , was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost anything . They passed briskly down Pulteney Street , and through Laura Place , without the exchange of many words . Thorpe talked to his horse , and she meditated , by turns , on broken promises and broken arches , phaetons and false hangings , Tilneys and trap - doors . As they entered Argyle Buildings , however , she was roused by this address from her companion , \u201c Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by ? \u201d \u201c Who ? Where ? \u201d \u201c On the right - hand pavement \u2014 she must be almost out of sight now . \u201d Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother \u2019s arm , walking slowly down the street . She saw them both looking back at her . \u201c Stop , stop , Mr. Thorpe , \u201d she impatiently cried ; \u201c it is Miss Tilney ; it is indeed . How could you tell me they were gone ? Stop , stop , I will get out this moment and go to them . \u201d But to what purpose did she speak ? Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot ; the Tilneys , who had soon ceased to look after her , were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place , and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace . Still , however , and during the length of another street , she entreated him to stop . \u201c Pray , pray stop , Mr. Thorpe . I can not go on . I will not go on . I must go back to Miss Tilney . \u201d But Mr. Thorpe only laughed , smacked his whip , encouraged his horse , made odd noises , and drove on ; and Catherine , angry and vexed as she was , having no power of getting away , was obliged to give up the point and submit . Her reproaches , however , were not spared . \u201c How could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road ? I would not have had it happen so for the world . They must think it so strange , so rude of me ! to go by them , too , without saying a word ! you do not know how vexed I am ; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton , nor in anything else . I had rather , ten thousand times rather , get out now , and walk back to them . How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton ? \u201d Thorpe defended himself very stoutly , declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life , and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself . Their drive , even when this subject was over , was not likely to be very agreeable . Catherine \u2019s complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing . She listened reluctantly , and her replies were short . Blaize Castle remained her only comfort ; towards _ that _ , she still looked at intervals with pleasure ; though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk , and especially rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys , she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its walls could supply \u2014 the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms , exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture , though now for many years deserted \u2014 the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow , winding vaults , by a low , grated door ; or even of having their lamp , their only lamp , extinguished by a sudden gust of wind , and of being left in total darkness . In the meanwhile , they proceeded on their journey without any mischance , and were within view of the town of Keynsham , when a halloo from Morland , who was behind them , made his friend pull up , to know what was the matter . The others then came close enough for conversation , and Morland said , \u201c We had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on to - day ; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street , very little more than seven miles ; and , I suppose , we have at least eight more to go . It will never do . We set out a great deal too late . We had much better put it off till another day , and turn round . \u201d \u201c It is all one to me , \u201d replied Thorpe rather angrily ; and instantly turning his horse , they were on their way back to Bath . \u201c If your brother had not got such a d \u2014 \u2014 beast to drive , \u201d said he soon afterwards , \u201c we might have done it very well . My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour , if left to himself , and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken - winded jade \u2019s pace . Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own . \u201d \u201c No , he is not , \u201d said Catherine warmly , \u201c for I am sure he could not afford it . \u201d \u201c And why can not he afford it ? \u201d \u201c Because he has not money enough . \u201d \u201c And whose fault is that ? \u201d \u201c Nobody \u2019s , that I know of . \u201d Thorpe then said something in the loud , incoherent way to which he had often recourse , about its being a d \u2014 \u2014 thing to be miserly ; and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things , he did not know who could , which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand . Disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment , she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so ; and they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words . As she entered the house , the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off ; that , when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe , the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her ; and on his saying no , had felt for a card , but said she had none about her , and went away . Pondering over these heart - rending tidings , Catherine walked slowly upstairs . At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , \u201c I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . It was a strange , wild scheme . \u201d They all spent the evening together at Thorpe \u2019s . Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits ; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce , in the fate of which she shared , by private partnership with Morland , a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton . Her satisfaction , too , in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once . \u201c How I pity the poor creatures that are going there ! how glad I am that I am not amongst them ! i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not ! they have not begun dancing yet . I would not be there for all the world . It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself . I dare say it will not be a very good ball . I know the Mitchells will not be there . I am sure I pity everybody that is . But I dare say , Mr. Morland , you long to be at it , do not you ? I am sure you do . Well , pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you . I dare say we could do very well without you ; but you men think yourselves of such consequence . \u201d Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows , so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind , and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered . \u201c Do not be so dull , my dearest creature , \u201d she whispered . \u201c You will quite break my heart . It was amazingly shocking , to be sure ; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame . Why were not they more punctual ? It was dirty , indeed , but what did that signify ? I am sure John and I should not have minded it . I never mind going through anything , where a friend is concerned ; that is my disposition , and John is just the same ; he has amazing strong feelings . Good heavens ! what a delightful hand you have got ! kings , I vow ! i never was so happy in my life ! i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself . \u201d And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch , which is the true heroine \u2019s portion ; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears . And lucky may she think herself , if she get another good night \u2019s rest in the course of the next three months .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [32, 34], "text": "the latter"},
