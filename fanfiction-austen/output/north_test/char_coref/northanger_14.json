{"document": "28 Soon after this , the General found himself obliged to go to London for a week ; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland \u2019s company , and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence . His departure gave Catherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain . The happiness with which their time now passed , every employment voluntary , every laugh indulged , every meal a scene of ease and good humour , walking where they liked and when they liked , their hours , pleasures , and fatigues at their own command , made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the General \u2019s presence had imposed , and most thankfully feel their present release from it . Such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day ; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one , and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other , she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy ; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit ; before the General came home , the fourth week would be turned , and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer . This was a painful consideration whenever it occurred ; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind , she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once , propose going away , and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken . Aware that if she gave herself much time , she might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject , she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone with Eleanor , and of Eleanor \u2019s being in the middle of a speech about something very different , to start forth her obligation of going away very soon . Eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned . She had \u201c hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time \u2014 had been misled ( perhaps by her wishes ) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised \u2014 and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there , they would be too generous to hasten her return . \u201d Catherine explained : \u201c Oh ! as to _ that _ , Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all . As long as she was happy , they would always be satisfied . \u201d \u201c Then why , might she ask , in such a hurry herself to leave them ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! because she had been there so long . \u201d \u201c Nay , if you can use such a word , I can urge you no farther . If you think it long \u2014 \u201d \u201c Oh ! no , I do not indeed . For my own pleasure , I could stay with you as long again . \u201d And it was directly settled that , till she had , her leaving them was not even to be thought of . In having this cause of uneasiness so pleasantly removed , the force of the other was likewise weakened . The kindness , the earnestness of Eleanor \u2019s manner in pressing her to stay , and Henry \u2019s gratified look on being told that her stay was determined , were such sweet proofs of her importance with them , as left her only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without . She did \u2014 almost always \u2014 believe that Henry loved her , and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them ; and believing so far , her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations . Henry was not able to obey his father \u2019s injunction of remaining wholly at Northanger in attendance on the ladies , during his absence in London , the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on Saturday for a couple of nights . His loss was not now what it had been while the General was at home ; it lessened their gaiety , but did not ruin their comfort ; and the two girls agreeing in occupation , and improving in intimacy , found themselves so well sufficient for the time to themselves , that it was eleven o\u2019clock , rather a late hour at the abbey , before they quitted the supper - room on the day of Henry \u2019s departure . They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed , as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge , that a carriage was driving up to the door , and the next moment confirmed the idea by the loud noise of the house - bell . After the first perturbation of surprise had passed away , in a \u201c Good heaven ! what can be the matter ? \u201d it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother , whose arrival was often as sudden , if not quite so unseasonable , and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him . Catherine walked on to her chamber , making up her mind as well as she could , to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney , and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her , and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her , that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful . She trusted he would never speak of Miss Thorpe ; and indeed , as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted , there could be no danger of it ; and as long as all mention of Bath scenes were avoided , she thought she could behave to him very civilly . In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent . Scarcely , however , had she convicted her fancy of error , when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start ; it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway \u2014 and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it . She trembled a little at the idea of anyone \u2019s approaching so cautiously ; but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm , or misled by a raised imagination , she stepped quietly forward , and opened the door . Eleanor , and only Eleanor , stood there . Catherine \u2019s spirits , however , were tranquillized but for an instant , for Eleanor \u2019s cheeks were pale , and her manner greatly agitated . Though evidently intending to come in , it seemed an effort to enter the room , and a still greater to speak when there . Catherine , supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney \u2019s account , could only express her concern by silent attention , obliged her to be seated , rubbed her temples with lavender water , and hung over her with affectionate solicitude . \u201c My dear Catherine , you must not \u2014 you must not indeed \u2014 \u201d were Eleanor \u2019s first connected words . \u201c I am quite well . This kindness distracts me \u2014 I can not bear it \u2014 I come to you on such an errand ! \u201d \u201c Errand ! to me ! \u201d \u201c How shall I tell you ! oh ! how shall I tell you ! \u201d A new idea now darted into Catherine \u2019s mind , and turning as pale as her friend , she exclaimed , \u201c \u2019 Tis a messenger from Woodston ! \u201d \u201c You are mistaken , indeed , \u201d returned Eleanor , looking at her most compassionately ; \u201c it is no one from Woodston . It is my father himself . \u201d Her voice faltered , and her eyes were turned to the ground as she mentioned his name . His unlooked - for return was enough in itself to make Catherine \u2019s heart sink , and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told . She said nothing ; and Eleanor , endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness , but with eyes still cast down , soon went on . \u201c You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform . I am indeed a most unwilling messenger . After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us \u2014 how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!\u2014as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted \u2014 and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by \u2014 But I must not trust myself with words . My dear Catherine , we are to part . My father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on Monday . We are going to Lord Longtown \u2019s , near Hereford , for a fortnight . Explanation and apology are equally impossible . I can not attempt either . \u201d \u201c My dear Eleanor , \u201d cried Catherine , suppressing her feelings as well as she could , \u201c do not be so distressed . A second engagement must give way to a first . I am very , very sorry we are to part \u2014 so soon , and so suddenly too ; but I am not offended , indeed I am not . I can finish my visit here , you know , at any time ; or I hope you will come to me . Can you , when you return from this lord \u2019s , come to Fullerton ? \u201d \u201c It will not be in my power , Catherine . \u201d \u201c Come when you can , then . \u201d Eleanor made no answer ; and Catherine \u2019s thoughts recurring to something more directly interesting , she added , thinking aloud , \u201c Monday \u2014 so soon as Monday ; and you _ all _ go . Well , I am certain of \u2014 I shall be able to take leave , however . I need not go till just before you do , you know . Do not be distressed , Eleanor , I can go on Monday very well . My father and mother \u2019s having no notice of it is of very little consequence . The General will send a servant with me , I dare say , half the way \u2014 and then I shall soon be at Salisbury , and then I am only nine miles from home . \u201d \u201c Ah , Catherine ! were it settled so , it would be somewhat less intolerable , though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought . But \u2014 how can I tell you?\u2014to - morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o\u2019clock , and no servant will be offered you . \u201d Catherine sat down , breathless and speechless . \u201c I could hardly believe my senses , when I heard it ; and no displeasure , no resentment that you can feel at this moment , however justly great , can be more than I myself \u2014 but I must not talk of what I felt . Oh ! that I could suggest anything in extenuation ! good God ! what will your father and mother say ! after courting you from the protection of real friends to this \u2014 almost double distance from your home , to have you driven out of the house , without the considerations even of decent civility ! dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . \u201d \u201c Have I offended the General ? \u201d said Catherine in a faltering voice . \u201c Alas ! for my feelings as a daughter , all that I know , all that I answer for , is that you can have given him no just cause of offence . He certainly is greatly , very greatly discomposed ; I have seldom seen him more so . His temper is not happy , and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree ; some disappointment , some vexation , which just at this moment seems important , but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in , for how is it possible ? \u201d It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all ; and it was only for Eleanor \u2019s sake that she attempted it . \u201c I am sure , \u201d said she , \u201c I am very sorry if I have offended him . It was the last thing I would willingly have done . But do not be unhappy , Eleanor . An engagement , you know , must be kept . I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner , that I might have written home . But it is of very little consequence . \u201d \u201c I hope , I earnestly hope , that to your real safety it will be of none ; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence : to comfort , appearance , propriety , to your family , to the world . Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! \u201d \u201c Oh , the journey is nothing . Do not think about that . And if we are to part , a few hours sooner or later , you know , makes no difference . I can be ready by seven . Let me be called in time . \u201d Eleanor saw that she wished to be alone ; and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation , now left her with , \u201c I shall see you in the morning . \u201d Catherine \u2019s swelling heart needed relief . In Eleanor \u2019s presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears , but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrents . Turned from the house , and in such a way ! without any reason that could justify , any apology that could atone for the abruptness , the rudeness , nay , the insolence of it . Henry at a distance \u2014 not able even to bid him farewell . Every hope , every expectation from him suspended , at least , and who could say how long ? Who could say when they might meet again ? And all this by such a man as General Tilney , so polite , so well bred , and heretofore so particularly fond of her ! it was as incomprehensible as it was mortifying and grievous . From what it could arise , and where it would end , were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm . The manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil , hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience , or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling ; of two days , the earliest fixed on , and of that almost the earliest hour , as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning , that he might not be obliged even to see her . What could all this mean but an intentional affront ? By some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offend him . Eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion , but Catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected , or , at least , not supposed to be connected with it . Heavily passed the night . Sleep , or repose that deserved the name of sleep , was out of the question . That room , in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival , was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers . Yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then \u2014 how mournfully superior in reality and substance ! her anxiety had foundation in fact , her fears in probability ; and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil , the solitude of her situation , the darkness of her chamber , the antiquity of the building , were felt and considered without the smallest emotion ; and though the wind was high , and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house , she heard it all as she lay awake , hour after hour , without curiosity or terror . Soon after six Eleanor entered her room , eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible ; but very little remained to be done . Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared . What so natural , as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it ? And she only wanted to know how far , after what had passed , an apology might properly be received by her . But the knowledge would have been useless here ; it was not called for ; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial \u2014 Eleanor brought no message . Very little passed between them on meeting ; each found her greatest safety in silence , and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs , Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress , and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk . When everything was done they left the room , Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well - known , cherished object , and went down to the breakfast - parlour , where breakfast was prepared . She tried to eat , as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable ; but she had no appetite , and could not swallow many mouthfuls . The contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery , and strengthened her distaste for everything before her . It was not four and twenty hours ago since they had met there to the same repast , but in circumstances how different ! with what cheerful ease , what happy , though false , security , had she then looked around her , enjoying everything present , and fearing little in future , beyond Henry \u2019s going to Woodston for a day ! happy , happy breakfast ! for Henry had been there ; Henry had sat by her and helped her . These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion , who sat as deep in thought as herself ; and the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the present moment . Catherine \u2019s colour rose at the sight of it ; and the indignity with which she was treated , striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force , made her for a short time sensible only of resentment . Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech . \u201c You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , \u201d she cried ; \u201c you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible . Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour \u2019s comfort . For _ one _ letter , at all risks , all hazards , I must entreat . Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more . Direct to me at Lord Longtown \u2019s , and , I must ask it , under cover to Alice . \u201d \u201c No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write . There can be no doubt of my getting home safe . \u201d Eleanor only replied , \u201c I can not wonder at your feelings . I will not importune you . I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . \u201d But this , with the look of sorrow accompanying it , was enough to melt Catherine \u2019s pride in a moment , and she instantly said , \u201c Oh , Eleanor , I _ will _ write to you indeed . \u201d There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle , though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of . It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home , Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey , and , upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation , it proved to be exactly the case . Catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment , but , upon examining her purse , was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend , she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home ; and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both , scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together . Short , however , was that time . The carriage was soon announced to be ready ; and Catherine , instantly rising , a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu ; and , as they entered the hall , unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either , she paused a moment , and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left \u201c her kind remembrance for her absent friend . \u201d But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings ; and , hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief , she darted across the hall , jumped into the chaise , and in a moment was driven from the door . 29 Catherine was too wretched to be fearful . The journey in itself had no terrors for her ; and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness . Leaning back in one corner of the carriage , in a violent burst of tears , she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head ; and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it . Unfortunately , the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from Woodston ; and , for fourteen miles , every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different . Every mile , as it brought her nearer Woodston , added to her sufferings , and when within the distance of five , she passed the turning which led to it , and thought of Henry , so near , yet so unconscious , her grief and agitation were excessive . The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life . It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage . Yes , only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard \u2014 had he even confused her by his too significant reference ! and now \u2014 what had she done , or what had she omitted to do , to merit such a change ? The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge . Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained ; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each . Designedly , at least , Henry could not have betrayed her . If , indeed , by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for , of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations , she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation . If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer , she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house . But a justification so full of torture to herself , she trusted , would not be in his power . Anxious as were all her conjectures on this point , it was not , however , the one on which she dwelt most . There was a thought yet nearer , a more prevailing , more impetuous concern . How Henry would think , and feel , and look , when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her being gone , was a question of force and interest to rise over every other , to be never ceasing , alternately irritating and soothing ; it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence , and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment . To the General , of course , he would not dare to speak ; but to Eleanor \u2014 what might he not say to Eleanor about her ? In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries , on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose , the hours passed away , and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for . The pressing anxieties of thought , which prevented her from noticing anything before her , when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston , saved her at the same time from watching her progress ; and though no object on the road could engage a moment \u2019s attention , she found no stage of it tedious . From this , she was preserved too by another cause , by feeling no eagerness for her journey \u2019s conclusion ; for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best , even after an absence such as hers \u2014 an eleven weeks \u2019 absence . What had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family , that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it , extend an useless resentment , and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will ? She could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor \u2019s merit ; she felt it too strongly for expression ; and should a dislike be taken against them , should they be thought of unfavourably , on their father \u2019s account , it would cut her to the heart . With these feelings , she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well - known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home . Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger ; but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post - masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it ; so great had been her ignorance of her route . She met with nothing , however , to distress or frighten her . Her youth , civil manners , and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require ; and stopping only to change horses , she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm , and between six and seven o\u2019clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton . A heroine returning , at the close of her career , to her native village , in all the triumph of recovered reputation , and all the dignity of a countess , with a long train of noble relations in their several phaetons , and three waiting - maids in a travelling chaise and four , behind her , is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well delight to dwell ; it gives credit to every conclusion , and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestows . But my affair is widely different ; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and disgrace ; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness . A heroine in a hack post - chaise is such a blow upon sentiment , as no attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand . Swiftly therefore shall her post - boy drive through the village , amid the gaze of Sunday groups , and speedy shall be her descent from it . But , whatever might be the distress of Catherine \u2019s mind , as she thus advanced towards the parsonage , and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it , she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went ; first , in the appearance of her carriage \u2014 and secondly , in herself . The chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in Fullerton , the whole family were immediately at the window ; and to have it stop at the sweep - gate was a pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy \u2014 a pleasure quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children , a boy and girl of six and four years old , who expected a brother or sister in every carriage . Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine ! happy the voice that proclaimed the discovery ! but whether such happiness were the lawful property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood . Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine \u2019s heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible . So surrounded , so caressed , she was even happy ! in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued , and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity , they were all seated round the tea - table , which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller , whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice , before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her . Reluctantly , and with much hesitation , did she then begin what might perhaps , at the end of half an hour , be termed , by the courtesy of her hearers , an explanation ; but scarcely , within that time , could they at all discover the cause , or collect the particulars , of her sudden return . They were far from being an irritable race ; far from any quickness in catching , or bitterness in resenting , affronts : but here , when the whole was unfolded , was an insult not to be overlooked , nor , for the first half hour , to be easily pardoned . Without suffering any romantic alarm , in the consideration of their daughter \u2019s long and lonely journey , Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her ; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered ; and that , in forcing her on such a measure , General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly \u2014 neither as a gentleman nor as a parent . Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that \u201c it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , \u201d grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour . \u201c My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , \u201d said her mother at last ; \u201c depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . \u201d \u201c I can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , \u201d said Sarah , \u201c but why not do it civilly ? \u201d \u201c I am sorry for the young people , \u201d returned Mrs. Morland ; \u201c they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General Tilney . \u201d Catherine sighed . \u201c Well , \u201d continued her philosophic mother , \u201c I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done . It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets . \u201d Catherine hoped so too , and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment , but her spirits were quite worn down ; and , to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish , she readily agreed to her mother \u2019s next counsel of going early to bed . Her parents , seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings , and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey , parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away ; and though , when they all met the next morning , her recovery was not equal to their hopes , they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil . They never once thought of her heart , which , for the parents of a young lady of seventeen , just returned from her first excursion from home , was odd enough ! As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend \u2019s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure . The strength of these feelings , however , was far from assisting her pen ; and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor Tilney . To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation , convey gratitude without servile regret , be guarded without coldness , and honest without resentment \u2014 a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of \u2014 and , above all , which she might not blush herself , if Henry should chance to see , was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance ; and , after long thought and much perplexity , to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety . The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks , and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart . \u201c This has been a strange acquaintance , \u201d observed Mrs. Morland , as the letter was finished ; \u201c soon made and soon ended . I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella . Ah ! poor James ! well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . \u201d Catherine coloured as she warmly answered , \u201c No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . \u201d \u201c If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy . It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years ; and then what a pleasure it will be ! \u201d Mrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation . The hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into Catherine \u2019s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her . She could never forget Henry Tilney , or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment ; but he might forget her ; and in that case , to meet \u2014 ! her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James \u2019s disappointment . \u201c We are sorry for him , \u201d said she ; \u201c but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ; for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with , and who was so entirely without fortune ; and now , after such behaviour , we can not think at all well of her . Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice . \u201d This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could listen to ; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance , and made her reply less rational ; for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well - known road . It was not three months ago since , wild with joyful expectation , she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day , with an heart light , gay , and independent ; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed , and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it . Three months ago had seen her all this ; and now , how altered a being did she return ! She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked - for appearance , acting on a steady affection , would naturally call forth ; and great was their surprise , and warm their displeasure , on hearing how she had been treated \u2014 though Mrs. Morland \u2019s account of it was no inflated representation , no studied appeal to their passions . \u201c Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , \u201d said she . \u201c She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house . Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again ! and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . \u201d Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself . His wonder , his conjectures , and his explanations became in succession hers , with the addition of this single remark\u2014\u201cI really have not patience with the General\u201d\u2014to fill up every accidental pause . And , \u201c I really have not patience with the General , \u201d was uttered twice after Mr. Allen left the room , without any relaxation of anger , or any material digression of thought . A more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition ; and , after completing the fourth , she immediately added , \u201c Only think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was . I must show it you some day or other . Bath is a nice place , Catherine , after all . I assure you I did not above half like coming away . Mrs. Thorpe \u2019s being there was such a comfort to us , was not it ? You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . \u201d \u201c Yes , but _ that _ did not last long , \u201d said Catherine , her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there . \u201c Very true : we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe , and then we wanted for nothing . My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ? I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since . Do you remember that evening ? \u201d \u201c Do I ! oh ! perfectly . \u201d \u201c It was very agreeable , was not it ? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable . I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure . I remember I had my favourite gown on . \u201d Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to\u2014\u201cI really have not patience with the General ! such an agreeable , worthy man as he seemed to be ! i do not suppose , Mrs. Morland , you ever saw a better - bred man in your life . His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them , Catherine . But no wonder ; Milsom Street , you know . \u201d As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter \u2019s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends . There was a great deal of good sense in all this ; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power ; and Catherine \u2019s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced . It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [5, 7], "text": "the General"}, {"position": [8, 9], "text": "himself"}, {"position": [19, 20], "text": "he"}, {"position": [29, 30], "text":
