{"document": "XXII Fanny \u2019s consequence increased on the departure of her cousins . Becoming , as she then did , the only young woman in the drawing - room , the only occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she had hitherto held so humble a third , it was impossible for her not to be more looked at , more thought of and attended to , than she had ever been before ; and \u201c Where is Fanny ? \u201d became no uncommon question , even without her being wanted for any one \u2019s convenience . Not only at home did her value increase , but at the Parsonage too . In that house , which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr. Norris \u2019s death , she became a welcome , an invited guest , and in the gloom and dirt of a November day , most acceptable to Mary Crawford . Her visits there , beginning by chance , were continued by solicitation . Mrs. Grant , really eager to get any change for her sister , could , by the easiest self - deceit , persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing by Fanny , and giving her the most important opportunities of improvement in pressing her frequent calls . Fanny , having been sent into the village on some errand by her aunt Norris , was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage ; and being descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter under the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their premises , was forced , though not without some modest reluctance on her part , to come in . A civil servant she had withstood ; but when Dr. Grant himself went out with an umbrella , there was nothing to be done but to be very much ashamed , and to get into the house as fast as possible ; and to poor Miss Crawford , who had just been contemplating the dismal rain in a very desponding state of mind , sighing over the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning , and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty - four hours , the sound of a little bustle at the front door , and the sight of Miss Price dripping with wet in the vestibule , was delightful . The value of an event on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her . She was all alive again directly , and among the most active in being useful to Fanny , in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first allow , and providing her with dry clothes ; and Fanny , after being obliged to submit to all this attention , and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses and maids , being also obliged , on returning downstairs , to be fixed in their drawing - room for an hour while the rain continued , the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford , and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing and dinner . The two sisters were so kind to her , and so pleasant , that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way , and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the end of the hour , and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant \u2019s carriage and horses out to take her home , with which she was threatened . As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home , she had nothing to suffer on that score ; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts , she was perfectly aware that none would be felt , and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain , her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram . It was beginning to look brighter , when Fanny , observing a harp in the room , asked some questions about it , which soon led to an acknowledgment of her wishing very much to hear it , and a confession , which could hardly be believed , of her having never yet heard it since its being in Mansfield . To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and natural circumstance . She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since the instrument \u2019s arrival , there had been no reason that she should ; but Miss Crawford , calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject , was concerned at her own neglect ; and \u201c Shall I play to you now ? \u201d and \u201c What will you have ? \u201d were questions immediately following with the readiest good - humour . She played accordingly ; happy to have a new listener , and a listener who seemed so much obliged , so full of wonder at the performance , and who shewed herself not wanting in taste . She played till Fanny \u2019s eyes , straying to the window on the weather \u2019s being evidently fair , spoke what she felt must be done . \u201c Another quarter of an hour , \u201d said Miss Crawford , \u201c and we shall see how it will be . Do not run away the first moment of its holding up . Those clouds look alarming . \u201d \u201c But they are passed over , \u201d said Fanny . \u201c I have been watching them . This weather is all from the south . \u201d \u201c South or north , I know a black cloud when I see it ; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening . And besides , I want to play something more to you \u2014 a very pretty piece \u2014 and your cousin Edmund \u2019s prime favourite . You must stay and hear your cousin \u2019s favourite . \u201d Fanny felt that she must ; and though she had not waited for that sentence to be thinking of Edmund , such a memento made her particularly awake to his idea , and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again , perhaps in the very spot where she sat now , listening with constant delight to the favourite air , played , as it appeared to her , with superior tone and expression ; and though pleased with it herself , and glad to like whatever was liked by him , she was more sincerely impatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before ; and on this being evident , she was so kindly asked to call again , to take them in her walk whenever she could , to come and hear more of the harp , that she felt it necessary to be done , if no objection arose at home . Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between them within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams \u2019 going away \u2014 an intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford \u2019s desire of something new , and which had little reality in Fanny \u2019s feelings . Fanny went to her every two or three days : it seemed a kind of fascination : she could not be easy without going , and yet it was without loving her , without ever thinking like her , without any sense of obligation for being sought after now when nobody else was to be had ; and deriving no higher pleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement , and _ that _ often at the expense of her judgment , when it was raised by pleasantry on people or subjects which she wished to be respected . She went , however , and they sauntered about together many an half - hour in Mrs. Grant \u2019s shrubbery , the weather being unusually mild for the time of year , and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now comparatively unsheltered , remaining there perhaps till , in the midst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny \u2019s on the sweets of so protracted an autumn , they were forced , by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them , to jump up and walk for warmth . \u201c This is pretty , very pretty , \u201d said Fanny , looking around her as they were thus sitting together one day ; \u201c every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty . Three years ago , this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field , never thought of as anything , or capable of becoming anything ; and now it is converted into a walk , and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament ; and perhaps , in another three years , we may be forgetting \u2014 almost forgetting what it was before . How wonderful , how very wonderful the operations of time , and the changes of the human mind ! \u201d And following the latter train of thought , she soon afterwards added : \u201c If any one faculty of our nature may be called _ more _ wonderful than the rest , I do think it is memory . There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers , the failures , the inequalities of memory , than in any other of our intelligences . The memory is sometimes so retentive , so serviceable , so obedient ; at others , so bewildered and so weak ; and at others again , so tyrannic , so beyond control ! We are , to be sure , a miracle every way ; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out . \u201d Miss Crawford , untouched and inattentive , had nothing to say ; and Fanny , perceiving it , brought back her own mind to what she thought must interest . \u201c It may seem impertinent in _ me _ to praise , but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this . There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk ! Not too much attempted ! \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d replied Miss Crawford carelessly , \u201c it does very well for a place of this sort . One does not think of extent _ here _ ; and between ourselves , till I came to Mansfield , I had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery , or anything of the kind . \u201d \u201c I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive ! \u201d said Fanny , in reply . \u201c My uncle \u2019s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own , and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general . The evergreen ! How beautiful , how welcome , how wonderful the evergreen ! When one thinks of it , how astonishing a variety of nature ! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety , but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence . You will think me rhapsodising ; but when I am out of doors , especially when I am sitting out of doors , I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain . One can not fix one \u2019s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy . \u201d \u201c To say the truth , \u201d replied Miss Crawford , \u201c I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV . ; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it . If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home , that I should be spending month after month here , as I have done , I certainly should not have believed them . I have now been here nearly five months ; and , moreover , the quietest five months I ever passed . \u201d \u201c _ Too _ quiet for you , I believe . \u201d \u201c I should have thought so _ theoretically _ myself , but , \u201d and her eyes brightened as she spoke , \u201c take it all and all , I never spent so happy a summer . But then , \u201d with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice , \u201c there is no saying what it may lead to . \u201d Fanny \u2019s heart beat quick , and she felt quite unequal to surmising or soliciting anything more . Miss Crawford , however , with renewed animation , soon went on \u2014 \u201c I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be . I can even suppose it pleasant to spend _ half _ the year in the country , under certain circumstances , very pleasant . An elegant , moderate - sized house in the centre of family connexions ; continual engagements among them ; commanding the first society in the neighbourhood ; looked up to , perhaps , as leading it even more than those of larger fortune , and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ with the person one feels most agreeable in the world . There is nothing frightful in such a picture , is there , Miss Price ? One need not envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _ that _ . \u201d \u201c Envy Mrs. Rushworth ! \u201d was all that Fanny attempted to say . \u201c Come , come , it would be very un - handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth , for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay , brilliant , happy hours . I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year . Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing ; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s wife must be to fill her house , and give the best balls in the country . \u201d Fanny was silent , and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness , till suddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes , she exclaimed , \u201c Ah ! here he is . \u201d It was not Mr. Rushworth , however , but Edmund , who then appeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant . \u201c My sister and Mr. Bertram . I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone , that he may be Mr. Bertram again . There is something in the sound of Mr. _ Edmund _ Bertram so formal , so pitiful , so younger - brother - like , that I detest it . \u201d \u201c How differently we feel ! \u201d cried Fanny . \u201c To me , the sound of _ Mr. _ Bertram is so cold and nothing - meaning , so entirely without warmth or character ! It just stands for a gentleman , and that \u2019s all . But there is nobleness in the name of Edmund . It is a name of heroism and renown ; of kings , princes , and knights ; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections . \u201d \u201c I grant you the name is good in itself , and _ Lord _ Edmund or _ Sir _ Edmund sound delightfully ; but sink it under the chill , the annihilation of a Mr. , and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas . Well , shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year , by being up before they can begin ? \u201d Edmund met them with particular pleasure . It was the first time of his seeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintance which he had been hearing of with great satisfaction . A friendship between two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished : and to the credit of the lover \u2019s understanding , be it stated , that he did not by any means consider Fanny as the only , or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship . \u201c Well , \u201d said Miss Crawford , \u201c and do you not scold us for our imprudence ? What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it , and entreated and supplicated never to do so again ? \u201d \u201c Perhaps I might have scolded , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c if either of you had been sitting down alone ; but while you do wrong together , I can overlook a great deal . \u201d \u201c They can not have been sitting long , \u201d cried Mrs. Grant , \u201c for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window , and then they were walking . \u201d \u201c And really , \u201d added Edmund , \u201c the day is so mild , that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent . Our weather must not always be judged by the calendar . We may sometimes take greater liberties in November than in May . \u201d \u201c Upon my word , \u201d cried Miss Crawford , \u201c you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with ! There is no giving you a moment \u2019s uneasiness . You do not know how much we have been suffering , nor what chills we have felt ! But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on , in any little manoeuvre against common sense , that a woman could be plagued with . I had very little hope of _ him _ from the first ; but you , Mrs. Grant , my sister , my own sister , I think I had a right to alarm you a little . \u201d \u201c Do not flatter yourself , my dearest Mary . You have not the smallest chance of moving me . I have my alarms , but they are quite in a different quarter ; and if I could have altered the weather , you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time \u2014 for here are some of my plants which Robert _ will _ leave out because the nights are so mild , and I know the end of it will be , that we shall have a sudden change of weather , a hard frost setting in all at once , taking everybody ( at least Robert ) by surprise , and I shall lose every one ; and what is worse , cook has just been telling me that the turkey , which I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday , because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day , will not keep beyond to - morrow . These are something like grievances , and make me think the weather most unseasonably close . \u201d \u201c The sweets of housekeeping in a country village ! \u201d said Miss Crawford archly . \u201c Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer . \u201d \u201c My dear child , commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul \u2019s , and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be . But we have no such people in Mansfield . What would you have me do ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! you can do nothing but what you do already : be plagued very often , and never lose your temper . \u201d \u201c Thank you ; but there is no escaping these little vexations , Mary , live where we may ; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you , I dare say I shall find you with yours , in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer , perhaps on their very account . Their remoteness and unpunctuality , or their exorbitant charges and frauds , will be drawing forth bitter lamentations . \u201d \u201c I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort . A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of . It certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it . \u201d \u201c You intend to be very rich ? \u201d said Edmund , with a look which , to Fanny \u2019s eye , had a great deal of serious meaning . \u201c To be sure . Do not you ? Do not we all ? \u201d \u201c I can not intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command . Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth . She has only to fix on her number of thousands a year , and there can be no doubt of their coming . My intentions are only not to be poor . \u201d \u201c By moderation and economy , and bringing down your wants to your income , and all that . I understand you \u2014 and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life , with such limited means and indifferent connexions . What can _ you _ want but a decent maintenance ? You have not much time before you ; and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you , or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence . Be honest and poor , by all means \u2014 but I shall not envy you ; I do not much think I shall even respect you . I have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich . \u201d \u201c Your degree of respect for honesty , rich or poor , is precisely what I have no manner of concern with . I do not mean to be poor . Poverty is exactly what I have determined against . Honesty , in the something between , in the middle state of worldly circumstances , is all that I am anxious for your not looking down on . \u201d \u201c But I do look down upon it , if it might have been higher . I must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction . \u201d \u201c But how may it rise ? How may my honesty at least rise to any distinction ? \u201d This was not so very easy a question to answer , and occasioned an \u201c Oh ! \u201d of some length from the fair lady before she could add , \u201c You ought to be in parliament , or you should have gone into the army ten years ago . \u201d \u201c _ That _ is not much to the purpose now ; and as to my being in parliament , I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on . No , Miss Crawford , \u201d he added , in a more serious tone , \u201c there _ are _ distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance \u2014 absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining \u2014 but they are of a different character . \u201d A look of consciousness as he spoke , and what seemed a consciousness of manner on Miss Crawford \u2019s side as she made some laughing answer , was sorrowfull food for Fanny \u2019s observation ; and finding herself quite unable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant , by whose side she was now following the others , she had nearly resolved on going home immediately , and only waited for courage to say so , when the sound of the great clock at Mansfield Park , striking three , made her feel that she had really been much longer absent than usual , and brought the previous self - inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just then , and how , to a very speedy issue . With undoubting decision she directly began her adieus ; and Edmund began at the same time to recollect that his mother had been inquiring for her , and that he had walked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her back . Fanny \u2019s hurry increased ; and without in the least expecting Edmund \u2019s attendance , she would have hastened away alone ; but the general pace was quickened , and they all accompanied her into the house , through which it was necessary to pass . Dr. Grant was in the vestibule , and as they stopt to speak to him she found , from Edmund \u2019s manner , that he _ did _ mean to go with her . He too was taking leave . She could not but be thankful . In the moment of parting , Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his mutton with him the next day ; and Fanny had barely time for an unpleasant feeling on the occasion , when Mrs. Grant , with sudden recollection , turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company too . This was so new an attention , so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of Fanny \u2019s life , that she was all surprise and embarrassment ; and while stammering out her great obligation , and her \u201c but she did not suppose it would be in her power , \u201d was looking at Edmund for his opinion and help . But Edmund , delighted with her having such an happiness offered , and ascertaining with half a look , and half a sentence , that she had no objection but on her aunt \u2019s account , could not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing her , and therefore gave his decided open advice that the invitation should be accepted ; and though Fanny would not venture , even on his encouragement , to such a flight of audacious independence , it was soon settled , that if nothing were heard to the contrary , Mrs. Grant might expect her . \u201c And you know what your dinner will be , \u201d said Mrs. Grant , smiling\u2014\u201cthe turkey , and I assure you a very fine one ; for , my dear , \u201d turning to her husband , \u201c cook insists upon the turkey \u2019s being dressed to - morrow . \u201d \u201c Very well , very well , \u201d cried Dr. Grant , \u201c all the better ; I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house . But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram , I dare say , would take their chance . We none of us want to hear the bill of fare . A friendly meeting , and not a fine dinner , is all we have in view . A turkey , or a goose , or a leg of mutton , or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us . \u201d The two cousins walked home together ; and , except in the immediate discussion of this engagement , which Edmund spoke of with the warmest satisfaction , as so particularly desirable for her in the intimacy which he saw with so much pleasure established , it was a silent walk ; for having finished that subject , he grew thoughtful and indisposed for any other . XXIII \u201c But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny ? \u201d said Lady Bertram . \u201c How came she to think of asking Fanny ? Fanny never dines there , you know , in this sort of way . I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go . Fanny , you do not want to go , do you ? \u201d \u201c If you put such a question to her , \u201d cried Edmund , preventing his cousin \u2019s speaking , \u201c Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure , my dear mother , she would like to go ; and I can see no reason why she should not . \u201d \u201c I can not imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her ? She never did before . She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny . \u201d \u201c If you can not do without me , ma\u2019am \u2014 \u201d said Fanny , in a self - denying tone . \u201c But my mother will have my father with her all the evening . \u201d \u201c To be sure , so I shall . \u201d \u201c Suppose you take my father \u2019s opinion , ma\u2019am . \u201d \u201c That \u2019s well thought of . So I will , Edmund . I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . \u201d \u201c As you please , ma\u2019am , on that head ; but I meant my father \u2019s opinion as to the _ propriety _ of the invitation \u2019s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the _ first _ invitation it should be accepted . \u201d \u201c I do not know . We will ask him . But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all . \u201d There was nothing more to be said , or that could be said to any purpose , till Sir Thomas were present ; but the subject involving , as it did , her own evening \u2019s comfort for the morrow , was so much uppermost in Lady Bertram \u2019s mind , that half an hour afterwards , on his looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing - room , she called him back again , when he had almost closed the door , with \u201c Sir Thomas , stop a moment \u2014 I have something to say to you . \u201d Her tone of calm languor , for she never took the trouble of raising her voice , was always heard and attended to ; and Sir Thomas came back . Her story began ; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room ; for to hear herself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her nerves could bear . She was anxious , she knew \u2014 more anxious perhaps than she ought to be \u2014 for what was it after all whether she went or staid ? but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding , and with very grave looks , and those grave looks directed to her , and at last decide against her , she might not be able to appear properly submissive and indifferent . Her cause , meanwhile , went on well . It began , on Lady Bertram \u2019s part , with\u2014\u201cI have something to tell you that will surprise you . Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner . \u201d \u201c Well , \u201d said Sir Thomas , as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise . \u201c Edmund wants her to go . But how can I spare her ? \u201d \u201c She will be late , \u201d said Sir Thomas , taking out his watch ; \u201c but what is your difficulty ? \u201d Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his mother \u2019s story . He told the whole ; and she had only to add , \u201c So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . \u201d \u201c But is it not very natural , \u201d observed Edmund , \u201c that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? \u201d \u201c Nothing can be more natural , \u201d said Sir Thomas , after a short deliberation ; \u201c nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural . Mrs. Grant \u2019s shewing civility to Miss Price , to Lady Bertram \u2019s niece , could never want explanation . The only surprise I can feel is , that this should be the _ first _ time of its being paid . Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer . She appears to feel as she ought . But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . \u201d \u201c But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ? \u201d \u201c Indeed I think you may . \u201d \u201c She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . \u201d \u201c Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . \u201d \u201c Very well , then , Fanny may go , Edmund . \u201d The good news soon followed her . Edmund knocked at her door in his way to his own . \u201c Well , Fanny , it is all happily settled , and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle \u2019s side . He had but one opinion . You are to go . \u201d \u201c Thank you , I am _ so _ glad , \u201d was Fanny \u2019s instinctive reply ; though when she had turned from him and shut the door , she could not help feeling , \u201c And yet why should I be glad ? for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me ? \u201d In spite of this conviction , however , she was glad . Simple as such an engagement might appear in other eyes , it had novelty and importance in hers , for excepting the day at Sotherton , she had scarcely ever dined out before ; and though now going only half a mile , and only to three people , still it was dining out , and all the little interests of preparation were enjoyments in themselves . She had neither sympathy nor assistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and directed her taste ; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody , and Mrs. Norris , when she came on the morrow , in consequence of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas , was in a very ill humour , and seemed intent only on lessening her niece \u2019s pleasure , both present and future , as much as possible . \u201c Upon my word , Fanny , you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence ! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated . Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to _ you _ ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me . Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _ us _ to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all . \u201d Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant \u2019s part of the favour , that Fanny , who found herself expected to speak , could only say that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her , and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt \u2019s evening work in such a state as to prevent her being missed . \u201c Oh ! depend upon it , your aunt can do very well without you , or you would not be allowed to go . _ I _ shall be here , so you may be quite easy about your aunt . And I hope you will have a very _ agreeable _ day , and find it all mighty _ delightful _ . But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table ; and I can not but be surprised that such an _ elegant _ lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better ! And round their enormous great wide table , too , which fills up the room so dreadfully ! Had the doctor been contented to take my dining - table when I came away , as anybody in their senses would have done , instead of having that absurd new one of his own , which is wider , literally wider than the dinner - table here , how infinitely better it would have been ! and how much more he would have been respected ! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere . Remember that , Fanny . Five \u2014 only five to be sitting round that table . However , you will have dinner enough on it for ten , I dare say . \u201d Mrs. Norris fetched breath , and went on again . \u201c The nonsense and folly of people \u2019s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins \u2014 as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia . _ That _ will never do , believe me . Remember , wherever you are , you must be the lowest and last ; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage , you are not to be taking place of her . And as to coming away at night , you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses . Leave him to settle _ that _ . \u201d \u201c Yes , ma\u2019am , I should not think of anything else . \u201d \u201c And if it should rain , which I think exceedingly likely , for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life , you must manage as well as you can , and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you . I certainly do not go home to - night , and , therefore , the carriage will not be out on my account ; so you must make up your mind to what may happen , and take your things accordingly . \u201d Her niece thought it perfectly reasonable . She rated her own claims to comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could ; and when Sir Thomas soon afterwards , just opening the door , said , \u201c Fanny , at what time would you have the carriage come round ? \u201d she felt a degree of astonishment which made it impossible for her to speak . \u201c My dear Sir Thomas ! \u201d cried Mrs. Norris , red with anger , \u201c Fanny can walk . \u201d \u201c Walk ! \u201d repeated Sir Thomas , in a tone of most unanswerable dignity , and coming farther into the room . \u201c My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year ! Will twenty minutes after four suit you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir , \u201d was Fanny \u2019s humble answer , given with the feelings almost of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris ; and not bearing to remain with her in what might seem a state of triumph , she followed her uncle out of the room , having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words spoken in angry agitation \u2014 \u201c Quite unnecessary ! a great deal too kind ! But Edmund goes ; true , it is upon Edmund \u2019s account . I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night . \u201d But this could not impose on Fanny . She felt that the carriage was for herself , and herself alone : and her uncle \u2019s consideration of her , coming immediately after such representations from her aunt , cost her some tears of gratitude when she was alone . The coachman drove round to a minute ; another minute brought down the gentleman ; and as the lady had , with a most scrupulous fear of being late , been many minutes seated in the drawing - room , Sir Thomas saw them off in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required . \u201c Now I must look at you , Fanny , \u201d said Edmund , with the kind smile of an affectionate brother , \u201c and tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed . What have you got on ? \u201d \u201c The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin \u2019s marriage . I hope it is not too fine ; but I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could , and that I might not have such another opportunity all the winter . I hope you do not think me too fine . \u201d \u201c A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white . No , I see no finery about you ; nothing but what is perfectly proper . Your gown seems very pretty . I like these glossy spots . Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same ? \u201d In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable - yard and coach - house . \u201c Heyday ! \u201d said Edmund , \u201c here \u2019s company , here \u2019s a carriage ! who have they got to meet us ? \u201d And letting down the side - glass to distinguish , \u201c \u2019 Tis Crawford \u2019s , Crawford \u2019s barouche , I protest ! There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters . He is here , of course . This is quite a surprise , Fanny . I shall be very glad to see him . \u201d There was no occasion , there was no time for Fanny to say how very differently she felt ; but the idea of having such another to observe her was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing - room . In the drawing - room Mr. Crawford certainly was , having been just long enough arrived to be ready for dinner ; and the smiles and pleased looks of the three others standing round him , shewed how welcome was his sudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath . A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund ; and with the exception of Fanny , the pleasure was general ; and even to _ her _ there might be some advantage in his presence , since every addition to the party must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent and unattended to . She was soon aware of this herself ; for though she must submit , as her own propriety of mind directed , in spite of her aunt Norris \u2019s opinion , to being the principal lady in company , and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon , she found , while they were at table , such a happy flow of conversation prevailing , in which she was not required to take any part \u2014 there was so much to be said between the brother and sister about Bath , so much between the two young men about hunting , so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and Dr. Grant , and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant , as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet , and of passing a very agreeable day . She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman , however , with any appearance of interest , in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield , and sending for his hunters from Norfolk , which , suggested by Dr. Grant , advised by Edmund , and warmly urged by the two sisters , was soon in possession of his mind , and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her to resolve on . Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of the open weather , but her answers were as short and indifferent as civility allowed . She could not wish him to stay , and would much rather not have him speak to her . Her two absent cousins , especially Maria , were much in her thoughts on seeing him ; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _ his _ spirits . Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before , and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams , as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state . She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way , till they were all re - assembled in the drawing - room , when Edmund , being engaged apart in some matter of business with Dr. Grant , which seemed entirely to engross them , and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea - table , he began talking of them with more particularity to his other sister . With a significant smile , which made Fanny quite hate him , he said , \u201c So ! Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton , I understand ; happy man ! \u201d \u201c Yes , they have been there about a fortnight , Miss Price , have they not ? And Julia is with them . \u201d \u201c And Mr. Yates , I presume , is not far off . \u201d \u201c Mr. Yates ! Oh ! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates . I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park ; do you , Miss Price ? I think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates . \u201d \u201c Poor Rushworth and his two - and - forty speeches ! \u201d continued Crawford . \u201c Nobody can ever forget them . Poor fellow ! I see him now \u2014 his toil and his despair . Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her \u201d ; adding , with a momentary seriousness , \u201c She is too good for him \u2014 much too good . \u201d And then changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry , and addressing Fanny , he said , \u201c You were Mr. Rushworth \u2019s best friend . Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten , your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part \u2014 in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied \u2014 to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own ! _ He _ might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness , but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party . \u201d Fanny coloured , and said nothing . \u201c It is as a dream , a pleasant dream ! \u201d he exclaimed , breaking forth again , after a few minutes \u2019 musing . \u201c I shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure . There was such an interest , such an animation , such a spirit diffused . Everybody felt it . We were all alive . There was employment , hope , solicitude , bustle , for every hour of the day . Always some little objection , some little doubt , some little anxiety to be got over . I never was happier . \u201d With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself , \u201c Never happier!\u2014never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable!\u2014never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly ! Oh ! what a corrupted mind ! \u201d \u201c We were unlucky , Miss Price , \u201d he continued , in a lower tone , to avoid the possibility of being heard by Edmund , and not at all aware of her feelings , \u201c we certainly were very unlucky . Another week , only one other week , would have been enough for us . I think if we had had the disposal of events \u2014 if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two , about the equinox , there would have been a difference . Not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather \u2014 but only by a steady contrary wind , or a calm . I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week \u2019s calm in the Atlantic at that season . \u201d He seemed determined to be answered ; and Fanny , averting her face , said , with a firmer tone than usual , \u201c As far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day . My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive , that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough . \u201d She had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before , and never so angrily to any one ; and when her speech was over , she trembled and blushed at her own daring . He was surprised ; but after a few moments \u2019 silent consideration of her , replied in a calmer , graver tone , and as if the candid result of conviction , \u201c I believe you are right . It was more pleasant than prudent . We were getting too noisy . \u201d And then turning the conversation , he would have engaged her on some other subject , but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not advance in any . Miss Crawford , who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund , now observed , \u201c Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . \u201d \u201c The most interesting in the world , \u201d replied her brother\u2014\u201chow to make money ; how to turn a good income into a better . Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon . I find he takes orders in a few weeks . They were at it in the dining - parlour . I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off . He will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with , and earned without much trouble . I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year . Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother ; and as of course he will still live at home , it will be all for his _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ ; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter , I suppose , will be the sum total of sacrifice . \u201d His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying , \u201c Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves . You would look rather blank , Henry , if your _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ were to be limited to seven hundred a year . \u201d \u201c Perhaps I might ; but all _ that _ you know is entirely comparative . Birthright and habit must settle the business . Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet \u2019s family . By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year , and nothing to do for it . \u201d Miss Crawford _ could _ have said that there would be a something to do and to suffer for it , which she could not think lightly of ; but she checked herself and let it pass ; and tried to look calm and unconcerned when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them . \u201c Bertram , \u201d said Henry Crawford , \u201c I shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon . I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner . When is it to be ? Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ? Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time \u2014 as I shall do \u2014 not to lose a word ; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful ? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil . When will it be ? You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you . \u201d \u201c I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , \u201d said Edmund ; \u201c for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . \u201d \u201c Will he not feel this ? \u201d thought Fanny . \u201c No , he can feel nothing as he ought . \u201d The party being now all united , and the chief talkers attracting each other , she remained in tranquillity ; and as a whist - table was formed after tea \u2014 formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant , by his attentive wife , though it was not to be supposed so \u2014 and Miss Crawford took her harp , she had nothing to do but to listen ; and her tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening , except when Mr. Crawford now and then addressed to her a question or observation , which she could not avoid answering . Miss Crawford was too much vexed by what had passed to be in a humour for anything but music . With that she soothed herself and amused her friend . The assurance of Edmund \u2019s being so soon to take orders , coming upon her like a blow that had been suspended , and still hoped uncertain and at a distance , was felt with resentment and mortification . She was very angry with him . She had thought her influence more . She _ had _ begun to think of him ; she felt that she had , with great regard , with almost decided intentions ; but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings . It was plain that he could have no serious views , no true attachment , by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to . She would learn to match him in his indifference . She would henceforth admit his attentions without any idea beyond immediate amusement . If _ he _ could so command his affections , _ hers _ should do her no harm .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Fanny"}, {"position": [9, 10], "text": "her"}, {"position": [15,
