{"document": "XX Edmund \u2019s first object the next morning was to see his father alone , and give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme , defending his own share in it as far only as he could then , in a soberer moment , feel his motives to deserve , and acknowledging , with perfect ingenuousness , that his concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his judgment in it very doubtful . He was anxious , while vindicating himself , to say nothing unkind of the others : but there was only one amongst them whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defence or palliation . \u201c We have all been more or less to blame , \u201d said he , \u201c every one of us , excepting Fanny . Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout ; who has been consistent . _ Her _ feelings have been steadily against it from first to last . She never ceased to think of what was due to you . You will find Fanny everything you could wish . \u201d Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party , and at such a time , as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must ; he felt it too much , indeed , for many words ; and having shaken hands with Edmund , meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression , and forget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could , after the house had been cleared of every object enforcing the remembrance , and restored to its proper state . He did not enter into any remonstrance with his other children : he was more willing to believe they felt their error than to run the risk of investigation . The reproof of an immediate conclusion of everything , the sweep of every preparation , would be sufficient . There was one person , however , in the house , whom he could not leave to learn his sentiments merely through his conduct . He could not help giving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having hoped that her advice might have been interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly have disapproved . The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming the plan ; they ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves ; but they were young ; and , excepting Edmund , he believed , of unsteady characters ; and with greater surprise , therefore , he must regard her acquiescence in their wrong measures , her countenance of their unsafe amusements , than that such measures and such amusements should have been suggested . Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life ; for she was ashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was so glaring to Sir Thomas , and would not have admitted that her influence was insufficient \u2014 that she might have talked in vain . Her only resource was to get out of the subject as fast as possible , and turn the current of Sir Thomas \u2019s ideas into a happier channel . She had a great deal to insinuate in her own praise as to _ general _ attention to the interest and comfort of his family , much exertion and many sacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from her own fireside , and many excellent hints of distrust and economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail , whereby a most considerable saving had always arisen , and more than one bad servant been detected . But her chief strength lay in Sotherton . Her greatest support and glory was in having formed the connexion with the Rushworths . _ There _ she was impregnable . She took to herself all the credit of bringing Mr. Rushworth \u2019s admiration of Maria to any effect . \u201c If I had not been active , \u201d said she , \u201c and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle . But I left no stone unturned . I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister , and at last I did persuade her . You know the distance to Sotherton ; it was in the middle of winter , and the roads almost impassable , but I did persuade her . \u201d \u201c I know how great , how justly great , your influence is with Lady Bertram and her children , and am the more concerned that it should not have been \u2014 \u201d \u201c My dear Sir Thomas , if you had seen the state of the roads _ that _ day ! I thought we should never have got through them , though we had the four horses of course ; and poor old coachman would attend us , out of his great love and kindness , though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas . I cured him at last ; but he was very bad all the winter \u2014 and this was such a day , I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture : he was putting on his wig ; so I said , \u2018 Coachman , you had much better not go ; your Lady and I shall be very safe ; you know how steady Stephen is , and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now , that I am sure there is no fear . \u2019 But , however , I soon found it would not do ; he was bent upon going , and as I hate to be worrying and officious , I said no more ; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt , and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke , where , what with frost and snow upon beds of stones , it was worse than anything you can imagine , I was quite in an agony about him . And then the poor horses too ! To see them straining away ! You know how I always feel for the horses . And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill , what do you think I did ? You will laugh at me ; but I got out and walked up . I did indeed . It might not be saving them much , but it was something , and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals . I caught a dreadful cold , but _ that _ I did not regard . My object was accomplished in the visit . \u201d \u201c I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it . There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth \u2019s manners , but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject : his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting . He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish . \u201d \u201c Yes , indeed , and the more you know of him the better you will like him . He is not a shining character , but he has a thousand good qualities ; and is so disposed to look up to you , that I am quite laughed at about it , for everybody considers it as my doing . \u2018 Upon my word , Mrs. Norris , \u2019 said Mrs. Grant the other day , \u2018 if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own , he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect . \u2019 \u201d Sir Thomas gave up the point , foiled by her evasions , disarmed by her flattery ; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that where the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake , her kindness did sometimes overpower her judgment . It was a busy morning with him . Conversation with any of them occupied but a small part of it . He had to reinstate himself in all the wonted concerns of his Mansfield life : to see his steward and his bailiff ; to examine and compute , and , in the intervals of business , to walk into his stables and his gardens , and nearest plantations ; but active and methodical , he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat as master of the house at dinner , he had also set the carpenter to work in pulling down what had been so lately put up in the billiard - room , and given the scene - painter his dismissal long enough to justify the pleasing belief of his being then at least as far off as Northampton . The scene - painter was gone , having spoilt only the floor of one room , ruined all the coachman \u2019s sponges , and made five of the under - servants idle and dissatisfied ; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or two would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been , even to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers \u2019 Vows in the house , for he was burning all that met his eye . Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas \u2019s intentions , though as far as ever from understanding their source . He and his friend had been out with their guns the chief of the morning , and Tom had taken the opportunity of explaining , with proper apologies for his father \u2019s particularity , what was to be expected . Mr. Yates felt it as acutely as might be supposed . To be a second time disappointed in the same way was an instance of very severe ill - luck ; and his indignation was such , that had it not been for delicacy towards his friend , and his friend \u2019s youngest sister , he believed he should certainly attack the baronet on the absurdity of his proceedings , and argue him into a little more rationality . He believed this very stoutly while he was in Mansfield Wood , and all the way home ; but there was a something in Sir Thomas , when they sat round the same table , which made Mr. Yates think it wiser to let him pursue his own way , and feel the folly of it without opposition . He had known many disagreeable fathers before , and often been struck with the inconveniences they occasioned , but never , in the whole course of his life , had he seen one of that class so unintelligibly moral , so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas . He was not a man to be endured but for his children \u2019s sake , and he might be thankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof . The evening passed with external smoothness , though almost every mind was ruffled ; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony . Maria was in a good deal of agitation . It was of the utmost consequence to her that Crawford should now lose no time in declaring himself , and she was disturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance that point . She had been expecting to see him the whole morning , and all the evening , too , was still expecting him . Mr. Rushworth had set off early with the great news for Sotherton ; and she had fondly hoped for such an immediate _ eclaircissement _ as might save him the trouble of ever coming back again . But they had seen no one from the Parsonage , not a creature , and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of congratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram . It was the first day for many , many weeks , in which the families had been wholly divided . Four - and - twenty hours had never passed before , since August began , without bringing them together in some way or other . It was a sad , anxious day ; and the morrow , though differing in the sort of evil , did by no means bring less . A few moments of feverish enjoyment were followed by hours of acute suffering . Henry Crawford was again in the house : he walked up with Dr. Grant , who was anxious to pay his respects to Sir Thomas , and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the breakfast - room , where were most of the family . Sir Thomas soon appeared , and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of the man she loved to her father . Her sensations were indefinable , and so were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford , who had a chair between herself and Tom , ask the latter in an undervoice whether there were any plans for resuming the play after the present happy interruption ( with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas ) , because , in that case , he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time required by the party : he was going away immediately , being to meet his uncle at Bath without delay ; but if there were any prospect of a renewal of Lovers \u2019 Vows , he should hold himself positively engaged , he should break through every other claim , he should absolutely condition with his uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted . The play should not be lost by _ his _ absence . \u201c From Bath , Norfolk , London , York , wherever I may be , \u201d said he ; \u201c I will attend you from any place in England , at an hour \u2019s notice . \u201d It was well at that moment that Tom had to speak , and not his sister . He could immediately say with easy fluency , \u201c I am sorry you are going ; but as to our play , _ that _ is all over \u2014 entirely at an end \u201d ( looking significantly at his father ) . \u201c The painter was sent off yesterday , and very little will remain of the theatre to - morrow . I knew how _ that _ would be from the first . It is early for Bath . You will find nobody there . \u201d \u201c It is about my uncle \u2019s usual time . \u201d \u201c When do you think of going ? \u201d \u201c I may , perhaps , get as far as Banbury to - day . \u201d \u201c Whose stables do you use at Bath ? \u201d was the next question ; and while this branch of the subject was under discussion , Maria , who wanted neither pride nor resolution , was preparing to encounter her share of it with tolerable calmness . To her he soon turned , repeating much of what he had already said , with only a softened air and stronger expressions of regret . But what availed his expressions or his air ? He was going , and , if not voluntarily going , voluntarily intending to stay away ; for , excepting what might be due to his uncle , his engagements were all self - imposed . He might talk of necessity , but she knew his independence . The hand which had so pressed hers to his heart ! the hand and the heart were alike motionless and passive now ! Her spirit supported her , but the agony of her mind was severe . She had not long to endure what arose from listening to language which his actions contradicted , or to bury the tumult of her feelings under the restraint of society ; for general civilities soon called his notice from her , and the farewell visit , as it then became openly acknowledged , was a very short one . He was gone \u2014 he had touched her hand for the last time , he had made his parting bow , and she might seek directly all that solitude could do for her . Henry Crawford was gone , gone from the house , and within two hours afterwards from the parish ; and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised in Maria and Julia Bertram . Julia could rejoice that he was gone . His presence was beginning to be odious to her ; and if Maria gained him not , she was now cool enough to dispense with any other revenge . She did not want exposure to be added to desertion . Henry Crawford gone , she could even pity her sister . With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence . She heard it at dinner , and felt it a blessing . By all the others it was mentioned with regret ; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling \u2014 from the sincerity of Edmund \u2019s too partial regard , to the unconcern of his mother speaking entirely by rote . Mrs. Norris began to look about her , and wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing ; and could almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it ; but with so many to care for , how was it possible for even _ her _ activity to keep pace with her wishes ? Another day or two , and Mr. Yates was gone likewise . In _ his _ departure Sir Thomas felt the chief interest : wanting to be alone with his family , the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been irksome ; but of him , trifling and confident , idle and expensive , it was every way vexatious . In himself he was wearisome , but as the friend of Tom and the admirer of Julia he became offensive . Sir Thomas had been quite indifferent to Mr. Crawford \u2019s going or staying : but his good wishes for Mr. Yates \u2019s having a pleasant journey , as he walked with him to the hall - door , were given with genuine satisfaction . Mr. Yates had staid to see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield , the removal of everything appertaining to the play : he left the house in all the soberness of its general character ; and Sir Thomas hoped , in seeing him out of it , to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme , and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of its existence . Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that might have distressed him . The curtain , over which she had presided with such talent and such success , went off with her to her cottage , where she happened to be particularly in want of green baize . XXI Sir Thomas \u2019s return made a striking change in the ways of the family , independent of Lovers \u2019 Vows . Under his government , Mansfield was an altered place . Some members of their society sent away , and the spirits of many others saddened \u2014 it was all sameness and gloom compared with the past \u2014 a sombre family party rarely enlivened . There was little intercourse with the Parsonage . Sir Thomas , drawing back from intimacies in general , was particularly disinclined , at this time , for any engagements but in one quarter . The Rushworths were the only addition to his own domestic circle which he could solicit . Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father \u2019s feelings , nor could he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants . \u201c But they , \u201d he observed to Fanny , \u201c have a claim . They seem to belong to us ; they seem to be part of ourselves . I could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away . I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected . But the truth is , that my father hardly knows them . They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England . If he knew them better , he would value their society as it deserves ; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like . We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves : my sisters seem out of spirits , and Tom is certainly not at his ease . Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us , and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father . \u201d \u201c Do you think so ? \u201d said Fanny : \u201c in my opinion , my uncle would not like _ any _ addition . I think he values the very quietness you speak of , and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants . And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be \u2014 I mean before my uncle went abroad . As well as I can recollect , it was always much the same . There was never much laughing in his presence ; or , if there is any difference , it is not more , I think , than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first . There must be a sort of shyness ; but I can not recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry , except when my uncle was in town . No young people \u2019s are , I suppose , when those they look up to are at home \u201d . \u201c I believe you are right , Fanny , \u201d was his reply , after a short consideration . \u201c I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were , than assuming a new character . The novelty was in their being lively . Yet , how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give ! I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before . \u201d \u201c I suppose I am graver than other people , \u201d said Fanny . \u201c The evenings do not appear long to me . I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies . I could listen to him for an hour together . It entertains _ me _ more than many other things have done ; but then I am unlike other people , I dare say . \u201d \u201c Why should you dare say _ that _ ? \u201d ( smiling ) . \u201c Do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet ? But when did you , or anybody , ever get a compliment from me , Fanny ? Go to my father if you want to be complimented . He will satisfy you . Ask your uncle what he thinks , and you will hear compliments enough : and though they may be chiefly on your person , you must put up with it , and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time . \u201d Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her . \u201c Your uncle thinks you very pretty , dear Fanny \u2014 and that is the long and the short of the matter . Anybody but myself would have made something more of it , and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before ; but the truth is , that your uncle never did admire you till now \u2014 and now he does . Your complexion is so improved!\u2014and you have gained so much countenance!\u2014and your figure \u2014 nay , Fanny , do not turn away about it \u2014 it is but an uncle . If you can not bear an uncle \u2019s admiration , what is to become of you ? You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at . You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman . \u201d \u201c Oh ! do n\u2019t talk so , do n\u2019t talk so , \u201d cried Fanny , distressed by more feelings than he was aware of ; but seeing that she was distressed , he had done with the subject , and only added more seriously \u2014 \u201c Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect ; and I only wish you would talk to him more . You are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle . \u201d \u201c But I do talk to him more than I used . I am sure I do . Did not you hear me ask him about the slave - trade last night ? \u201d \u201c I did \u2014 and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others . It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther . \u201d \u201c And I longed to do it \u2014 but there was such a dead silence ! And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word , or seeming at all interested in the subject , I did not like \u2014 I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense , by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel . \u201d \u201c Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day : that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect . We were talking of you at the Parsonage , and those were her words . She has great discernment . I know nobody who distinguishes characters better . For so young a woman it is remarkable ! She certainly understands _ you _ better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long ; and with regard to some others , I can perceive , from occasional lively hints , the unguarded expressions of the moment , that she could define _ many _ as accurately , did not delicacy forbid it . I wonder what she thinks of my father ! She must admire him as a fine - looking man , with most gentlemanlike , dignified , consistent manners ; but perhaps , having seen him so seldom , his reserve may be a little repulsive . Could they be much together , I feel sure of their liking each other . He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers . I wish they met more frequently ! I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side . \u201d \u201c She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you , \u201d said Fanny , with half a sigh , \u201c to have any such apprehension . And Sir Thomas \u2019s wishing just at first to be only with his family , is so very natural , that she can argue nothing from that . After a little while , I dare say , we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way , allowing for the difference of the time of year . \u201d \u201c This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her infancy . I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . \u201d Fanny could have said a great deal , but it was safer to say nothing , and leave untouched all Miss Crawford \u2019s resources \u2014 her accomplishments , her spirits , her importance , her friends , lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome . Miss Crawford \u2019s kind opinion of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance , and she began to talk of something else . \u201c To - morrow , I think , my uncle dines at Sotherton , and you and Mr. Bertram too . We shall be quite a small party at home . I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth . \u201d \u201c That is impossible , Fanny . He must like him less after to - morrow \u2019s visit , for we shall be five hours in his company . I should dread the stupidity of the day , if there were not a much greater evil to follow \u2014 the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas . He can not much longer deceive himself . I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . \u201d In this quarter , indeed , disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas . Not all his good - will for Mr. Rushworth , not all Mr. Rushworth \u2019s deference for him , could prevent him from soon discerning some part of the truth \u2014 that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man , as ignorant in business as in books , with opinions in general unfixed , and without seeming much aware of it himself . He had expected a very different son - in - law ; and beginning to feel grave on Maria \u2019s account , tried to understand _ her _ feelings . Little observation there was necessary to tell him that indifference was the most favourable state they could be in . Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth was careless and cold . She could not , did not like him . Sir Thomas resolved to speak seriously to her . Advantageous as would be the alliance , and long standing and public as was the engagement , her happiness must not be sacrificed to it . Mr. Rushworth had , perhaps , been accepted on too short an acquaintance , and , on knowing him better , she was repenting . With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her : told her his fears , inquired into her wishes , entreated her to be open and sincere , and assured her that every inconvenience should be braved , and the connexion entirely given up , if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it . He would act for her and release her . Maria had a moment \u2019s struggle as she listened , and only a moment \u2019s : when her father ceased , she was able to give her answer immediately , decidedly , and with no apparent agitation . She thanked him for his great attention , his paternal kindness , but he was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking through her engagement , or was sensible of any change of opinion or inclination since her forming it . She had the highest esteem for Mr. Rushworth \u2019s character and disposition , and could not have a doubt of her happiness with him . Sir Thomas was satisfied ; too glad to be satisfied , perhaps , to urge the matter quite so far as his judgment might have dictated to others . It was an alliance which he could not have relinquished without pain ; and thus he reasoned . Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve . Mr. Rushworth must and would improve in good society ; and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness with him , speaking certainly without the prejudice , the blindness of love , she ought to be believed . Her feelings , probably , were not acute ; he had never supposed them to be so ; but her comforts might not be less on that account ; and if she could dispense with seeing her husband a leading , shining character , there would certainly be everything else in her favour . A well - disposed young woman , who did not marry for love , was in general but the more attached to her own family ; and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield must naturally hold out the greatest temptation , and would , in all probability , be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent enjoyments . Such and such - like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas , happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture , the wonder , the reflections , the reproach that must attend it ; happy to secure a marriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and influence , and very happy to think anything of his daughter \u2019s disposition that was most favourable for the purpose . To her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him . She was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall : that she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton ; that she was safe from the possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions , and destroying her prospects ; and retired in proud resolve , determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future , that her father might not be again suspecting her . Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after Henry Crawford \u2019s leaving Mansfield , before her feelings were at all tranquillised , before she had given up every hope of him , or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival , her answer might have been different ; but after another three or four days , when there was no return , no letter , no message , no symptom of a softened heart , no hope of advantage from separation , her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self revenge could give . Henry Crawford had destroyed her happiness , but he should not know that he had done it ; he should not destroy her credit , her appearance , her prosperity , too . He should not have to think of her as pining in the retirement of Mansfield for _ him _ , rejecting Sotherton and London , independence and splendour , for _ his _ sake . Independence was more needful than ever ; the want of it at Mansfield more sensibly felt . She was less and less able to endure the restraint which her father imposed . The liberty which his absence had given was now become absolutely necessary . She must escape from him and Mansfield as soon as possible , and find consolation in fortune and consequence , bustle and the world , for a wounded spirit . Her mind was quite determined , and varied not . To such feelings delay , even the delay of much preparation , would have been an evil , and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the marriage than herself . In all the important preparations of the mind she was complete : being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home , restraint , and tranquillity ; by the misery of disappointed affection , and contempt of the man she was to marry . The rest might wait . The preparations of new carriages and furniture might wait for London and spring , when her own taste could have fairer play . The principals being all agreed in this respect , it soon appeared that a very few weeks would be sufficient for such arrangements as must precede the wedding . Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire , and make way for the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected ; and very early in November removed herself , her maid , her footman , and her chariot , with true dowager propriety , to Bath , there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her evening parties ; enjoying them as thoroughly , perhaps , in the animation of a card - table , as she had ever done on the spot ; and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another mistress . It was a very proper wedding . The bride was elegantly dressed ; the two bridesmaids were duly inferior ; her father gave her away ; her mother stood with salts in her hand , expecting to be agitated ; her aunt tried to cry ; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant . Nothing could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the neighbourhood , except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia from the church - door to Sotherton was the same chaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before . In everything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictest investigation . It was done , and they were gone . Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father must feel , and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his wife had been apprehensive of for herself , but had fortunately escaped . Mrs. Norris , most happy to assist in the duties of the day , by spending it at the Park to support her sister \u2019s spirits , and drinking the health of Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two , was all joyous delight ; for she had made the match ; she had done everything ; and no one would have supposed , from her confident triumph , that she had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life , or could have the smallest insight into the disposition of the niece who had been brought up under her eye . The plan of the young couple was to proceed , after a few days , to Brighton , and take a house there for some weeks . Every public place was new to Maria , and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer . When the novelty of amusement there was over , it would be time for the wider range of London . Julia was to go with them to Brighton . Since rivalry between the sisters had ceased , they had been gradually recovering much of their former good understanding ; and were at least sufficiently friends to make each of them exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time . Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady ; and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria , though she might not have struggled through so much to obtain them , and could better bear a subordinate situation . Their departure made another material change at Mansfield , a chasm which required some time to fill up . The family circle became greatly contracted ; and though the Miss Bertrams had latterly added little to its gaiety , they could not but be missed .
