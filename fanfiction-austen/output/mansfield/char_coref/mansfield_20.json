{"document": "XL Fanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now at the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun ; Mary \u2019s next letter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last , but she was not right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great relief to herself . Here was another strange revolution of mind ! She was really glad to receive the letter when it did come . In her present exile from good society , and distance from everything that had been wo nt to interest her , a letter from one belonging to the set where her heart lived , written with affection , and some degree of elegance , was thoroughly acceptable . The usual plea of increasing engagements was made in excuse for not having written to her earlier ; \u201c And now that I have begun , \u201d she continued , \u201c my letter will not be worth your reading , for there will be no little offering of love at the end , no three or four lines _ passionn\u00e9es _ from the most devoted H. C. in the world , for Henry is in Norfolk ; business called him to Everingham ten days ago , or perhaps he only pretended the call , for the sake of being travelling at the same time that you were . But there he is , and , by the bye , his absence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister \u2019s in writing , for there has been no \u2018 Well , Mary , when do you write to Fanny ? Is not it time for you to write to Fanny ? \u2019 to spur me on . At last , after various attempts at meeting , I have seen your cousins , \u2018 dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth \u2019 ; they found me at home yesterday , and we were glad to see each other again . We _ seemed _ _ very _ glad to see each other , and I do really think we were a little . We had a vast deal to say . Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned ? I did not use to think her wanting in self - possession , but she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday . Upon the whole , Julia was in the best looks of the two , at least after you were spoken of . There was no recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of \u2018 Fanny , \u2019 and spoke of her as a sister should . But Mrs. Rushworth \u2019s day of good looks will come ; we have cards for her first party on the 28th . Then she will be in beauty , for she will open one of the best houses in Wimpole Street . I was in it two years ago , when it was Lady Lascelle \u2019s , and prefer it to almost any I know in London , and certainly she will then feel , to use a vulgar phrase , that she has got her pennyworth for her penny . Henry could not have afforded her such a house . I hope she will recollect it , and be satisfied , as well as she may , with moving the queen of a palace , though the king may appear best in the background ; and as I have no desire to tease her , I shall never _ force _ your name upon her again . She will grow sober by degrees . From all that I hear and guess , Baron Wildenheim \u2019s attentions to Julia continue , but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement . She ought to do better . A poor honourable is no catch , and I can not imagine any liking in the case , for take away his rants , and the poor baron has nothing . What a difference a vowel makes ! If his rents were but equal to his rants ! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly ; detained , perchance , by parish duties . There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted . I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _ young _ one . Adieu ! my dear sweet Fanny , this is a long letter from London : write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry \u2019s eyes , when he comes back , and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake . \u201d There was great food for meditation in this letter , and chiefly for unpleasant meditation ; and yet , with all the uneasiness it supplied , it connected her with the absent , it told her of people and things about whom she had never felt so much curiosity as now , and she would have been glad to have been sure of such a letter every week . Her correspondence with her aunt Bertram was her only concern of higher interest . As for any society in Portsmouth , that could at all make amends for deficiencies at home , there were none within the circle of her father \u2019s and mother \u2019s acquaintance to afford her the smallest satisfaction : she saw nobody in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own shyness and reserve . The men appeared to her all coarse , the women all pert , everybody underbred ; and she gave as little contentment as she received from introductions either to old or new acquaintance . The young ladies who approached her at first with some respect , in consideration of her coming from a baronet \u2019s family , were soon offended by what they termed \u201c airs \u201d ; for , as she neither played on the pianoforte nor wore fine pelisses , they could , on farther observation , admit no right of superiority . The first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home , the first which her judgment could entirely approve , and which gave any promise of durability , was in a better knowledge of Susan , and a hope of being of service to her . Susan had always behaved pleasantly to herself , but the determined character of her general manners had astonished and alarmed her , and it was at least a fortnight before she began to understand a disposition so totally different from her own . Susan saw that much was wrong at home , and wanted to set it right . That a girl of fourteen , acting only on her own unassisted reason , should err in the method of reform , was not wonderful ; and Fanny soon became more disposed to admire the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguish justly , than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led . Susan was only acting on the same truths , and pursuing the same system , which her own judgment acknowledged , but which her more supine and yielding temper would have shrunk from asserting . Susan tried to be useful , where _ she _ could only have gone away and cried ; and that Susan was useful she could perceive ; that things , bad as they were , would have been worse but for such interposition , and that both her mother and Betsey were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgence and vulgarity . In every argument with her mother , Susan had in point of reason the advantage , and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off . The blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she had never known . There was no gratitude for affection past or present to make her better bear with its excesses to the others . All this became gradually evident , and gradually placed Susan before her sister as an object of mingled compassion and respect . That her manner was wrong , however , at times very wrong , her measures often ill - chosen and ill - timed , and her looks and language very often indefensible , Fanny could not cease to feel ; but she began to hope they might be rectified . Susan , she found , looked up to her and wished for her good opinion ; and new as anything like an office of authority was to Fanny , new as it was to imagine herself capable of guiding or informing any one , she did resolve to give occasional hints to Susan , and endeavour to exercise for her advantage the juster notions of what was due to everybody , and what would be wisest for herself , which her own more favoured education had fixed in her . Her influence , or at least the consciousness and use of it , originated in an act of kindness by Susan , which , after many hesitations of delicacy , she at last worked herself up to . It had very early occurred to her that a small sum of money might , perhaps , restore peace for ever on the sore subject of the silver knife , canvassed as it now was continually , and the riches which she was in possession of herself , her uncle having given her \u00a3 10 at parting , made her as able as she was willing to be generous . But she was so wholly unused to confer favours , except on the very poor , so unpractised in removing evils , or bestowing kindnesses among her equals , and so fearful of appearing to elevate herself as a great lady at home , that it took some time to determine that it would not be unbecoming in her to make such a present . It was made , however , at last : a silver knife was bought for Betsey , and accepted with great delight , its newness giving it every advantage over the other that could be desired ; Susan was established in the full possession of her own , Betsey handsomely declaring that now she had got one so much prettier herself , she should never want _ that _ again ; and no reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother , which Fanny had almost feared to be impossible . The deed thoroughly answered : a source of domestic altercation was entirely done away , and it was the means of opening Susan \u2019s heart to her , and giving her something more to love and be interested in . Susan shewed that she had delicacy : pleased as she was to be mistress of property which she had been struggling for at least two years , she yet feared that her sister \u2019s judgment had been against her , and that a reproof was designed her for having so struggled as to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of the house . Her temper was open . She acknowledged her fears , blamed herself for having contended so warmly ; and from that hour Fanny , understanding the worth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment , began to feel again the blessing of affection , and to entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in need of help , and so much deserving it . She gave advice , advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding , and given so mildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect temper , and she had the happiness of observing its good effects not unfrequently . More was not expected by one who , while seeing all the obligation and expediency of submission and forbearance , saw also with sympathetic acuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating to a girl like Susan . Her greatest wonder on the subject soon became \u2014 not that Susan should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience against her better knowledge \u2014 but that so much better knowledge , so many good notions should have been hers at all ; and that , brought up in the midst of negligence and error , she should have formed such proper opinions of what ought to be ; she , who had had no cousin Edmund to direct her thoughts or fix her principles . The intimacy thus begun between them was a material advantage to each . By sitting together upstairs , they avoided a great deal of the disturbance of the house ; Fanny had peace , and Susan learned to think it no misfortune to be quietly employed . They sat without a fire ; but that was a privation familiar even to Fanny , and she suffered the less because reminded by it of the East room . It was the only point of resemblance . In space , light , furniture , and prospect , there was nothing alike in the two apartments ; and she often heaved a sigh at the remembrance of all her books and boxes , and various comforts there . By degrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs , at first only in working and talking , but after a few days , the remembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny found it impossible not to try for books again . There were none in her father \u2019s house ; but wealth is luxurious and daring , and some of hers found its way to a circulating library . She became a subscriber ; amazed at being anything _ in propria persona _ , amazed at her own doings in every way , to be a renter , a chuser of books ! And to be having any one \u2019s improvement in view in her choice ! But so it was . Susan had read nothing , and Fanny longed to give her a share in her own first pleasures , and inspire a taste for the biography and poetry which she delighted in herself . In this occupation she hoped , moreover , to bury some of the recollections of Mansfield , which were too apt to seize her mind if her fingers only were busy ; and , especially at this time , hoped it might be useful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London , whither , on the authority of her aunt \u2019s last letter , she knew he was gone . She had no doubt of what would ensue . The promised notification was hanging over her head . The postman \u2019s knock within the neighbourhood was beginning to bring its daily terrors , and if reading could banish the idea for even half an hour , it was something gained . XLI A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town , and Fanny had heard nothing of him . There were three different conclusions to be drawn from his silence , between which her mind was in fluctuation ; each of them at times being held the most probable . Either his going had been again delayed , or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone , or he was too happy for letter - writing ! One morning , about this time , Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield , a point which she never failed to think over and calculate every day , as she and Susan were preparing to remove , as usual , upstairs , they were stopped by the knock of a visitor , whom they felt they could not avoid , from Rebecca \u2019s alertness in going to the door , a duty which always interested her beyond any other . It was a gentleman \u2019s voice ; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning pale about , when Mr. Crawford walked into the room . Good sense , like hers , will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name , as that of \u201c William \u2019s friend , \u201d though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment . The consciousness of his being known there only as William \u2019s friend was some support . Having introduced him , however , and being all reseated , the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead to were overpowering , and she fancied herself on the point of fainting away . While trying to keep herself alive , their visitor , who had at first approached her with as animated a countenance as ever , was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away , and giving her time to recover , while he devoted himself entirely to her mother , addressing her , and attending to her with the utmost politeness and propriety , at the same time with a degree of friendliness , of interest at least , which was making his manner perfect . Mrs. Price \u2019s manners were also at their best . Warmed by the sight of such a friend to her son , and regulated by the wish of appearing to advantage before him , she was overflowing with gratitude \u2014 artless , maternal gratitude \u2014 which could not be unpleasing . Mr. Price was out , which she regretted very much . Fanny was just recovered enough to feel that _ she _ could not regret it ; for to her many other sources of uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he found her . She might scold herself for the weakness , but there was no scolding it away . She was ashamed , and she would have been yet more ashamed of her father than of all the rest . They talked of William , a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire ; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish . She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life ; and was only astonished to find that , so great and so agreeable as he was , he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port - admiral , nor the commissioner , nor yet with the intention of going over to the island , nor of seeing the dockyard . Nothing of all that she had been used to think of as the proof of importance , or the employment of wealth , had brought him to Portsmouth . He had reached it late the night before , was come for a day or two , was staying at the Crown , had accidentally met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since his arrival , but had no object of that kind in coming . By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers . Fanny listened collectedly , even to the last - mentioned circumstance ; nay , it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty ; and the words , \u201c then by this time it is all settled , \u201d passed internally , without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush . After talking a little more about Mansfield , a subject in which her interest was most apparent , Crawford began to hint at the expediency of an early walk . \u201c It was a lovely morning , and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off , that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise \u201d ; and such hints producing nothing , he soon proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her daughters to take their walk without loss of time . Now they came to an understanding . Mrs. Price , it appeared , scarcely ever stirred out of doors , except of a Sunday ; she owned she could seldom , with her large family , find time for a walk . \u201c Would she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? \u201d Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying . \u201c Her daughters were very much confined ; Portsmouth was a sad place ; they did not often get out ; and she knew they had some errands in the town , which they would be very glad to do . \u201d And the consequence was , that Fanny , strange as it was \u2014 strange , awkward , and distressing \u2014 found herself and Susan , within ten minutes , walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford . It was soon pain upon pain , confusion upon confusion ; for they were hardly in the High Street before they met her father , whose appearance was not the better from its being Saturday . He stopt ; and , ungentlemanlike as he looked , Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford . She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford must be struck . He must be ashamed and disgusted altogether . He must soon give her up , and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match ; and yet , though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured , this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint ; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever , agreeable man , than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations . Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father - in - law with any idea of taking him for a model in dress ; but ( as Fanny instantly , and to her great relief , discerned ) her father was a very different man , a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected stranger , from what he was in his own family at home . His manners now , though not polished , were more than passable : they were grateful , animated , manly ; his expressions were those of an attached father , and a sensible man ; his loud tones did very well in the open air , and there was not a single oath to be heard . Such was his instinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford ; and , be the consequence what it might , Fanny \u2019s immediate feelings were infinitely soothed . The conclusion of the two gentlemen \u2019s civilities was an offer of Mr. Price \u2019s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard , which Mr. Crawford , desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such , though he had seen the dockyard again and again , and hoping to be so much the longer with Fanny , was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of , if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue ; and as it was somehow or other ascertained , or inferred , or at least acted upon , that they were not at all afraid , to the dockyard they were all to go ; and but for Mr. Crawford , Mr. Price would have turned thither directly , without the smallest consideration for his daughters \u2019 errands in the High Street . He took care , however , that they should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly to visit ; and it did not delay them long , for Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience , or be waited for , that before the gentlemen , as they stood at the door , could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations , or settle the number of three - deckers now in commission , their companions were ready to proceed . They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once , and the walk would have been conducted \u2014 according to Mr. Crawford \u2019s opinion \u2014 in a singular manner , had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it , as the two girls , he found , would have been left to follow , and keep up with them or not , as they could , while they walked on together at their own hasty pace . He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally , though by no means to the extent he wished ; he absolutely would not walk away from them ; and at any crossing or any crowd , when Mr. Price was only calling out , \u201c Come , girls ; come , Fan ; come , Sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! \u201d he would give them his particular attendance . Once fairly in the dockyard , he began to reckon upon some happy intercourse with Fanny , as they were very soon joined by a brother lounger of Mr. Price \u2019s , who was come to take his daily survey of how things went on , and who must prove a far more worthy companion than himself ; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied going about together , and discussing matters of equal and never - failing interest , while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard , or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at . Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest . Crawford could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down ; but he could have wished her sister away . A quick - looking girl of Susan \u2019s age was the very worst third in the world : totally different from Lady Bertram , all eyes and ears ; and there was no introducing the main point before her . He must content himself with being only generally agreeable , and letting Susan have her share of entertainment , with the indulgence , now and then , of a look or hint for the better - informed and conscious Fanny . Norfolk was what he had mostly to talk of : there he had been some time , and everything there was rising in importance from his present schemes . Such a man could come from no place , no society , without importing something to amuse ; his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use , and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her . For Fanny , somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness of the parties he had been in . For her approbation , the particular reason of his going into Norfolk at all , at this unusual time of year , was given . It had been real business , relative to the renewal of a lease in which the welfare of a large and \u2014 he believed \u2014 industrious family was at stake . He had suspected his agent of some underhand dealing ; of meaning to bias him against the deserving ; and he had determined to go himself , and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case . He had gone , had done even more good than he had foreseen , had been useful to more than his first plan had comprehended , and was now able to congratulate himself upon it , and to feel that in performing a duty , he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind . He had introduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before ; he had begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence , though on his own estate , had been hitherto unknown to him . This was aimed , and well aimed , at Fanny . It was pleasing to hear him speak so properly ; here he had been acting as he ought to do . To be the friend of the poor and the oppressed ! Nothing could be more grateful to her ; and she was on the point of giving him an approving look , when it was all frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of his hoping soon to have an assistant , a friend , a guide in every plan of utility or charity for Everingham : a somebody that would make Everingham and all about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet . She turned away , and wished he would not say such things . She was willing to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been wo nt to suppose . She began to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last ; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her , and ought not to think of her . He perceived that enough had been said of Everingham , and that it would be as well to talk of something else , and turned to Mansfield . He could not have chosen better ; that was a topic to bring back her attention and her looks almost instantly . It was a real indulgence to her to hear or to speak of Mansfield . Now so long divided from everybody who knew the place , she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it , and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts , and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium , in speaking of her uncle as all that was clever and good , and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet tempers . He had a great attachment to Mansfield himself ; he said so ; he looked forward with the hope of spending much , very much , of his time there ; always there , or in the neighbourhood . He particularly built upon a very happy summer and autumn there this year ; he felt that it would be so : he depended upon it ; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the last . As animated , as diversified , as social , but with circumstances of superiority undescribable . \u201c Mansfield , Sotherton , Thornton Lacey , \u201d he continued ; \u201c what a society will be comprised in those houses ! And at Michaelmas , perhaps , a fourth may be added : some small hunting - box in the vicinity of everything so dear ; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey , as Edmund Bertram once good - humouredly proposed , I hope I foresee two objections : two fair , excellent , irresistible objections to that plan . \u201d Fanny was doubly silenced here ; though when the moment was passed , could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning , and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and Edmund . It was a subject which she must learn to speak of , and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon be quite unpardonable . When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished , or had time for , the others were ready to return ; and in the course of their walk back , Mr. Crawford contrived a minute \u2019s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people \u2019s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable \u2014 so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved . She wished the next day over , she wished he had come only for one day ; but it was not so very bad as she would have expected : the pleasure of talking of Mansfield was so very great ! Before they parted , she had to thank him for another pleasure , and one of no trivial kind . Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his mutton with them , and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror , before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement . He was engaged to dinner already both for that day and the next ; he had met with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied ; he should have the honour , however , of waiting on them again on the morrow , etc . , and so they parted \u2014 Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible an evil ! To have had him join their family dinner - party , and see all their deficiencies , would have been dreadful ! Rebecca \u2019s cookery and Rebecca \u2019s waiting , and Betsey \u2019s eating at table without restraint , and pulling everything about as she chose , were what Fanny herself was not yet enough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal . _ She _ was nice only from natural delicacy , but _ he _ had been brought up in a school of luxury and epicurism .", "clusters": [{"mentions":
