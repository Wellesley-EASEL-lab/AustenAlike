{"document": "VIII Fanny \u2019s rides recommenced the very next day ; and as it was a pleasant fresh - feeling morning , less hot than the weather had lately been , Edmund trusted that her losses , both of health and pleasure , would be soon made good . While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived , escorting his mother , who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially , in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton , which had been started a fortnight before , and which , in consequence of her subsequent absence from home , had since lain dormant . Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all well pleased with its revival , and an early day was named and agreed to , provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged : the young ladies did not forget that stipulation , and though Mrs. Norris would willingly have answered for his being so , they would neither authorise the liberty nor run the risk ; and at last , on a hint from Miss Bertram , Mr. Rushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down to the Parsonage directly , and call on Mr. Crawford , and inquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not . Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in . Having been out some time , and taken a different route to the house , they had not met him . Comfortable hopes , however , were given that he would find Mr. Crawford at home . The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course . It was hardly possible , indeed , that anything else should be talked of , for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it ; and Mrs. Rushworth , a well - meaning , civil , prosing , pompous woman , who thought nothing of consequence , but as it related to her own and her son \u2019s concerns , had not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party . Lady Bertram constantly declined it ; but her placid manner of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come , till Mrs. Norris \u2019s more numerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth . \u201c The fatigue would be too much for my sister , a great deal too much , I assure you , my dear Mrs. Rushworth . Ten miles there , and ten back , you know . You must excuse my sister on this occasion , and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her . Sotherton is the only place that could give her a _ wish _ to go so far , but it can not be , indeed . She will have a companion in Fanny Price , you know , so it will all do very well ; and as for Edmund , as he is not here to speak for himself , I will answer for his being most happy to join the party . He can go on horseback , you know . \u201d Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram \u2019s staying at home , could only be sorry . \u201c The loss of her ladyship \u2019s company would be a great drawback , and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too , Miss Price , who had never been at Sotherton yet , and it was a pity she should not see the place . \u201d \u201c You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , \u201d cried Mrs. Norris ; \u201c but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . She has time enough before her ; and her going now is quite out of the question . Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her . \u201d \u201c Oh no ! I can not do without Fanny . \u201d Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next , under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton , to include Miss Crawford in the invitation ; and though Mrs. Grant , who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth , on her coming into the neighbourhood , civilly declined it on her own account , she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister ; and Mary , properly pressed and persuaded , was not long in accepting her share of the civility . Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful ; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled for Wednesday , to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her carriage , and walk half - way down the park with the two other ladies . On his return to the breakfast - room , he found Mrs. Norris trying to make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford \u2019s being of the party were desirable or not , or whether her brother \u2019s barouche would not be full without her . The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea , assuring her that the barouche would hold four perfectly well , independent of the box , on which _ one _ might go with him . \u201c But why is it necessary , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c that Crawford \u2019s carriage , or his _ only _ , should be employed ? Why is no use to be made of my mother \u2019s chaise ? I could not , when the scheme was first mentioned the other day , understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family . \u201d \u201c What ! \u201d cried Julia : \u201c go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather , when we may have seats in a barouche ! No , my dear Edmund , that will not quite do . \u201d \u201c Besides , \u201d said Maria , \u201c I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us . After what passed at first , he would claim it as a promise . \u201d \u201c And , my dear Edmund , \u201d added Mrs. Norris , \u201c taking out _ two _ carriages when _ one _ will do , would be trouble for nothing ; and , between ourselves , coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton : he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage , and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas , when he comes home , find all the varnish scratched off . \u201d \u201c That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford \u2019s , \u201d said Maria ; \u201c but the truth is , that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow , and does not know how to drive . I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday . \u201d \u201c There is no hardship , I suppose , nothing unpleasant , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c in going on the barouche box . \u201d \u201c Unpleasant ! \u201d cried Maria : \u201c oh dear ! I believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat . There can be no comparison as to one \u2019s view of the country . Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche - box herself . \u201d \u201c There can be no objection , then , to Fanny \u2019s going with you ; there can be no doubt of your having room for her . \u201d \u201c Fanny ! \u201d repeated Mrs. Norris ; \u201c my dear Edmund , there is no idea of her going with us . She stays with her aunt . I told Mrs. Rushworth so . She is not expected . \u201d \u201c You can have no reason , I imagine , madam , \u201d said he , addressing his mother , \u201c for wishing Fanny _ not _ to be of the party , but as it relates to yourself , to your own comfort . If you could do without her , you would not wish to keep her at home ? \u201d \u201c To be sure not , but I _ can not _ do without her . \u201d \u201c You can , if I stay at home with you , as I mean to do . \u201d There was a general cry out at this . \u201c Yes , \u201d he continued , \u201c there is no necessity for my going , and I mean to stay at home . Fanny has a great desire to see Sotherton . I know she wishes it very much . She has not often a gratification of the kind , and I am sure , ma\u2019am , you would be glad to give her the pleasure now ? \u201d \u201c Oh yes ! very glad , if your aunt sees no objection . \u201d Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could remain \u2014 their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could not go , and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in taking her , which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over . It must have the strangest appearance ! It would be something so very unceremonious , so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth , whose own manners were such a pattern of good - breeding and attention , that she really did not feel equal to it . Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny , and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time ; but her opposition to Edmund _ now _ , arose more from partiality for her own scheme , because it _ was _ her own , than from anything else . She felt that she had arranged everything extremely well , and that any alteration must be for the worse . When Edmund , therefore , told her in reply , as he did when she would give him the hearing , that she need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth \u2019s account , because he had taken the opportunity , as he walked with her through the hall , of mentioning Miss Price as one who would probably be of the party , and had directly received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin , Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with a very good grace , and would only say , \u201c Very well , very well , just as you chuse , settle it your own way , I am sure I do not care about it . \u201d \u201c It seems very odd , \u201d said Maria , \u201c that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . \u201d \u201c I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , \u201d added Julia , hastily leaving the room as she spoke , from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at home herself . \u201c Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires , \u201d was Edmund \u2019s only reply , and the subject dropt . Fanny \u2019s gratitude , when she heard the plan , was , in fact , much greater than her pleasure . She felt Edmund \u2019s kindness with all , and more than all , the sensibility which he , unsuspicious of her fond attachment , could be aware of ; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her account gave her pain , and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton would be nothing without him . The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another alteration in the plan , and one that was admitted with general approbation . Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to Lady Bertram in lieu of her son , and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner . Lady Bertram was very well pleased to have it so , and the young ladies were in spirits again . Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party ; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan , and had it at her tongue \u2019s end , and was on the point of proposing it , when Mrs. Grant spoke . Wednesday was fine , and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived , Mr. Crawford driving his sisters ; and as everybody was ready , there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places . The place of all places , the envied seat , the post of honour , was unappropriated . To whose happy lot was it to fall ? While each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best , and with the most appearance of obliging the others , to secure it , the matter was settled by Mrs. Grant \u2019s saying , as she stepped from the carriage , \u201c As there are five of you , it will be better that one should sit with Henry ; and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive , Julia , I think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson . \u201d Happy Julia ! Unhappy Maria ! The former was on the barouche - box in a moment , the latter took her seat within , in gloom and mortification ; and the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies , and the barking of Pug in his mistress \u2019s arms . Their road was through a pleasant country ; and Fanny , whose rides had never been extensive , was soon beyond her knowledge , and was very happy in observing all that was new , and admiring all that was pretty . She was not often invited to join in the conversation of the others , nor did she desire it . Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best companions ; and , in observing the appearance of the country , the bearings of the roads , the difference of soil , the state of the harvest , the cottages , the cattle , the children , she found entertainment that could only have been heightened by having Edmund to speak to of what she felt . That was the only point of resemblance between her and the lady who sat by her : in everything but a value for Edmund , Miss Crawford was very unlike her . She had none of Fanny \u2019s delicacy of taste , of mind , of feeling ; she saw Nature , inanimate Nature , with little observation ; her attention was all for men and women , her talents for the light and lively . In looking back after Edmund , however , when there was any stretch of road behind them , or when he gained on them in ascending a considerable hill , they were united , and a \u201c there he is \u201d broke at the same moment from them both , more than once . For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort : her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by side , full of conversation and merriment ; and to see only his expressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia , or to catch the laugh of the other , was a perpetual source of irritation , which her own sense of propriety could but just smooth over . When Julia looked back , it was with a countenance of delight , and whenever she spoke to them , it was in the highest spirits : \u201c her view of the country was charming , she wished they could all see it , \u201d etc . ; but her only offer of exchange was addressed to Miss Crawford , as they gained the summit of a long hill , and was not more inviting than this : \u201c Here is a fine burst of country . I wish you had my seat , but I dare say you will not take it , let me press you ever so much ; \u201d and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they were moving again at a good pace . When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations , it was better for Miss Bertram , who might be said to have two strings to her bow . She had Rushworth feelings , and Crawford feelings , and in the vicinity of Sotherton the former had considerable effect . Mr. Rushworth \u2019s consequence was hers . She could not tell Miss Crawford that \u201c those woods belonged to Sotherton , \u201d she could not carelessly observe that \u201c she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth \u2019s property on each side of the road , \u201d without elation of heart ; and it was a pleasure to increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion , and ancient manorial residence of the family , with all its rights of court - leet and court - baron . \u201c Now we shall have no more rough road , Miss Crawford ; our difficulties are over . The rest of the way is such as it ought to be . Mr. Rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate . Here begins the village . Those cottages are really a disgrace . The church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome . I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places . The annoyance of the bells must be terrible . There is the parsonage : a tidy - looking house , and I understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people . Those are almshouses , built by some of the family . To the right is the steward \u2019s house ; he is a very respectable man . Now we are coming to the lodge - gates ; but we have nearly a mile through the park still . It is not ugly , you see , at this end ; there is some fine timber , but the situation of the house is dreadful . We go down hill to it for half a mile , and it is a pity , for it would not be an ill - looking place if it had a better approach . \u201d Miss Crawford was not slow to admire ; she pretty well guessed Miss Bertram \u2019s feelings , and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment to the utmost . Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility ; and even Fanny had something to say in admiration , and might be heard with complacency . Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach ; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house , and observing that \u201c it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , \u201d she added , \u201c Now , where is the avenue ? The house fronts the east , I perceive . The avenue , therefore , must be at the back of it . Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front . \u201d \u201c Yes , it is exactly behind the house ; begins at a little distance , and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds . You may see something of it here \u2014 something of the more distant trees . It is oak entirely . \u201d Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion ; and her spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish , when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal entrance . IX Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady ; and the whole party were welcomed by him with due attention . In the drawing - room they were met with equal cordiality by the mother , and Miss Bertram had all the distinction with each that she could wish . After the business of arriving was over , it was first necessary to eat , and the doors were thrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the appointed dining - parlour , where a collation was prepared with abundance and elegance . Much was said , and much was ate , and all went well . The particular object of the day was then considered . How would Mr. Crawford like , in what manner would he chuse , to take a survey of the grounds ? Mr. Rushworth mentioned his curricle . Mr. Crawford suggested the greater desirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two . \u201c To be depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments , might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure . \u201d Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also ; but this was scarcely received as an amendment : the young ladies neither smiled nor spoke . Her next proposition , of shewing the house to such of them as had not been there before , was more acceptable , for Miss Bertram was pleased to have its size displayed , and all were glad to be doing something . The whole party rose accordingly , and under Mrs. Rushworth \u2019s guidance were shewn through a number of rooms , all lofty , and many large , and amply furnished in the taste of fifty years back , with shining floors , solid mahogany , rich damask , marble , gilding , and carving , each handsome in its way . Of pictures there were abundance , and some few good , but the larger part were family portraits , no longer anything to anybody but Mrs. Rushworth , who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach , and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house . On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny , but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention ; for Miss Crawford , who had seen scores of great houses , and cared for none of them , had only the appearance of civilly listening , while Fanny , to whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new , attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times , its rise and grandeur , regal visits and loyal efforts , delighted to connect anything with history already known , or warm her imagination with scenes of the past . The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect from any of the rooms ; and while Fanny and some of the others were attending Mrs. Rushworth , Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head at the windows . Every room on the west front looked across a lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron palisades and gates . Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any other use than to contribute to the window - tax , and find employment for housemaids , \u201c Now , \u201d said Mrs. Rushworth , \u201c we are coming to the chapel , which properly we ought to enter from above , and look down upon ; but as we are quite among friends , I will take you in this way , if you will excuse me . \u201d They entered . Fanny \u2019s imagination had prepared her for something grander than a mere spacious , oblong room , fitted up for the purpose of devotion : with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany , and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of the family gallery above . \u201c I am disappointed , \u201d said she , in a low voice , to Edmund . \u201c This is not my idea of a chapel . There is nothing awful here , nothing melancholy , nothing grand . Here are no aisles , no arches , no inscriptions , no banners . No banners , cousin , to be \u2018 blown by the night wind of heaven . \u2019 No signs that a \u2018 Scottish monarch sleeps below . \u2019 \u201d \u201c You forget , Fanny , how lately all this has been built , and for how confined a purpose , compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries . It was only for the private use of the family . They have been buried , I suppose , in the parish church . _ There _ you must look for the banners and the achievements . \u201d \u201c It was foolish of me not to think of all that ; but I am disappointed . \u201d Mrs. Rushworth began her relation . \u201c This chapel was fitted up as you see it , in James the Second \u2019s time . Before that period , as I understand , the pews were only wainscot ; and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth ; but this is not quite certain . It is a handsome chapel , and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening . Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain , within the memory of many ; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off . \u201d \u201c Every generation has its improvements , \u201d said Miss Crawford , with a smile , to Edmund . Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford ; and Edmund , Fanny , and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together . \u201c It is a pity , \u201d cried Fanny , \u201c that the custom should have been discontinued . It was a valuable part of former times . There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house , with one \u2019s ideas of what such a household should be ! A whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine ! \u201d \u201c Very fine indeed , \u201d said Miss Crawford , laughing . \u201c It must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure , and say their prayers here twice a day , while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away . \u201d \u201c _ That _ is hardly Fanny \u2019s idea of a family assembling , \u201d said Edmund . \u201c If the master and mistress do _ not _ attend themselves , there must be more harm than good in the custom . \u201d \u201c At any rate , it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects . Everybody likes to go their own way \u2014 to chuse their own time and manner of devotion . The obligation of attendance , the formality , the restraint , the length of time \u2014 altogether it is a formidable thing , and what nobody likes ; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed , when they woke with a headache , without danger of reprobation , because chapel was missed , they would have jumped with joy and envy . Can not you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel ? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets \u2014 starched up into seeming piety , but with heads full of something very different \u2014 especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at \u2014 and , in those days , I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now . \u201d For a few moments she was unanswered . Fanny coloured and looked at Edmund , but felt too angry for speech ; and he needed a little recollection before he could say , \u201c Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects . You have given us an amusing sketch , and human nature can not say it was not so . We must all feel _ at _ _ times _ the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish ; but if you are supposing it a frequent thing , that is to say , a weakness grown into a habit from neglect , what could be expected from the _ private _ devotions of such persons ? Do you think the minds which are suffered , which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel , would be more collected in a closet ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very likely . They would have two chances at least in their favour . There would be less to distract the attention from without , and it would not be tried so long . \u201d \u201c The mind which does not struggle against itself under _ one _ circumstance , would find objects to distract it in the _ other _ , I believe ; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with . The greater length of the service , however , I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind . One wishes it were not so ; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are . \u201d While this was passing , the rest of the party being scattered about the chapel , Julia called Mr. Crawford \u2019s attention to her sister , by saying , \u201c Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria , standing side by side , exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed . Have not they completely the air of it ? \u201d Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence , and stepping forward to Maria , said , in a voice which she only could hear , \u201c I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar . \u201d Starting , the lady instinctively moved a step or two , but recovering herself in a moment , affected to laugh , and asked him , in a tone not much louder , \u201c If he would give her away ? \u201d \u201c I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly , \u201d was his reply , with a look of meaning . Julia , joining them at the moment , carried on the joke . \u201c Upon my word , it is really a pity that it should not take place directly , if we had but a proper licence , for here we are altogether , and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant . \u201d And she talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother , and expose her sister to the whispered gallantries of her lover , while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place . \u201c If Edmund were but in orders ! \u201d cried Julia , and running to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny : \u201c My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly . How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . \u201d Miss Crawford \u2019s countenance , as Julia spoke , might have amused a disinterested observer . She looked almost aghast under the new idea she was receiving . Fanny pitied her . \u201c How distressed she will be at what she said just now , \u201d passed across her mind . \u201c Ordained ! \u201d said Miss Crawford ; \u201c what , are you to be a clergyman ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; I shall take orders soon after my father \u2019s return \u2014 probably at Christmas . \u201d Miss Crawford , rallying her spirits , and recovering her complexion , replied only , \u201c If I had known this before , I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect , \u201d and turned the subject . The chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness which reigned in it , with few interruptions , throughout the year . Miss Bertram , displeased with her sister , led the way , and all seemed to feel that they had been there long enough . The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn , and Mrs. Rushworth , never weary in the cause , would have proceeded towards the principal staircase , and taken them through all the rooms above , if her son had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough . \u201c For if , \u201d said he , with the sort of self - evident proposition which many a clearer head does not always avoid , \u201c we are _ too _ long going over the house , we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors . It is past two , and we are to dine at five . \u201d Mrs. Rushworth submitted ; and the question of surveying the grounds , with the who and the how , was likely to be more fully agitated , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses most could be done , when the young people , meeting with an outward door , temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and shrubs , and all the sweets of pleasure - grounds , as by one impulse , one wish for air and liberty , all walked out . \u201c Suppose we turn down here for the present , \u201d said Mrs. Rushworth , civilly taking the hint and following them . \u201c Here are the greatest number of our plants , and here are the curious pheasants . \u201d \u201c Query , \u201d said Mr. Crawford , looking round him , \u201c whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther ? I see walls of great promise . Mr. Rushworth , shall we summon a council on this lawn ? \u201d \u201c James , \u201d said Mrs. Rushworth to her son , \u201c I believe the wilderness will be new to all the party . The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet . \u201d No objection was made , but for some time there seemed no inclination to move in any plan , or to any distance . All were attracted at first by the plants or the pheasants , and all dispersed about in happy independence . Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilities of that end of the house . The lawn , bounded on each side by a high wall , contained beyond the first planted area a bowling - green , and beyond the bowling - green a long terrace walk , backed by iron palisades , and commanding a view over them into the tops of the trees of the wilderness immediately adjoining . It was a good spot for fault - finding . Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on . The remaining three , Mrs. Rushworth , Mrs. Norris , and Julia , were still far behind ; for Julia , whose happy star no longer prevailed , was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth , and restrain her impatient feet to that lady \u2019s slow pace , while her aunt , having fallen in with the housekeeper , who was come out to feed the pheasants , was lingering behind in gossip with her . Poor Julia , the only one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot , was now in a state of complete penance , and as different from the Julia of the barouche - box as could well be imagined . The politeness which she had been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for her to escape ; while the want of that higher species of self - command , that just consideration of others , that knowledge of her own heart , that principle of right , which had not formed any essential part of her education , made her miserable under it . \u201c This is insufferably hot , \u201d said Miss Crawford , when they had taken one turn on the terrace , and were drawing a second time to the door in the middle which opened to the wilderness . \u201c Shall any of us object to being comfortable ? Here is a nice little wood , if one can but get into it . What happiness if the door should not be locked ! but of course it is ; for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like . \u201d The door , however , proved not to be locked , and they were all agreed in turning joyfully through it , and leaving the unmitigated glare of day behind . A considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness , which was a planted wood of about two acres , and though chiefly of larch and laurel , and beech cut down , and though laid out with too much regularity , was darkness and shade , and natural beauty , compared with the bowling - green and the terrace . They all felt the refreshment of it , and for some time could only walk and admire . At length , after a short pause , Miss Crawford began with , \u201c So you are to be a clergyman , Mr. Bertram . This is rather a surprise to me . \u201d \u201c Why should it surprise you ? You must suppose me designed for some profession , and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer , nor a soldier , nor a sailor . \u201d \u201c Very true ; but , in short , it had not occurred to me . And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son . \u201d \u201c A very praiseworthy practice , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c but not quite universal . I am one of the exceptions , and _ being _ one , must do something for myself . \u201d \u201c But why are you to be a clergyman ? I thought _ that _ was always the lot of the youngest , where there were many to chuse before him . \u201d \u201c Do you think the church itself never chosen , then ? \u201d \u201c _ Never _ is a black word . But yes , in the _ never _ of conversation , which means _ not _ _ very _ _ often _ , I do think it . For what is to be done in the church ? Men love to distinguish themselves , and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained , but not in the church . A clergyman is nothing . \u201d \u201c The _ nothing _ of conversation has its gradations , I hope , as well as the _ never _ . A clergyman can not be high in state or fashion . He must not head mobs , or set the ton in dress . But I can not call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind , individually or collectively considered , temporally and eternally , which has the guardianship of religion and morals , and consequently of the manners which result from their influence . No one here can call the _ office _ nothing . If the man who holds it is so , it is by the neglect of his duty , by foregoing its just importance , and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear . \u201d \u201c _ You _ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given , or than I can quite comprehend . One does not see much of this influence and importance in society , and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves ? How can two sermons a week , even supposing them worth hearing , supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair \u2019s to his own , do all that you speak of ? govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week ? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit . \u201d \u201c _ You _ are speaking of London , _ I _ am speaking of the nation at large . \u201d \u201c The metropolis , I imagine , is a pretty fair sample of the rest . \u201d \u201c Not , I should hope , of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom . We do not look in great cities for our best morality . It is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good ; and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt . A fine preacher is followed and admired ; but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood , where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character , and observing his general conduct , which in London can rarely be the case . The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners . They are known to the largest part only as preachers . And with regard to their influencing public manners , Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me , or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good - breeding , the regulators of refinement and courtesy , the masters of the ceremonies of life . The _ manners _ I speak of might rather be called _ conduct _ , perhaps , the result of good principles ; the effect , in short , of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend ; and it will , I believe , be everywhere found , that as the clergy are , or are not what they ought to be , so are the rest of the nation . \u201d \u201c Certainly , \u201d said Fanny , with gentle earnestness . \u201c There , \u201d cried Miss Crawford , \u201c you have quite convinced Miss Price already . \u201d \u201c I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too . \u201d \u201c I do not think you ever will , \u201d said she , with an arch smile ; \u201c I am just as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take orders . You really are fit for something better . Come , do change your mind . It is not too late . Go into the law . \u201d \u201c Go into the law ! With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness . \u201d \u201c Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two , but I forestall you ; remember , I have forestalled you . \u201d \u201c You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a _ bon _ _ mot _ , for there is not the least wit in my nature . I am a very matter - of - fact , plain - spoken being , and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out . \u201d A general silence succeeded . Each was thoughtful . Fanny made the first interruption by saying , \u201c I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood ; but the next time we come to a seat , if it is not disagreeable to you , I should be glad to sit down for a little while . \u201d \u201c My dear Fanny , \u201d cried Edmund , immediately drawing her arm within his , \u201c how thoughtless I have been ! I hope you are not very tired . Perhaps , \u201d turning to Miss Crawford , \u201c my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm . \u201d \u201c Thank you , but I am not at all tired . \u201d She took it , however , as she spoke , and the gratification of having her do so , of feeling such a connexion for the first time , made him a little forgetful of Fanny . \u201c You scarcely touch me , \u201d said he . \u201c You do not make me of any use . What a difference in the weight of a woman \u2019s arm from that of a man ! At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street , and you are only a fly in the comparison . \u201d \u201c I am really not tired , which I almost wonder at ; for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood . Do not you think we have ? \u201d \u201c Not half a mile , \u201d was his sturdy answer ; for he was not yet so much in love as to measure distance , or reckon time , with feminine lawlessness . \u201c Oh ! you do not consider how much we have wound about . We have taken such a very serpentine course , and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line , for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path . \u201d \u201c But if you remember , before we left that first great path , we saw directly to the end of it . We looked down the whole vista , and saw it closed by iron gates , and it could not have been more than a furlong in length . \u201d \u201c Oh ! I know nothing of your furlongs , but I am sure it is a very long wood , and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it ; and therefore , when I say that we have walked a mile in it , I must speak within compass . \u201d \u201c We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here , \u201d said Edmund , taking out his watch . \u201c Do you think we are walking four miles an hour ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! do not attack me with your watch . A watch is always too fast or too slow . I can not be dictated to by a watch . \u201d A few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk they had been talking of ; and standing back , well shaded and sheltered , and looking over a ha - ha into the park , was a comfortable - sized bench , on which they all sat down . \u201c I am afraid you are very tired , Fanny , \u201d said Edmund , observing her ; \u201c why would not you speak sooner ? This will be a bad day \u2019s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up . Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon , Miss Crawford , except riding . \u201d \u201c How abominable in you , then , to let me engross her horse as I did all last week ! I am ashamed of you and of myself , but it shall never happen again . \u201d \u201c _ Your _ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect . Fanny \u2019s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me . \u201d \u201c That she should be tired now , however , gives me no surprise ; for there is nothing in the course of one \u2019s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning : seeing a great house , dawdling from one room to another , straining one \u2019s eyes and one \u2019s attention , hearing what one does not understand , admiring what one does not care for . It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world , and Miss Price has found it so , though she did not know it . \u201d \u201c I shall soon be rested , \u201d said Fanny ; \u201c to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure , is the most perfect refreshment . \u201d After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again . \u201c I must move , \u201d said she ; \u201c resting fatigues me . I have looked across the ha - ha till I am weary . I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view , without being able to see it so well . \u201d Edmund left the seat likewise . \u201c Now , Miss Crawford , if you will look up the walk , you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long , or half half a mile . \u201d \u201c It is an immense distance , \u201d said she ; \u201c I see _ that _ with a glance . \u201d He still reasoned with her , but in vain . She would not calculate , she would not compare . She would only smile and assert . The greatest degree of rational consistency could not have been more engaging , and they talked with mutual satisfaction . At last it was agreed that they should endeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little more about it . They would go to one end of it , in the line they were then in \u2014 for there was a straight green walk along the bottom by the side of the ha - ha \u2014 and perhaps turn a little way in some other direction , if it seemed likely to assist them , and be back in a few minutes . Fanny said she was rested , and would have moved too , but this was not suffered . Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist , and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin \u2019s care , but with great regret that she was not stronger . She watched them till they had turned the corner , and listened till all sound of them had ceased .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [0, 2], "text": "VIII Fanny"}, {"position": [33, 34],
