{"document": "X A quarter of an hour , twenty minutes , passed away , and Fanny was still thinking of Edmund , Miss Crawford , and herself , without interruption from any one . She began to be surprised at being left so long , and to listen with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices again . She listened , and at length she heard ; she heard voices and feet approaching ; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted , when Miss Bertram , Mr. Rushworth , and Mr. Crawford issued from the same path which she had trod herself , and were before her . \u201c Miss Price all alone \u201d and \u201c My dear Fanny , how comes this ? \u201d were the first salutations . She told her story . \u201c Poor dear Fanny , \u201d cried her cousin , \u201c how ill you have been used by them ! You had better have staid with us . \u201d Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side , she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before , and discussed the possibility of improvements with much animation . Nothing was fixed on ; but Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects , and , generally speaking , whatever he proposed was immediately approved , first by her , and then by Mr. Rushworth , whose principal business seemed to be to hear the others , and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith \u2019s place . After some minutes spent in this way , Miss Bertram , observing the iron gate , expressed a wish of passing through it into the park , that their views and their plans might be more comprehensive . It was the very thing of all others to be wished , it was the best , it was the only way of proceeding with any advantage , in Henry Crawford \u2019s opinion ; and he directly saw a knoll not half a mile off , which would give them exactly the requisite command of the house . Go therefore they must to that knoll , and through that gate ; but the gate was locked . Mr. Rushworth wished he had brought the key ; he had been very near thinking whether he should not bring the key ; he was determined he would never come without the key again ; but still this did not remove the present evil . They could not get through ; and as Miss Bertram \u2019s inclination for so doing did by no means lessen , it ended in Mr. Rushworth \u2019s declaring outright that he would go and fetch the key . He set off accordingly . \u201c It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , \u201d said Mr. Crawford , when he was gone . \u201c Yes , there is nothing else to be done . But now , sincerely , do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected ? \u201d \u201c No , indeed , far otherwise . I find it better , grander , more complete in its style , though that style may not be the best . And to tell you the truth , \u201d speaking rather lower , \u201c I do not think that _ I _ shall ever see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now . Another summer will hardly improve it to me . \u201d After a moment \u2019s embarrassment the lady replied , \u201c You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world . If other people think Sotherton improved , I have no doubt that you will . \u201d \u201c I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points . My feelings are not quite so evanescent , nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world . \u201d This was followed by a short silence . Miss Bertram began again . \u201c You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning . I was glad to see you so well entertained . You and Julia were laughing the whole way . \u201d \u201c Were we ? Yes , I believe we were ; but I have not the least recollection at what . Oh ! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my uncle \u2019s . Your sister loves to laugh . \u201d \u201c You think her more light - hearted than I am ? \u201d \u201c More easily amused , \u201d he replied ; \u201c consequently , you know , \u201d smiling , \u201c better company . I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles \u2019 drive . \u201d \u201c Naturally , I believe , I am as lively as Julia , but I have more to think of now . \u201d \u201c You have , undoubtedly ; and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility . Your prospects , however , are too fair to justify want of spirits . You have a very smiling scene before you . \u201d \u201c Do you mean literally or figuratively ? Literally , I conclude . Yes , certainly , the sun shines , and the park looks very cheerful . But unluckily that iron gate , that ha - ha , give me a feeling of restraint and hardship . \u2018 I can not get out , \u2019 as the starling said . \u201d As she spoke , and it was with expression , she walked to the gate : he followed her . \u201c Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching this key ! \u201d \u201c And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr. Rushworth \u2019s authority and protection , or I think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate , here , with my assistance ; I think it might be done , if you really wished to be more at large , and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited . \u201d \u201c Prohibited ! nonsense ! I certainly can get out that way , and I will . Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment , you know ; we shall not be out of sight . \u201d \u201c Or if we are , Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll : the grove of oak on the knoll . \u201d Fanny , feeling all this to be wrong , could not help making an effort to prevent it . \u201c You will hurt yourself , Miss Bertram , \u201d she cried ; \u201c you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes ; you will tear your gown ; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha - ha . You had better not go . \u201d Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken , and , smiling with all the good - humour of success , she said , \u201c Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . \u201d Fanny was again left to her solitude , and with no increase of pleasant feelings , for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard , astonished at Miss Bertram , and angry with Mr. Crawford . By taking a circuitous , and , as it appeared to her , very unreasonable direction to the knoll , they were soon beyond her eye ; and for some minutes longer she remained without sight or sound of any companion . She seemed to have the little wood all to herself . She could almost have thought that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it , but that it was impossible for Edmund to forget her so entirely . She was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps : somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk . She expected Mr. Rushworth , but it was Julia , who , hot and out of breath , and with a look of disappointment , cried out on seeing her , \u201c Heyday ! Where are the others ? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you . \u201d Fanny explained . \u201c A pretty trick , upon my word ! I can not see them anywhere , \u201d looking eagerly into the park . \u201c But they can not be very far off , and I think I am equal to as much as Maria , even without help . \u201d \u201c But , Julia , Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key . Do wait for Mr. Rushworth . \u201d \u201c Not I , indeed . I have had enough of the family for one morning . Why , child , I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother . Such a penance as I have been enduring , while you were sitting here so composed and so happy ! It might have been as well , perhaps , if you had been in my place , but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes . \u201d This was a most unjust reflection , but Fanny could allow for it , and let it pass : Julia was vexed , and her temper was hasty ; but she felt that it would not last , and therefore , taking no notice , only asked her if she had not seen Mr. Rushworth . \u201c Yes , yes , we saw him . He was posting away as if upon life and death , and could but just spare time to tell us his errand , and where you all were . \u201d \u201c It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing . \u201d \u201c _ That _ is Miss Maria \u2019s concern . I am not obliged to punish myself for _ her _ sins . The mother I could not avoid , as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper , but the son I _ can _ get away from . \u201d And she immediately scrambled across the fence , and walked away , not attending to Fanny \u2019s last question of whether she had seen anything of Miss Crawford and Edmund . The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of seeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued absence , however , as she might have done . She felt that he had been very ill - used , and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had passed . He joined her within five minutes after Julia \u2019s exit ; and though she made the best of the story , he was evidently mortified and displeased in no common degree . At first he scarcely said anything ; his looks only expressed his extreme surprise and vexation , and he walked to the gate and stood there , without seeming to know what to do . \u201c They desired me to stay \u2014 my cousin Maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll , or thereabouts . \u201d \u201c I do not believe I shall go any farther , \u201d said he sullenly ; \u201c I see nothing of them . By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else . I have had walking enough . \u201d And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny . \u201c I am very sorry , \u201d said she ; \u201c it is very unlucky . \u201d And she longed to be able to say something more to the purpose . After an interval of silence , \u201c I think they might as well have staid for me , \u201d said he . \u201c Miss Bertram thought you would follow her . \u201d \u201c I should not have had to follow her if she had staid . \u201d This could not be denied , and Fanny was silenced . After another pause , he went on\u2014\u201cPray , Miss Price , are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some people are ? For my part , I can see nothing in him . \u201d \u201c I do not think him at all handsome . \u201d \u201c Handsome ! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome . He is not five foot nine . I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight . I think he is an ill - looking fellow . In my opinion , these Crawfords are no addition at all . We did very well without them . \u201d A small sigh escaped Fanny here , and she did not know how to contradict him . \u201c If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key , there might have been some excuse , but I went the very moment she said she wanted it . \u201d \u201c Nothing could be more obliging than your manner , I am sure , and I dare say you walked as fast as you could ; but still it is some distance , you know , from this spot to the house , quite into the house ; and when people are waiting , they are bad judges of time , and every half minute seems like five . \u201d He got up and walked to the gate again , and \u201c wished he had had the key about him at the time . \u201d Fanny thought she discerned in his standing there an indication of relenting , which encouraged her to another attempt , and she said , therefore , \u201c It is a pity you should not join them . They expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park , and will be thinking how it may be improved ; and nothing of that sort , you know , can be settled without you . \u201d She found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a companion . Mr. Rushworth was worked on . \u201c Well , \u201d said he , \u201c if you really think I had better go : it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing . \u201d And letting himself out , he walked off without farther ceremony . Fanny \u2019s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so long ago , and getting quite impatient , she resolved to go in search of them . She followed their steps along the bottom walk , and had just turned up into another , when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford once more caught her ear ; the sound approached , and a few more windings brought them before her . They were just returned into the wilderness from the park , to which a sidegate , not fastened , had tempted them very soon after their leaving her , and they had been across a portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last , and had been sitting down under one of the trees . This was their history . It was evident that they had been spending their time pleasantly , and were not aware of the length of their absence . Fanny \u2019s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much , and that he should certainly have come back for her , had she not been tired already ; but this was not quite sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour , when he had talked of only a few minutes , nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all that time ; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and depression , as they prepared by general agreement to return to the house . On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace , Mrs. Rushworth and Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top , just ready for the wilderness , at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the house . Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster . Whatever cross - accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces , she had found a morning of complete enjoyment ; for the housekeeper , after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants , had taken her to the dairy , told her all about their cows , and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese ; and since Julia \u2019s leaving them they had been met by the gardener , with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance , for she had set him right as to his grandson \u2019s illness , convinced him that it was an ague , and promised him a charm for it ; and he , in return , had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants , and actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath . On this _ rencontre _ they all returned to the house together , there to lounge away the time as they could with sofas , and chit - chat , and Quarterly Reviews , till the return of the others , and the arrival of dinner . It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came in , and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially agreeable , or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the object of the day . By their own accounts they had been all walking after each other , and the junction which had taken place at last seemed , to Fanny \u2019s observation , to have been as much too late for re - establishing harmony , as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration . She felt , as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth , that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them : there was gloom on the face of each . Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay , and she thought that he was taking particular pains , during dinner , to do away any little resentment of the other two , and restore general good - humour . Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee , a ten miles \u2019 drive home allowed no waste of hours ; and from the time of their sitting down to table , it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came to the door , and Mrs. Norris , having fidgeted about , and obtained a few pheasants \u2019 eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper , and made abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth , was ready to lead the way . At the same moment Mr. Crawford , approaching Julia , said , \u201c I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . \u201d The request had not been foreseen , but was very graciously received , and Julia \u2019s day was likely to end almost as well as it began . Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different , and was a little disappointed ; but her conviction of being really the one preferred comforted her under it , and enabled her to receive Mr. Rushworth \u2019s parting attentions as she ought . He was certainly better pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending the box , and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement . \u201c Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , \u201d said Mrs. Norris , as they drove through the park . \u201c Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end ! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go . A pretty good day \u2019s amusement you have had ! \u201d Maria was just discontented enough to say directly , \u201c I think _ you _ have done pretty well yourself , ma\u2019am . Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . \u201d \u201c My dear , it is only a beautiful little heath , which that nice old gardener would make me take ; but if it is in your way , I will have it in my lap directly . There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner . Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker , but my taking one of the cheeses . I stood out as long as I could , till the tears almost came into her eyes , and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with . That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure ! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table , and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns . Take care of the cheese , Fanny . Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well . \u201d \u201c What else have you been spunging ? \u201d said Maria , half - pleased that Sotherton should be so complimented . \u201c Spunging , my dear ! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants \u2019 eggs , which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me : she would not take a denial . She said it must be such an amusement to me , as she understood I lived quite alone , to have a few living creatures of that sort ; and so to be sure it will . I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen , and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop ; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them . And if I have good luck , your mother shall have some . \u201d It was a beautiful evening , mild and still , and the drive was as pleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it ; but when Mrs. Norris ceased speaking , it was altogether a silent drive to those within . Their spirits were in general exhausted ; and to determine whether the day had afforded most pleasure or pain , might occupy the meditations of almost all . XI The day at Sotherton , with all its imperfections , afforded the Miss Bertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the letters from Antigua , which soon afterwards reached Mansfield . It was much pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father ; and to think of their father in England again within a certain period , which these letters obliged them to do , was a most unwelcome exercise . November was the black month fixed for his return . Sir Thomas wrote of it with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise . His business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his passage in the September packet , and he consequently looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November . Maria was more to be pitied than Julia ; for to her the father brought a husband , and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover , on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend . It was a gloomy prospect , and all she could do was to throw a mist over it , and hope when the mist cleared away she should see something else . It would hardly be _ early _ in November , there were generally delays , a bad passage or _ something _ ; that favouring _ something _ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look , or their understandings while they reason , feels the comfort of . It would probably be the middle of November at least ; the middle of November was three months off . Three months comprised thirteen weeks . Much might happen in thirteen weeks . Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that his daughters felt on the subject of his return , and would hardly have found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the breast of another young lady . Miss Crawford , on walking up with her brother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park , heard the good news ; and though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness , and to have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation , heard it with an attention not so easily satisfied . Mrs. Norris gave the particulars of the letters , and the subject was dropt ; but after tea , as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene , while the Miss Bertrams , Mr. Rushworth , and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte , she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group , and saying , \u201c How happy Mr. Rushworth looks ! He is thinking of November . \u201d Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too , but had nothing to say . \u201c Your father \u2019s return will be a very interesting event . \u201d \u201c It will , indeed , after such an absence ; an absence not only long , but including so many dangers . \u201d \u201c It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events : your sister \u2019s marriage , and your taking orders . \u201d \u201c Yes . \u201d \u201c Do n\u2019t be affronted , \u201d said she , laughing , \u201c but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes , who , after performing great exploits in a foreign land , offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return . \u201d \u201c There is no sacrifice in the case , \u201d replied Edmund , with a serious smile , and glancing at the pianoforte again ; \u201c it is entirely her own doing . \u201d \u201c Oh yes I know it is . I was merely joking . She has done no more than what every young woman would do ; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy . My other sacrifice , of course , you do not understand . \u201d \u201c My taking orders , I assure you , is quite as voluntary as Maria \u2019s marrying . \u201d \u201c It is fortunate that your inclination and your father \u2019s convenience should accord so well . There is a very good living kept for you , I understand , hereabouts . \u201d \u201c Which you suppose has biassed me ? \u201d \u201c But _ that _ I am sure it has not , \u201d cried Fanny . \u201c Thank you for your good word , Fanny , but it is more than I would affirm myself . On the contrary , the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me . Nor can I think it wrong that it should . There was no natural disinclination to be overcome , and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life . I was in safe hands . I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way , and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it . I have no doubt that I was biased , but I think it was blamelessly . \u201d \u201c It is the same sort of thing , \u201d said Fanny , after a short pause , \u201c as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy , or the son of a general to be in the army , and nobody sees anything wrong in that . Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best , or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear . \u201d \u201c No , my dear Miss Price , and for reasons good . The profession , either navy or army , is its own justification . It has everything in its favour : heroism , danger , bustle , fashion . Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society . Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors . \u201d \u201c But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected , you think ? \u201d said Edmund . \u201c To be justified in your eyes , he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision . \u201d \u201c What ! take orders without a living ! No ; that is madness indeed ; absolute madness . \u201d \u201c Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ? No ; for you certainly would not know what to say . But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument . As he can not be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession , as heroism , and noise , and fashion , are all against him , he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his . \u201d \u201c Oh ! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made , to the trouble of working for one ; and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat , drink , and grow fat . It is indolence , Mr. Bertram , indeed . Indolence and love of ease ; a want of all laudable ambition , of taste for good company , or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable , which make men clergymen . A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish \u2014 read the newspaper , watch the weather , and quarrel with his wife . His curate does all the work , and the business of his own life is to dine . \u201d \u201c There are such clergymen , no doubt , but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character . I suspect that in this comprehensive and ( may I say ) commonplace censure , you are not judging from yourself , but from prejudiced persons , whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing . It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy . You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively . You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle \u2019s table . \u201d \u201c I speak what appears to me the general opinion ; and where an opinion is general , it is usually correct . Though _ I _ have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen , it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information . \u201d \u201c Where any one body of educated men , of whatever denomination , are condemned indiscriminately , there must be a deficiency of information , or ( smiling ) of something else . Your uncle , and his brother admirals , perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom , good or bad , they were always wishing away . \u201d \u201c Poor William ! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp , \u201d was a tender apostrophe of Fanny \u2019s , very much to the purpose of her own feelings if not of the conversation . \u201c I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , \u201d said Miss Crawford , \u201c that I can hardly suppose \u2014 and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant . And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , _ I _ see him to be an indolent , selfish _ bon _ _ vivant _ , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife . To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of . My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it . \u201d \u201c I do not wonder at your disapprobation , upon my word . It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self - indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours . Fanny , it goes against us . We can not attempt to defend Dr. Grant . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d replied Fanny , \u201c but we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a \u2014 not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman . Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation \u2014 where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the _ frequency _ , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now . A man \u2014 a sensible man like Dr. Grant , can not be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week , can not go to church twice every Sunday , and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does , without being the better for it himself . It must make him think ; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman . \u201d \u201c We can not prove to the contrary , to be sure ; but I wish you a better fate , Miss Price , than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons ; for though he may preach himself into a good - humour every Sunday , it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night . \u201d \u201c I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny , \u201d said Edmund affectionately , \u201c must be beyond the reach of any sermons . \u201d Fanny turned farther into the window ; and Miss Crawford had only time to say , in a pleasant manner , \u201c I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it \u201d ; when , being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee , she tripped off to the instrument , leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues , from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread . \u201c There goes good - humour , I am sure , \u201d said he presently . \u201c There goes a temper which would never give pain ! How well she walks ! and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others ! joining them the moment she is asked . What a pity , \u201d he added , after an instant \u2019s reflection , \u201c that she should have been in such hands ! \u201d Fanny agreed to it , and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the window with her , in spite of the expected glee ; and of having his eyes soon turned , like hers , towards the scene without , where all that was solemn , and soothing , and lovely , appeared in the brilliancy of an unclouded night , and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods . Fanny spoke her feelings . \u201c Here \u2019s harmony ! \u201d said she ; \u201c here \u2019s repose ! Here \u2019s what may leave all painting and all music behind , and what poetry only can attempt to describe ! Here \u2019s what may tranquillise every care , and lift the heart to rapture ! When I look out on such a night as this , I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world ; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to , and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene . \u201d \u201c I like to hear your enthusiasm , Fanny . It is a lovely night , and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel , in some degree , as you do ; who have not , at least , been given a taste for Nature in early life . They lose a great deal . \u201d \u201c _ You _ taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . \u201d \u201c I had a very apt scholar . There \u2019s Arcturus looking very bright . \u201d \u201c Yes , and the Bear . I wish I could see Cassiopeia . \u201d \u201c We must go out on the lawn for that . Should you be afraid ? \u201d \u201c Not in the least . It is a great while since we have had any star - gazing . \u201d \u201c Yes ; I do not know how it has happened . \u201d The glee began . \u201c We will stay till this is finished , Fanny , \u201d said he , turning his back on the window ; and as it advanced , she had the mortification of seeing him advance too , moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument , and when it ceased , he was close by the singers , among the most urgent in requesting to hear the glee again . Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris \u2019s threats of catching cold .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [14, 15], "text": "Fanny"}, {"position": [25, 26],
