{"document": "II The little girl performed her long journey in safety ; and at Northampton was met by Mrs. Norris , who thus regaled in the credit of being foremost to welcome her , and in the importance of leading her in to the others , and recommending her to their kindness . Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old , and though there might not be much in her first appearance to captivate , there was , at least , nothing to disgust her relations . She was small of her age , with no glow of complexion , nor any other striking beauty ; exceedingly timid and shy , and shrinking from notice ; but her air , though awkward , was not vulgar , her voice was sweet , and when she spoke her countenance was pretty . Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly ; and Sir Thomas , seeing how much she needed encouragement , tried to be all that was conciliating : but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment ; and Lady Bertram , without taking half so much trouble , or speaking one word where he spoke ten , by the mere aid of a good - humoured smile , became immediately the less awful character of the two . The young people were all at home , and sustained their share in the introduction very well , with much good humour , and no embarrassment , at least on the part of the sons , who , at seventeen and sixteen , and tall of their age , had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little cousin . The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in greater awe of their father , who addressed them on the occasion with rather an injudicious particularity . But they were too much used to company and praise to have anything like natural shyness ; and their confidence increasing from their cousin \u2019s total want of it , they were soon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy indifference . They were a remarkably fine family , the sons very well - looking , the daughters decidedly handsome , and all of them well - grown and forward of their age , which produced as striking a difference between the cousins in person , as education had given to their address ; and no one would have supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were . There were in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny . Julia Bertram was only twelve , and Maria but a year older . The little visitor meanwhile was as unhappy as possible . Afraid of everybody , ashamed of herself , and longing for the home she had left , she knew not how to look up , and could scarcely speak to be heard , or without crying . Mrs. Norris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her wonderful good fortune , and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behaviour which it ought to produce , and her consciousness of misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her not to be happy . The fatigue , too , of so long a journey , became soon no trifling evil . In vain were the well - meant condescensions of Sir Thomas , and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl ; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug , and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort ; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her , and sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend , she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed . \u201c This is not a very promising beginning , \u201d said Mrs. Norris , when Fanny had left the room . \u201c After all that I said to her as we came along , I thought she would have behaved better ; I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first . I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper \u2014 her poor mother had a good deal ; but we must make allowances for such a child \u2014 and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her , for , with all its faults , it _ was _ her home , and she can not as yet understand how much she has changed for the better ; but then there is moderation in all things . \u201d It required a longer time , however , than Mrs. Norris was inclined to allow , to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park , and the separation from everybody she had been used to . Her feelings were very acute , and too little understood to be properly attended to . Nobody meant to be unkind , but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure her comfort . The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day , on purpose to afford leisure for getting acquainted with , and entertaining their young cousin , produced little union . They could not but hold her cheap on finding that she had but two sashes , and had never learned French ; and when they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were so good as to play , they could do no more than make her a generous present of some of their least valued toys , and leave her to herself , while they adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport of the moment , making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper . Fanny , whether near or from her cousins , whether in the schoolroom , the drawing - room , or the shrubbery , was equally forlorn , finding something to fear in every person and place . She was disheartened by Lady Bertram \u2019s silence , awed by Sir Thomas \u2019s grave looks , and quite overcome by Mrs. Norris \u2019s admonitions . Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size , and abashed her by noticing her shyness : Miss Lee wondered at her ignorance , and the maid - servants sneered at her clothes ; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers and sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow , instructress , and nurse , the despondence that sunk her little heart was severe . The grandeur of the house astonished , but could not console her . The rooms were too large for her to move in with ease : whatever she touched she expected to injure , and she crept about in constant terror of something or other ; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry ; and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing - room when she left it at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune , ended every day \u2019s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep . A week had passed in this way , and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner , when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund , the youngest of the sons , sitting crying on the attic stairs . \u201c My dear little cousin , \u201d said he , with all the gentleness of an excellent nature , \u201c what can be the matter ? \u201d And sitting down by her , he was at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised , and persuade her to speak openly . Was she ill ? or was anybody angry with her ? or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia ? or was she puzzled about anything in her lesson that he could explain ? Did she , in short , want anything he could possibly get her , or do for her ? For a long while no answer could be obtained beyond a \u201c no , no \u2014 not at all \u2014 no , thank you \u201d ; but he still persevered ; and no sooner had he begun to revert to her own home , than her increased sobs explained to him where the grievance lay . He tried to console her . \u201c You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , \u201d said he , \u201c which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . Let us walk out in the park , and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters . \u201d On pursuing the subject , he found that , dear as all these brothers and sisters generally were , there was one among them who ran more in her thoughts than the rest . It was William whom she talked of most , and wanted most to see . William , the eldest , a year older than herself , her constant companion and friend ; her advocate with her mother ( of whom he was the darling ) in every distress . \u201c William did not like she should come away ; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed . \u201d \u201c But William will write to you , I dare say . \u201d \u201c Yes , he had promised he would , but he had told _ her _ to write first . \u201d \u201c And when shall you do it ? \u201d She hung her head and answered hesitatingly , \u201c she did not know ; she had not any paper . \u201d \u201c If that be all your difficulty , I will furnish you with paper and every other material , and you may write your letter whenever you choose . Would it make you happy to write to William ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very . \u201d \u201c Then let it be done now . Come with me into the breakfast - room , we shall find everything there , and be sure of having the room to ourselves . \u201d \u201c But , cousin , will it go to the post ? \u201d \u201c Yes , depend upon me it shall : it shall go with the other letters ; and , as your uncle will frank it , it will cost William nothing . \u201d \u201c My uncle ! \u201d repeated Fanny , with a frightened look . \u201c Yes , when you have written the letter , I will take it to my father to frank . \u201d Fanny thought it a bold measure , but offered no further resistance ; and they went together into the breakfast - room , where Edmund prepared her paper , and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could himself have felt , and probably with somewhat more exactness . He continued with her the whole time of her writing , to assist her with his penknife or his orthography , as either were wanted ; and added to these attentions , which she felt very much , a kindness to her brother which delighted her beyond all the rest . He wrote with his own hand his love to his cousin William , and sent him half a guinea under the seal . Fanny \u2019s feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing ; but her countenance and a few artless words fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight , and her cousin began to find her an interesting object . He talked to her more , and , from all that she said , was convinced of her having an affectionate heart , and a strong desire of doing right ; and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation , and great timidity . He had never knowingly given her pain , but he now felt that she required more positive kindness ; and with that view endeavoured , in the first place , to lessen her fears of them all , and gave her especially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and Julia , and being as merry as possible . From this day Fanny grew more comfortable . She felt that she had a friend , and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits with everybody else . The place became less strange , and the people less formidable ; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not cease to fear , she began at least to know their ways , and to catch the best manner of conforming to them . The little rusticities and awkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all , and not least of herself , necessarily wore away , and she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle , nor did her aunt Norris \u2019s voice make her start very much . To her cousins she became occasionally an acceptable companion . Though unworthy , from inferiority of age and strength , to be their constant associate , their pleasures and schemes were sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful , especially when that third was of an obliging , yielding temper ; and they could not but own , when their aunt inquired into her faults , or their brother Edmund urged her claims to their kindness , that \u201c Fanny was good - natured enough . \u201d Edmund was uniformly kind himself ; and she had nothing worse to endure on the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten . He was just entering into life , full of spirits , and with all the liberal dispositions of an eldest son , who feels born only for expense and enjoyment . His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his situation and rights : he made her some very pretty presents , and laughed at her . As her appearance and spirits improved , Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan ; and it was pretty soon decided between them that , though far from clever , she showed a tractable disposition , and seemed likely to give them little trouble . A mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _ them _ . Fanny could read , work , and write , but she had been taught nothing more ; and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar , they thought her prodigiously stupid , and for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawing - room . \u201c Dear mama , only think , my cousin can not put the map of Europe together \u2014 or my cousin can not tell the principal rivers in Russia \u2014 or , she never heard of Asia Minor \u2014 or she does not know the difference between water - colours and crayons!\u2014How strange!\u2014Did you ever hear anything so stupid ? \u201d \u201c My dear , \u201d their considerate aunt would reply , \u201c it is very bad , but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself . \u201d \u201c But , aunt , she is really so very ignorant!\u2014Do you know , we asked her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland ; and she said , she should cross to the Isle of Wight . She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight , and she calls it _ the _ _ Island _ , as if there were no other island in the world . I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself , if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is . I can not remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet . How long ago it is , aunt , since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England , with the dates of their accession , and most of the principal events of their reigns ! \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d added the other ; \u201c and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus ; besides a great deal of the heathen mythology , and all the metals , semi - metals , planets , and distinguished philosophers . \u201d \u201c Very true indeed , my dears , but you are blessed with wonderful memories , and your poor cousin has probably none at all . There is a vast deal of difference in memories , as well as in everything else , and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin , and pity her deficiency . And remember that , if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves , you should always be modest ; for , much as you know already , there is a great deal more for you to learn . \u201d \u201c Yes , I know there is , till I am seventeen . But I must tell you another thing of Fanny , so odd and so stupid . Do you know , she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing . \u201d \u201c To be sure , my dear , that is very stupid indeed , and shows a great want of genius and emulation . But , all things considered , I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so , for , though you know ( owing to me ) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you , it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;\u2014on the contrary , it is much more desirable that there should be a difference . \u201d Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her nieces \u2019 minds ; and it is not very wonderful that , with all their promising talents and early information , they should be entirely deficient in the less common acquirements of self - knowledge , generosity and humility . In everything but disposition they were admirably taught . Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting , because , though a truly anxious father , he was not outwardly affectionate , and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him . To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest attention . She had not time for such cares . She was a woman who spent her days in sitting , nicely dressed , on a sofa , doing some long piece of needlework , of little use and no beauty , thinking more of her pug than her children , but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to inconvenience , guided in everything important by Sir Thomas , and in smaller concerns by her sister . Had she possessed greater leisure for the service of her girls , she would probably have supposed it unnecessary , for they were under the care of a governess , with proper masters , and could want nothing more . As for Fanny \u2019s being stupid at learning , \u201c she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people _ were _ stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . \u201d Fanny , with all her faults of ignorance and timidity , was fixed at Mansfield Park , and learning to transfer in its favour much of her attachment to her former home , grew up there not unhappily among her cousins . There was no positive ill - nature in Maria or Julia ; and though Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her , she thought too lowly of her own claims to feel injured by it . From about the time of her entering the family , Lady Bertram , in consequence of a little ill - health , and a great deal of indolence , gave up the house in town , which she had been used to occupy every spring , and remained wholly in the country , leaving Sir Thomas to attend his duty in Parliament , with whatever increase or diminution of comfort might arise from her absence . In the country , therefore , the Miss Bertrams continued to exercise their memories , practise their duets , and grow tall and womanly : and their father saw them becoming in person , manner , and accomplishments , everything that could satisfy his anxiety . His eldest son was careless and extravagant , and had already given him much uneasiness ; but his other children promised him nothing but good . His daughters , he felt , while they retained the name of Bertram , must be giving it new grace , and in quitting it , he trusted , would extend its respectable alliances ; and the character of Edmund , his strong good sense and uprightness of mind , bid most fairly for utility , honour , and happiness to himself and all his connexions . He was to be a clergyman . Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested , Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs. Price : he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit ; and Fanny , though almost totally separated from her family , was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them , or of anything at all promising in their situation or conduct . Once , and once only , in the course of many years , had she the happiness of being with William . Of the rest she saw nothing : nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again , even for a visit , nobody at home seemed to want her ; but William determining , soon after her removal , to be a sailor , was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshire before he went to sea . Their eager affection in meeting , their exquisite delight in being together , their hours of happy mirth , and moments of serious conference , may be imagined ; as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even to the last , and the misery of the girl when he left her . Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas holidays , when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin Edmund ; and he told her such charming things of what William was to do , and be hereafter , in consequence of his profession , as made her gradually admit that the separation might have some use . Edmund \u2019s friendship never failed her : his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind dispositions , and only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them . Without any display of doing more than the rest , or any fear of doing too much , he was always true to her interests , and considerate of her feelings , trying to make her good qualities understood , and to conquer the diffidence which prevented their being more apparent ; giving her advice , consolation , and encouragement . Kept back as she was by everybody else , his single support could not bring her forward ; but his attentions were otherwise of the highest importance in assisting the improvement of her mind , and extending its pleasures . He knew her to be clever , to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense , and a fondness for reading , which , properly directed , must be an education in itself . Miss Lee taught her French , and heard her read the daily portion of history ; but he recommended the books which charmed her leisure hours , he encouraged her taste , and corrected her judgment : he made reading useful by talking to her of what she read , and heightened its attraction by judicious praise . In return for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world except William : her heart was divided between the two . III The first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr. Norris , which happened when Fanny was about fifteen , and necessarily introduced alterations and novelties . Mrs. Norris , on quitting the Parsonage , removed first to the Park , and afterwards to a small house of Sir Thomas \u2019s in the village , and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him ; and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy . The living was hereafter for Edmund ; and , had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders . But Tom \u2019s extravagance had , previous to that event , been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation necessary , and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder . There was another family living actually held for Edmund ; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas \u2019s conscience , he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice , and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction , in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do . \u201c I blush for you , Tom , \u201d said he , in his most dignified manner ; \u201c I blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion . You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his . It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . \u201d Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow ; but escaping as quickly as possible , could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect , firstly , that he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends ; secondly , that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it ; and , thirdly , that the future incumbent , whoever he might be , would , in all probability , die very soon . On Mr. Norris \u2019s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant , who came consequently to reside at Mansfield ; and on proving to be a hearty man of forty - five , seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram \u2019s calculations . But \u201c no , he was a short - necked , apoplectic sort of fellow , and , plied well with good things , would soon pop off . \u201d He had a wife about fifteen years his junior , but no children ; and they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very respectable , agreeable people . The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister - in - law to claim her share in their niece , the change in Mrs. Norris \u2019s situation , and the improvement in Fanny \u2019s age , seeming not merely to do away any former objection to their living together , but even to give it the most decided eligibility ; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than heretofore , by some recent losses on his West India estate , in addition to his eldest son \u2019s extravagance , it became not undesirable to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support , and the obligation of her future provision . In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be , he mentioned its probability to his wife ; and the first time of the subject \u2019s occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present , she calmly observed to her , \u201c So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . How shall you like it ? \u201d Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt \u2019s words , \u201c Going to leave you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , my dear ; why should you be astonished ? You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died . But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same . \u201d The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected . She had never received kindness from her aunt Norris , and could not love her . \u201c I shall be very sorry to go away , \u201d said she , with a faltering voice . \u201c Yes , I dare say you will ; _ that \u2019s _ natural enough . I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world . \u201d \u201c I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , \u201d said Fanny modestly . \u201c No , my dear ; I hope not . I have always found you a very good girl . \u201d \u201c And am I never to live here again ? \u201d \u201c Never , my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home . It can make very little difference to you , whether you are in one house or the other . \u201d Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart ; she could not feel the difference to be so small , she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction . As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress . \u201c Cousin , \u201d said she , \u201c something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now . I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! \u201d \u201c Yes ; my aunt Bertram has just told me so . It is quite settled . I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there . \u201d \u201c Well , Fanny , and if the plan were not unpleasant to you , I should call it an excellent one . \u201d \u201c Oh , cousin ! \u201d \u201c It has everything else in its favour . My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you . She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere . You will be what you ought to be to her . I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? \u201d \u201c Indeed it does : I can not like it . I love this house and everything in it : I shall love nothing there . You know how uncomfortable I feel with her . \u201d \u201c I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so . She never knew how to be pleasant to children . But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her . \u201d \u201c I can never be important to any one . \u201d \u201c What is to prevent you ? \u201d \u201c Everything . My situation , my foolishness and awkwardness . \u201d \u201c As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly . There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known . You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it . I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion . \u201d \u201c You are too kind , \u201d said Fanny , colouring at such praise ; \u201c how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . Oh ! cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . \u201d \u201c Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House . You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park ; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever . The two families will be meeting every day in the year . The only difference will be that , living with your aunt , you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be . _ Here _ there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with _ her _ you will be forced to speak for yourself . \u201d \u201c Oh ! do not say so . \u201d \u201c I must say it , and say it with pleasure . Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now . She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . \u201d Fanny sighed , and said , \u201c I can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself , and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be . If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me , it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody . _ Here _ , I know , I am of none , and yet I love the place so well . \u201d \u201c The place , Fanny , is what you will not quit , though you quit the house . You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever . Even _ your _ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change . You will have the same walks to frequent , the same library to choose from , the same people to look at , the same horse to ride . \u201d \u201c Very true . Yes , dear old grey pony ! Ah ! cousin , when I remember how much I used to dread riding , what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good ( oh ! how I have trembled at my uncle \u2019s opening his lips if horses were talked of ) , and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears , and convince me that I should like it after a little while , and feel how right you proved to be , I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well . \u201d \u201c And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too . \u201d So ended their discourse , which , for any very appropriate service it could render Fanny , might as well have been spared , for Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her . It had never occurred to her , on the present occasion , but as a thing to be carefully avoided . To prevent its being expected , she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish , the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her servants , and allow a spare room for a friend , of which she made a very particular point . The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been wanted , but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now never forgotten . Not all her precautions , however , could save her from being suspected of something better ; or , perhaps , her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny . Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris \u2014 \u201c I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . \u201d Mrs. Norris almost started . \u201c Live with me , dear Lady Bertram ! what do you mean ? \u201d \u201c Is she not to live with you ? I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas . \u201d \u201c Me ! never . I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me . Fanny live with me ! the last thing in the world for me to think of , or for anybody to wish that really knows us both . Good heaven ! what could I do with Fanny ? Me ! a poor , helpless , forlorn widow , unfit for anything , my spirits quite broke down ; what could I do with a girl at her time of life ? A girl of fifteen ! the very age of all others to need most attention and care , and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test ! Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing ! Sir Thomas is too much my friend . Nobody that wishes me well , I am sure , would propose it . How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it ? \u201d \u201c Indeed , I do not know . I suppose he thought it best . \u201d \u201c But what did he say ? He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny . I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it . \u201d \u201c No ; he only said he thought it very likely ; and I thought so too . We both thought it would be a comfort to you . But if you do not like it , there is no more to be said . She is no encumbrance here . \u201d \u201c Dear sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ? Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed \u2014 what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ? If I could wish it for my own sake , I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl . She is in good hands , and sure of doing well . I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can . \u201d \u201c Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone ? \u201d \u201c Lady Bertram , I do not complain . I know I can not live as I have done , but I must retrench where I can , and learn to be a better manager . I _ have _ _ been _ a liberal housekeeper enough , but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now . My situation is as much altered as my income . A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris , as clergyman of the parish , that can not be expected from me . It is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers . At the White House , matters must be better looked after . I _ must _ live within my income , or I shall be miserable ; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more , to lay by a little at the end of the year . \u201d \u201c I dare say you will . You always do , do n\u2019t you ? \u201d \u201c My object , Lady Bertram , is to be of use to those that come after me . It is for your children \u2019s good that I wish to be richer . I have nobody else to care for , but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having . \u201d \u201c You are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them . They are sure of being well provided for . Sir Thomas will take care of that . \u201d \u201c Why , you know , Sir Thomas \u2019s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns . \u201d \u201c Oh ! _ that _ will soon be settled . Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know . \u201d \u201c Well , Lady Bertram , \u201d said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , \u201c I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ; besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend . \u201d Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken his sister - in - law \u2019s views ; and she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation , or the slightest allusion to it from him . He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her . Mrs. Norris took possession of the White House , the Grants arrived at the Parsonage , and these events over , everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual . The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable , gave great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance . They had their faults , and Mrs. Norris soon found them out . The Doctor was very fond of eating , and would have a good dinner every day ; and Mrs. Grant , instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense , gave her cook as high wages as they did at Mansfield Park , and was scarcely ever seen in her offices . Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances , nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed in the house . \u201c Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself ; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in _ her _ _ time _ , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand . A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place . _ Her _ store - room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into . Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds . \u201d Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective . She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist , but she felt all the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant \u2019s being so well settled in life without being handsome , and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often , though not so diffusely , as Mrs. Norris discussed the other . These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies . Sir Thomas found it expedient to go to Antigua himself , for the better arrangement of his affairs , and he took his eldest son with him , in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions at home . They left England with the probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent . The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light , and the hope of its utility to his son , reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the rest of his family , and of leaving his daughters to the direction of others at their present most interesting time of life . He could not think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them , or rather , to perform what should have been her own ; but , in Mrs. Norris \u2019s watchful attention , and in Edmund \u2019s judgment , he had sufficient confidence to make him go without fears for their conduct . Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her ; but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety , or solicitude for his comfort , being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous , or difficult , or fatiguing to anybody but themselves . The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion : not for their sorrow , but for their want of it . Their father was no object of love to them ; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures , and his absence was unhappily most welcome . They were relieved by it from all restraint ; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been forbidden by Sir Thomas , they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal , and to have every indulgence within their reach . Fanny \u2019s relief , and her consciousness of it , were quite equal to her cousins \u2019 ; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful , and she really grieved because she could not grieve . \u201c Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear ! it was a shameful insensibility . \u201d He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . \u201c This was so thoughtful and kind ! \u201d and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her \u201c my dear Fanny , \u201d while he said it , every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten . But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , \u201c If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . \u201d She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone ; and her cousins , on seeing her with red eyes , set her down as a hypocrite .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 4],
