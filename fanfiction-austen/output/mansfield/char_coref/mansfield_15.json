{"document": "XXX Miss Crawford \u2019s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation , and she walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another week of the same small party in the same bad weather , had they been put to the proof ; but as that very evening brought her brother down from London again in quite , or more than quite , his usual cheerfulness , she had nothing farther to try her own . His still refusing to tell her what he had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety ; a day before it might have irritated , but now it was a pleasant joke \u2014 suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself . And the next day _ did _ bring a surprise to her . Henry had said he should just go and ask the Bertrams how they did , and be back in ten minutes , but he was gone above an hour ; and when his sister , who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden , met him at last most impatiently in the sweep , and cried out , \u201c My dear Henry , where can you have been all this time ? \u201d he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady Bertram and Fanny . \u201c Sitting with them an hour and a half ! \u201d exclaimed Mary . But this was only the beginning of her surprise . \u201c Yes , Mary , \u201d said he , drawing her arm within his , and walking along the sweep as if not knowing where he was : \u201c I could not get away sooner ; Fanny looked so lovely ! I am quite determined , Mary . My mind is entirely made up . Will it astonish you ? No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . \u201d The surprise was now complete ; for , in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest , a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister \u2019s imagination ; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt , that he was obliged to repeat what he had said , and more fully and more solemnly . The conviction of his determination once admitted , it was not unwelcome . There was even pleasure with the surprise . Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family , and to be not displeased with her brother \u2019s marrying a little beneath him . \u201c Yes , Mary , \u201d was Henry \u2019s concluding assurance . \u201c I am fairly caught . You know with what idle designs I began ; but this is the end of them . I have , I flatter myself , made no inconsiderable progress in her affections ; but my own are entirely fixed . \u201d \u201c Lucky , lucky girl ! \u201d cried Mary , as soon as she could speak ; \u201c what a match for her ! My dearest Henry , this must be my _ first _ feeling ; but my _ second _ , which you shall have as sincerely , is , that I approve your choice from my soul , and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it . You will have a sweet little wife ; all gratitude and devotion . Exactly what you deserve . What an amazing match for her ! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck ; what will she say now ? The delight of all the family , indeed ! And she has some _ true _ friends in it ! How _ they _ will rejoice ! But tell me all about it ! Talk to me for ever . When did you begin to think seriously about her ? \u201d Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question , though nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked . \u201c How the pleasing plague had stolen on him \u201d he could not say ; and before he had expressed the same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over , his sister eagerly interrupted him with , \u201c Ah , my dear Henry , and this is what took you to London ! This was your business ! You chose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind . \u201d But this he stoutly denied . He knew his uncle too well to consult him on any matrimonial scheme . The Admiral hated marriage , and thought it never pardonable in a young man of independent fortune . \u201c When Fanny is known to him , \u201d continued Henry , \u201c he will doat on her . She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral , for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world . She is the very impossibility he would describe , if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas . But till it is absolutely settled \u2014 settled beyond all interference , he shall know nothing of the matter . No , Mary , you are quite mistaken . You have not discovered my business yet . \u201d \u201c Well , well , I am satisfied . I know now to whom it must relate , and am in no hurry for the rest . Fanny Price ! wonderful , quite wonderful ! That Mansfield should have done so much for \u2014 that _ you _ should have found your fate in Mansfield ! But you are quite right ; you could not have chosen better . There is not a better girl in the world , and you do not want for fortune ; and as to her connexions , they are more than good . The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country . She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram ; that will be enough for the world . But go on , go on . Tell me more . What are your plans ? Does she know her own happiness ? \u201d \u201c No . \u201d \u201c What are you waiting for ? \u201d \u201c For \u2014 for very little more than opportunity . Mary , she is not like her cousins ; but I think I shall not ask in vain . \u201d \u201c Oh no ! you can not . Were you even less pleasing \u2014 supposing her not to love you already ( of which , however , I can have little doubt)\u2014you would be safe . The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately . From my soul I do not think she would marry you _ without _ love ; that is , if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition , I can suppose it her ; but ask her to love you , and she will never have the heart to refuse . \u201d As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence , he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen ; and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself , though he had in fact nothing to relate but his own sensations , nothing to dwell on but Fanny \u2019s charms . Fanny \u2019s beauty of face and figure , Fanny \u2019s graces of manner and goodness of heart , were the exhaustless theme . The gentleness , modesty , and sweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on ; that sweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman \u2019s worth in the judgment of man , that though he sometimes loves where it is not , he can never believe it absent . Her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise . He had often seen it tried . Was there one of the family , excepting Edmund , who had not in some way or other continually exercised her patience and forbearance ? Her affections were evidently strong . To see her with her brother ! What could more delightfully prove that the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness ? What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love in view ? Then , her understanding was beyond every suspicion , quick and clear ; and her manners were the mirror of her own modest and elegant mind . Nor was this all . Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles in a wife , though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection to know them by their proper name ; but when he talked of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct , such a high notion of honour , and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity , he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well principled and religious . \u201c I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her , \u201d said he ; \u201c and _ that _ is what I want . \u201d Well might his sister , believing as she really did that his opinion of Fanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits , rejoice in her prospects . \u201c The more I think of it , \u201d she cried , \u201c the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy . Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed . You will both find your good in it . \u201d \u201c It was bad , very bad in me against such a creature ; but I did not know her then ; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head . I will make her very happy , Mary ; happier than she has ever yet been herself , or ever seen anybody else . I will not take her from Northamptonshire . I shall let Everingham , and rent a place in this neighbourhood ; perhaps Stanwix Lodge . I shall let a seven years \u2019 lease of Everingham . I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word . I could name three people now , who would give me my own terms and thank me . \u201d \u201c Ha ! \u201d cried Mary ; \u201c settle in Northamptonshire ! That is pleasant ! Then we shall be all together . \u201d When she had spoken it , she recollected herself , and wished it unsaid ; but there was no need of confusion ; for her brother saw her only as the supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage , and replied but to invite her in the kindest manner to his own house , and to claim the best right in her . \u201c You must give us more than half your time , \u201d said he . \u201c I can not admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself , for we shall both have a right in you . Fanny will be so truly your sister ! \u201d Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances ; but she was now very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sister many months longer . \u201c You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire ? \u201d \u201c Yes . \u201d \u201c That \u2019s right ; and in London , of course , a house of your own : no longer with the Admiral . My dearest Henry , the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his , before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions , or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life ! _ You _ are not sensible of the gain , for your regard for him has blinded you ; but , in my estimation , your marrying early may be the saving of you . To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed , look or gesture , would have broken my heart . \u201d \u201c Well , well , we do not think quite alike here . The Admiral has his faults , but he is a very good man , and has been more than a father to me . Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much . You must not prejudice Fanny against him . I must have them love one another . \u201d Mary refrained from saying what she felt , that there could not be two persons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant : time would discover it to him ; but she could not help _ this _ reflection on the Admiral . \u201c Henry , I think so highly of Fanny Price , that if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill - used aunt had to abhor the very name , I would prevent the marriage , if possible ; but I know you : I know that a wife you _ loved _ would be the happiest of women , and that even when you ceased to love , she would yet find in you the liberality and good - breeding of a gentleman . \u201d The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny Price happy , or of ceasing to love Fanny Price , was of course the groundwork of his eloquent answer . \u201c Had you seen her this morning , Mary , \u201d he continued , \u201c attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt \u2019s stupidity , working with her , and for her , her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work , then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman \u2019s service , and all this with such unpretending gentleness , so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command , her hair arranged as neatly as it always is , and one little curl falling forward as she wrote , which she now and then shook back , and in the midst of all this , still speaking at intervals to _ me _ , or listening , and as if she liked to listen , to what I said . Had you seen her so , Mary , you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing . \u201d \u201c My dearest Henry , \u201d cried Mary , stopping short , and smiling in his face , \u201c how glad I am to see you so much in love ! It quite delights me . But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say ? \u201d \u201c I care neither what they say nor what they feel . They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me , that can attach a man of sense . I wish the discovery may do them any good . And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be , and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness . They will be angry , \u201d he added , after a moment \u2019s silence , and in a cooler tone ; \u201c Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry . It will be a bitter pill to her ; that is , like other bitter pills , it will have two moments \u2019 ill flavour , and then be swallowed and forgotten ; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women \u2019s , though _ I _ was the object of them . Yes , Mary , my Fanny will feel a difference indeed : a daily , hourly difference , in the behaviour of every being who approaches her ; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it , that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due . Now she is dependent , helpless , friendless , neglected , forgotten . \u201d \u201c Nay , Henry , not by all ; not forgotten by all ; not friendless or forgotten . Her cousin Edmund never forgets her . \u201d \u201c Edmund ! True , I believe he is , generally speaking , kind to her , and so is Sir Thomas in his way ; but it is the way of a rich , superior , long - worded , arbitrary uncle . What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do , what _ do _ they do for her happiness , comfort , honour , and dignity in the world , to what I _ shall _ do ? \u201d XXXI Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning , and at an earlier hour than common visiting warrants . The two ladies were together in the breakfast - room , and , fortunately for him , Lady Bertram was on the very point of quitting it as he entered . She was almost at the door , and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain , she still went on , after a civil reception , a short sentence about being waited for , and a \u201c Let Sir Thomas know \u201d to the servant . Henry , overjoyed to have her go , bowed and watched her off , and without losing another moment , turned instantly to Fanny , and , taking out some letters , said , with a most animated look , \u201c I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring . He is made . Your brother is a lieutenant . I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother \u2019s promotion . Here are the letters which announce it , this moment come to hand . You will , perhaps , like to see them . \u201d Fanny could not speak , but he did not want her to speak . To see the expression of her eyes , the change of her complexion , the progress of her feelings , their doubt , confusion , and felicity , was enough . She took the letters as he gave them . The first was from the Admiral to inform his nephew , in a few words , of his having succeeded in the object he had undertaken , the promotion of young Price , and enclosing two more , one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend , whom the Admiral had set to work in the business , the other from that friend to himself , by which it appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles ; that Sir Charles was much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his regard for Admiral Crawford , and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price \u2019s commission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made out was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people . While her hand was trembling under these letters , her eye running from one to the other , and her heart swelling with emotion , Crawford thus continued , with unfeigned eagerness , to express his interest in the event \u2014 \u201c I will not talk of my own happiness , \u201d said he , \u201c great as it is , for I think only of yours . Compared with you , who has a right to be happy ? I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world . I have not lost a moment , however . The post was late this morning , but there has not been since a moment \u2019s delay . How impatient , how anxious , how wild I have been on the subject , I will not attempt to describe ; how severely mortified , how cruelly disappointed , in not having it finished while I was in London ! I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it , for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from Mansfield . But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire , and exerted himself immediately , there were difficulties from the absence of one friend , and the engagements of another , which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of , and knowing in what good hands I left the cause , I came away on Monday , trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by such very letters as these . My uncle , who is the very best man in the world , has exerted himself , as I knew he would , after seeing your brother . He was delighted with him . I would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted , or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his praise . I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend , as this day _ does _ prove it . _ Now _ I may say that even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest , or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation , than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together . \u201d \u201c Has this been all _ your _ doing , then ? \u201d cried Fanny . \u201c Good heaven ! how very , very kind ! Have you really \u2014 was it by _ your _ desire ? I beg your pardon , but I am bewildered . Did Admiral Crawford apply ? How was it ? I am stupefied . \u201d Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible , by beginning at an earlier stage , and explaining very particularly what he had done . His last journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that of introducing her brother in Hill Street , and prevailing on the Admiral to exert whatever interest he might have for getting him on . This had been his business . He had communicated it to no creature : he had not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary ; while uncertain of the issue , he could not have borne any participation of his feelings , but this had been his business ; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been , and used such strong expressions , was so abounding in the _ deepest _ _ interest _ , in _ twofold _ _ motives _ , in _ views _ _ and _ _ wishes _ _ more _ _ than _ _ could _ _ be _ _ told _ , that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift , had she been able to attend ; but her heart was so full and her senses still so astonished , that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her of William , and saying only when he paused , \u201c How kind ! how very kind ! Oh , Mr. Crawford , we are infinitely obliged to you ! Dearest , dearest William ! \u201d She jumped up and moved in haste towards the door , crying out , \u201c I will go to my uncle . My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible . \u201d But this could not be suffered . The opportunity was too fair , and his feelings too impatient . He was after her immediately . \u201c She must not go , she must allow him five minutes longer , \u201d and he took her hand and led her back to her seat , and was in the middle of his farther explanation , before she had suspected for what she was detained . When she did understand it , however , and found herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart had never known before , and that everything he had done for William was to be placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled attachment to her , she was exceedingly distressed , and for some moments unable to speak . She considered it all as nonsense , as mere trifling and gallantry , which meant only to deceive for the hour ; she could not but feel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily , and in such a way as she had not deserved ; but it was like himself , and entirely of a piece with what she had seen before ; and she would not allow herself to shew half the displeasure she felt , because he had been conferring an obligation , which no want of delicacy on his part could make a trifle to her . While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude on William \u2019s behalf , she could not be severely resentful of anything that injured only herself ; and after having twice drawn back her hand , and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him , she got up , and said only , with much agitation , \u201c Do n\u2019t , Mr. Crawford , pray do n\u2019t ! I beg you would not . This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me . I must go away . I can not bear it . \u201d But he was still talking on , describing his affection , soliciting a return , and , finally , in words so plain as to bear but one meaning even to her , offering himself , hand , fortune , everything , to her acceptance . It was so ; he had said it . Her astonishment and confusion increased ; and though still not knowing how to suppose him serious , she could hardly stand . He pressed for an answer . \u201c No , no , no ! \u201d she cried , hiding her face . \u201c This is all nonsense . Do not distress me . I can hear no more of this . Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express ; but I do not want , I can not bear , I must not listen to such \u2014 No , no , do n\u2019t think of me . But you are _ not _ thinking of me . I know it is all nothing . \u201d She had burst away from him , and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard speaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in . It was no time for farther assurances or entreaty , though to part with her at a moment when her modesty alone seemed , to his sanguine and preassured mind , to stand in the way of the happiness he sought , was a cruel necessity . She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle was approaching , and was walking up and down the East room in the utmost confusion of contrary feeling , before Sir Thomas \u2019s politeness or apologies were over , or he had reached the beginning of the joyful intelligence which his visitor came to communicate . She was feeling , thinking , trembling about everything ; agitated , happy , miserable , infinitely obliged , absolutely angry . It was all beyond belief ! He was inexcusable , incomprehensible ! But such were his habits that he could do nothing without a mixture of evil . He had previously made her the happiest of human beings , and now he had insulted \u2014 she knew not what to say , how to class , or how to regard it . She would not have him be serious , and yet what could excuse the use of such words and offers , if they meant but to trifle ? But William was a lieutenant . _ That _ was a fact beyond a doubt , and without an alloy . She would think of it for ever and forget all the rest . Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again : he must have seen how unwelcome it was to her ; and in that case , how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship to William ! She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great staircase , till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford \u2019s having left the house ; but when convinced of his being gone , she was eager to go down and be with her uncle , and have all the happiness of his joy as well as her own , and all the benefit of his information or his conjectures as to what would now be William \u2019s destination . Sir Thomas was as joyful as she could desire , and very kind and communicative ; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her , till she found , towards the close , that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day . This was a most unwelcome hearing , for though he might think nothing of what had passed , it would be quite distressing to her to see him again so soon . She tried to get the better of it ; tried very hard , as the dinner hour approached , to feel and appear as usual ; but it was quite impossible for her not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor entered the room . She could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrence of circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on the first day of hearing of William \u2019s promotion . Mr. Crawford was not only in the room \u2014 he was soon close to her . He had a note to deliver from his sister . Fanny could not look at him , but there was no consciousness of past folly in his voice . She opened her note immediately , glad to have anything to do , and happy , as she read it , to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris , who was also to dine there , screened her a little from view . \u201c MY DEAR FANNY,\u2014for so I may now always call you , to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _ Miss _ _ Price _ for at least the last six weeks \u2014 I can not let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation , and giving my most joyful consent and approval . Go on , my dear Fanny , and without fear ; there can be no difficulties worth naming . I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something ; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles this afternoon , and send him back to me even happier than he goes . Yours affectionately , M. C. \u201d These were not expressions to do Fanny any good ; for though she read in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford \u2019s meaning , it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother \u2019s attachment , and even to _ appear _ to believe it serious . She did not know what to do , or what to think . There was wretchedness in the idea of its being serious ; there was perplexity and agitation every way . She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her , and he spoke to her much too often ; and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked to the others . Her comfort in that day \u2019s dinner was quite destroyed : she could hardly eat anything ; and when Sir Thomas good - humouredly observed that joy had taken away her appetite , she was ready to sink with shame , from the dread of Mr. Crawford \u2019s interpretation ; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand , where he sat , she felt that _ his _ were immediately directed towards her . She was more silent than ever . She would hardly join even when William was the subject , for his commission came all from the right hand too , and there was pain in the connexion . She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever , and began to be in despair of ever getting away ; but at last they were in the drawing - room , and she was able to think as she would , while her aunts finished the subject of William \u2019s appointment in their own style . Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to Sir Thomas as with any part of it . \u201c _ Now _ William would be able to keep himself , which would make a vast difference to his uncle , for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle ; and , indeed , it would make some difference in _ her _ presents too . She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting , very glad , indeed , that it had been in her power , without material inconvenience , just at that time to give him something rather considerable ; that is , for _ her _ , with _ her _ limited means , for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin . She knew he must be at some expense , that he would have many things to buy , though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap ; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it . \u201d \u201c I am glad you gave him something considerable , \u201d said Lady Bertram , with most unsuspicious calmness , \u201c for _ I _ gave him only \u00a3 10 . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! \u201d cried Mrs. Norris , reddening . \u201c Upon my word , he must have gone off with his pockets well lined , and at no expense for his journey to London either ! \u201d \u201c Sir Thomas told me \u00a3 10 would be enough . \u201d Mrs. Norris , being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency , began to take the matter in another point . \u201c It is amazing , \u201d said she , \u201c how much young people cost their friends , what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world ! They little think how much it comes to , or what their parents , or their uncles and aunts , pay for them in the course of the year . Now , here are my sister Price \u2019s children ; take them all together , I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year , to say nothing of what _ I _ do for them . \u201d \u201c Very true , sister , as you say . But , poor things ! they can not help it ; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas . Fanny , William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies ; and I shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having . I wish he may go to the East Indies , that I may have my shawl . I think I will have two shawls , Fanny . \u201d Fanny , meanwhile , speaking only when she could not help it , was very earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at . There was everything in the world _ against _ their being serious but his words and manner . Everything natural , probable , reasonable , was against it ; all their habits and ways of thinking , and all her own demerits . How could _ she _ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so many , and been admired by so many , and flirted with so many , infinitely her superiors ; who seemed so little open to serious impressions , even where pains had been taken to please him ; who thought so slightly , so carelessly , so unfeelingly on all such points ; who was everything to everybody , and seemed to find no one essential to him ? And farther , how could it be supposed that his sister , with all her high and worldly notions of matrimony , would be forwarding anything of a serious nature in such a quarter ? Nothing could be more unnatural in either . Fanny was ashamed of her own doubts . Everything might be possible rather than serious attachment , or serious approbation of it toward her . She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them . The difficulty was in maintaining the conviction quite so absolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room ; for once or twice a look seemed forced on her which she did not know how to class among the common meaning ; in any other man , at least , she would have said that it meant something very earnest , very pointed . But she still tried to believe it no more than what he might often have expressed towards her cousins and fifty other women . She thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard by the rest . She fancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals , whenever Sir Thomas was out of the room , or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris , and she carefully refused him every opportunity . At last \u2014 it seemed an at last to Fanny \u2019s nervousness , though not remarkably late \u2014 he began to talk of going away ; but the comfort of the sound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment , and saying , \u201c Have you nothing to send to Mary ? No answer to her note ? She will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you . Pray write to her , if it be only a line . \u201d \u201c Oh yes ! certainly , \u201d cried Fanny , rising in haste , the haste of embarrassment and of wanting to get away\u2014\u201cI will write directly . \u201d She went accordingly to the table , where she was in the habit of writing for her aunt , and prepared her materials without knowing what in the world to say . She had read Miss Crawford \u2019s note only once , and how to reply to anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing . Quite unpractised in such sort of note - writing , had there been time for scruples and fears as to style she would have felt them in abundance : but something must be instantly written ; and with only one decided feeling , that of wishing not to appear to think anything really intended , she wrote thus , in great trembling both of spirits and hand \u2014 \u201c I am very much obliged to you , my dear Miss Crawford , for your kind congratulations , as far as they relate to my dearest William . The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice . I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently . I do not know what I write , but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again . With thanks for the honour of your note , I remain , dear Miss Crawford , & c. , & c. \u201d The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright , for she found that Mr. Crawford , under pretence of receiving the note , was coming towards her . \u201c You can not think I mean to hurry you , \u201d said he , in an undervoice , perceiving the amazing trepidation with which she made up the note , \u201c you can not think I have any such object . Do not hurry yourself , I entreat . \u201d \u201c Oh ! I thank you ; I have quite done , just done ; it will be ready in a moment ; I am very much obliged to you ; if you will be so good as to give _ that _ to Miss Crawford . \u201d The note was held out , and must be taken ; and as she instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace , where sat the others , he had nothing to do but to go in good earnest . Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation , both of pain and pleasure ; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die with the day ; for every day would restore the knowledge of William \u2019s advancement , whereas the pain , she hoped , would return no more . She had no doubt that her note must appear excessively ill - written , that the language would disgrace a child , for her distress had allowed no arrangement ; but at least it would assure them both of her being neither imposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford \u2019s attentions .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Miss Crawford"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "she"},
