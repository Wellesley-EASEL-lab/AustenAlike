{"document": "XXVI William \u2019s desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary impression on his uncle . The hope of an opportunity , which Sir Thomas had then given , was not given to be thought of no more . He remained steadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling ; to gratify anybody else who might wish to see Fanny dance , and to give pleasure to the young people in general ; and having thought the matter over , and taken his resolution in quiet independence , the result of it appeared the next morning at breakfast , when , after recalling and commending what his nephew had said , he added , \u201c I do not like , William , that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence . It would give me pleasure to see you both dance . You spoke of the balls at Northampton . Your cousins have occasionally attended them ; but they would not altogether suit us now . The fatigue would be too much for your aunt . I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball . A dance at home would be more eligible ; and if \u2014 \u201d \u201c Ah , my dear Sir Thomas ! \u201d interrupted Mrs. Norris , \u201c I knew what was coming . I knew what you were going to say . If dear Julia were at home , or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton , to afford a reason , an occasion for such a thing , you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield . I know you would . If _ they _ were at home to grace the ball , a ball you would have this very Christmas . Thank your uncle , William , thank your uncle ! \u201d \u201c My daughters , \u201d replied Sir Thomas , gravely interposing , \u201c have their pleasures at Brighton , and I hope are very happy ; but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins . Could we be all assembled , our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete , but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement . \u201d Mrs. Norris had not another word to say . She saw decision in his looks , and her surprise and vexation required some minutes \u2019 silence to be settled into composure . A ball at such a time ! His daughters absent and herself not consulted ! There was comfort , however , soon at hand . _ She _ must be the doer of everything : Lady Bertram would of course be spared all thought and exertion , and it would all fall upon _ her _ . She should have to do the honours of the evening ; and this reflection quickly restored so much of her good - humour as enabled her to join in with the others , before their happiness and thanks were all expressed . Edmund , William , and Fanny did , in their different ways , look and speak as much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could desire . Edmund \u2019s feelings were for the other two . His father had never conferred a favour or shewn a kindness more to his satisfaction . Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented , and had no objections to make . Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little trouble ; and she assured him \u201c that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . \u201d Mrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he would think fittest to be used , but found it all prearranged ; and when she would have conjectured and hinted about the day , it appeared that the day was settled too . Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a very complete outline of the business ; and as soon as she would listen quietly , could read his list of the families to be invited , from whom he calculated , with all necessary allowance for the shortness of the notice , to collect young people enough to form twelve or fourteen couple : and could detail the considerations which had induced him to fix on the 22nd as the most eligible day . William was required to be at Portsmouth on the 24th ; the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his visit ; but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any earlier . Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the same , and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself , as by far the best day for the purpose . The ball was now a settled thing , and before the evening a proclaimed thing to all whom it concerned . Invitations were sent with despatch , and many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of happy cares as well as Fanny . To her the cares were sometimes almost beyond the happiness ; for young and inexperienced , with small means of choice and no confidence in her own taste , the \u201c how she should be dressed \u201d was a point of painful solicitude ; and the almost solitary ornament in her possession , a very pretty amber cross which William had brought her from Sicily , was the greatest distress of all , for she had nothing but a bit of ribbon to fasten it to ; and though she had worn it in that manner once , would it be allowable at such a time in the midst of all the rich ornaments which she supposed all the other young ladies would appear in ? And yet not to wear it ! William had wanted to buy her a gold chain too , but the purchase had been beyond his means , and therefore not to wear the cross might be mortifying him . These were anxious considerations ; enough to sober her spirits even under the prospect of a ball given principally for her gratification . The preparations meanwhile went on , and Lady Bertram continued to sit on her sofa without any inconvenience from them . She had some extra visits from the housekeeper , and her maid was rather hurried in making up a new dress for her : Sir Thomas gave orders , and Mrs. Norris ran about ; but all this gave _ her _ no trouble , and as she had foreseen , \u201c there was , in fact , no trouble in the business . \u201d Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares : his mind being deeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at hand , which were to fix his fate in life \u2014 ordination and matrimony \u2014 events of such a serious character as to make the ball , which would be very quickly followed by one of them , appear of less moment in his eyes than in those of any other person in the house . On the 23rd he was going to a friend near Peterborough , in the same situation as himself , and they were to receive ordination in the course of the Christmas week . Half his destiny would then be determined , but the other half might not be so very smoothly wooed . His duties would be established , but the wife who was to share , and animate , and reward those duties , might yet be unattainable . He knew his own mind , but he was not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford \u2019s . There were points on which they did not quite agree ; there were moments in which she did not seem propitious ; and though trusting altogether to her affection , so far as to be resolved \u2014 almost resolved \u2014 on bringing it to a decision within a very short time , as soon as the variety of business before him were arranged , and he knew what he had to offer her , he had many anxious feelings , many doubting hours as to the result . His conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong ; he could look back on a long course of encouragement , and she was as perfect in disinterested attachment as in everything else . But at other times doubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes ; and when he thought of her acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement , her decided preference of a London life , what could he expect but a determined rejection ? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated , demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as conscience must forbid . The issue of all depended on one question . Did she love him well enough to forego what had used to be essential points ? Did she love him well enough to make them no longer essential ? And this question , which he was continually repeating to himself , though oftenest answered with a \u201c Yes , \u201d had sometimes its \u201c No . \u201d Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield , and on this circumstance the \u201c no \u201d and the \u201c yes \u201d had been very recently in alternation . He had seen her eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend \u2019s letter , which claimed a long visit from her in London , and of the kindness of Henry , in engaging to remain where he was till January , that he might convey her thither ; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey with an animation which had \u201c no \u201d in every tone . But this had occurred on the first day of its being settled , within the first hour of the burst of such enjoyment , when nothing but the friends she was to visit was before her . He had since heard her express herself differently , with other feelings , more chequered feelings : he had heard her tell Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret ; that she began to believe neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were worth those she left behind ; and that though she felt she must go , and knew she should enjoy herself when once away , she was already looking forward to being at Mansfield again . Was there not a \u201c yes \u201d in all this ? With such matters to ponder over , and arrange , and re - arrange , Edmund could not , on his own account , think very much of the evening which the rest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of strong interest . Independent of his two cousins \u2019 enjoyment in it , the evening was to him of no higher value than any other appointed meeting of the two families might be . In every meeting there was a hope of receiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford \u2019s attachment ; but the whirl of a ballroom , perhaps , was not particularly favourable to the excitement or expression of serious feelings . To engage her early for the two first dances was all the command of individual happiness which he felt in his power , and the only preparation for the ball which he could enter into , in spite of all that was passing around him on the subject , from morning till night . Thursday was the day of the ball ; and on Wednesday morning Fanny , still unable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear , determined to seek the counsel of the more enlightened , and apply to Mrs. Grant and her sister , whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless ; and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton , and she had reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out , she walked down to the Parsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion ; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to Fanny , being more than half - ashamed of her own solicitude . She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage , just setting out to call on her , and as it seemed to her that her friend , though obliged to insist on turning back , was unwilling to lose her walk , she explained her business at once , and observed , that if she would be so kind as to give her opinion , it might be all talked over as well without doors as within . Miss Crawford appeared gratified by the application , and after a moment \u2019s thought , urged Fanny \u2019s returning with her in a much more cordial manner than before , and proposed their going up into her room , where they might have a comfortable coze , without disturbing Dr. and Mrs. Grant , who were together in the drawing - room . It was just the plan to suit Fanny ; and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready and kind attention , they proceeded indoors , and upstairs , and were soon deep in the interesting subject . Miss Crawford , pleased with the appeal , gave her all her best judgment and taste , made everything easy by her suggestions , and tried to make everything agreeable by her encouragement . The dress being settled in all its grander parts\u2014\u201cBut what shall you have by way of necklace ? \u201d said Miss Crawford . \u201c Shall not you wear your brother \u2019s cross ? \u201d And as she spoke she was undoing a small parcel , which Fanny had observed in her hand when they met . Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on this point : she did not know how either to wear the cross , or to refrain from wearing it . She was answered by having a small trinket - box placed before her , and being requested to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces . Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford was provided , and such the object of her intended visit : and in the kindest manner she now urged Fanny \u2019s taking one for the cross and to keep for her sake , saying everything she could think of to obviate the scruples which were making Fanny start back at first with a look of horror at the proposal . \u201c You see what a collection I have , \u201d said she ; \u201c more by half than I ever use or think of . I do not offer them as new . I offer nothing but an old necklace . You must forgive the liberty , and oblige me . \u201d Fanny still resisted , and from her heart . The gift was too valuable . But Miss Crawford persevered , and argued the case with so much affectionate earnestness through all the heads of William and the cross , and the ball , and herself , as to be finally successful . Fanny found herself obliged to yield , that she might not be accused of pride or indifference , or some other littleness ; and having with modest reluctance given her consent , proceeded to make the selection . She looked and looked , longing to know which might be least valuable ; and was determined in her choice at last , by fancying there was one necklace more frequently placed before her eyes than the rest . It was of gold , prettily worked ; and though Fanny would have preferred a longer and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose , she hoped , in fixing on this , to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep . Miss Crawford smiled her perfect approbation ; and hastened to complete the gift by putting the necklace round her , and making her see how well it looked . Fanny had not a word to say against its becomingness , and , excepting what remained of her scruples , was exceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos . She would rather , perhaps , have been obliged to some other person . But this was an unworthy feeling . Miss Crawford had anticipated her wants with a kindness which proved her a real friend . \u201c When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you , \u201d said she , \u201c and feel how very kind you were . \u201d \u201c You must think of somebody else too , when you wear that necklace , \u201d replied Miss Crawford . \u201c You must think of Henry , for it was his choice in the first place . He gave it to me , and with the necklace I make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver . It is to be a family remembrancer . The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too . \u201d Fanny , in great astonishment and confusion , would have returned the present instantly . To take what had been the gift of another person , of a brother too , impossible ! it must not be ! and with an eagerness and embarrassment quite diverting to her companion , she laid down the necklace again on its cotton , and seemed resolved either to take another or none at all . Miss Crawford thought she had never seen a prettier consciousness . \u201c My dear child , \u201d said she , laughing , \u201c what are you afraid of ? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine , and fancy you did not come honestly by it ? or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago , before he knew there was such a throat in the world ? or perhaps\u201d\u2014looking archly\u2014\u201cyou suspect a confederacy between us , and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire ? \u201d With the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought . \u201c Well , then , \u201d replied Miss Crawford more seriously , but without at all believing her , \u201c to convince me that you suspect no trick , and are as unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you , take the necklace and say no more about it . Its being a gift of my brother \u2019s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it , as I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it . He is always giving me something or other . I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half . And as for this necklace , I do not suppose I have worn it six times : it is very pretty , but I never think of it ; and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket - box , you have happened to fix on the very one which , if I have a choice , I would rather part with and see in your possession than any other . Say no more against it , I entreat you . Such a trifle is not worth half so many words . \u201d Fanny dared not make any farther opposition ; and with renewed but less happy thanks accepted the necklace again , for there was an expression in Miss Crawford \u2019s eyes which she could not be satisfied with . It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford \u2019s change of manners . She had long seen it . He evidently tried to please her : he was gallant , he was attentive , he was something like what he had been to her cousins : he wanted , she supposed , to cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them ; and whether he might not have some concern in this necklace \u2014 she could not be convinced that he had not , for Miss Crawford , complaisant as a sister , was careless as a woman and a friend . Reflecting and doubting , and feeling that the possession of what she had so much wished for did not bring much satisfaction , she now walked home again , with a change rather than a diminution of cares since her treading that path before . XXVII On reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this unexpected acquisition , this doubtful good of a necklace , in some favourite box in the East room , which held all her smaller treasures ; but on opening the door , what was her surprise to find her cousin Edmund there writing at the table ! Such a sight having never occurred before , was almost as wonderful as it was welcome . \u201c Fanny , \u201d said he directly , leaving his seat and his pen , and meeting her with something in his hand , \u201c I beg your pardon for being here . I came to look for you , and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in , was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand . You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle \u2014 a chain for William \u2019s cross . You ought to have had it a week ago , but there has been a delay from my brother \u2019s not being in town by several days so soon as I expected ; and I have only just now received it at Northampton . I hope you will like the chain itself , Fanny . I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste ; but , at any rate , I know you will be kind to my intentions , and consider it , as it really is , a token of the love of one of your oldest friends . \u201d And so saying , he was hurrying away , before Fanny , overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure , could attempt to speak ; but quickened by one sovereign wish , she then called out , \u201c Oh ! cousin , stop a moment , pray stop ! \u201d He turned back . \u201c I can not attempt to thank you , \u201d she continued , in a very agitated manner ; \u201c thanks are out of the question . I feel much more than I can possibly express . Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond \u2014 \u201d \u201c If that is all you have to say , Fanny \u201d smiling and turning away again . \u201c No , no , it is not . I want to consult you . \u201d Almost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he had just put into her hand , and seeing before her , in all the niceness of jewellers \u2019 packing , a plain gold chain , perfectly simple and neat , she could not help bursting forth again , \u201c Oh , this is beautiful indeed ! This is the very thing , precisely what I wished for ! This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess . It will exactly suit my cross . They must and shall be worn together . It comes , too , in such an acceptable moment . Oh , cousin , you do not know how acceptable it is . \u201d \u201c My dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much . I am most happy that you like the chain , and that it should be here in time for to - morrow ; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion . Believe me , I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours . No , I can safely say , I have no pleasure so complete , so unalloyed . It is without a drawback . \u201d Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour without saying another word ; but Edmund , after waiting a moment , obliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying , \u201c But what is it that you want to consult me about ? \u201d It was about the necklace , which she was now most earnestly longing to return , and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing . She gave the history of her recent visit , and now her raptures might well be over ; for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance , so delighted with what Miss Crawford had done , so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between them , that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind , though it might have its drawback . It was some time before she could get his attention to her plan , or any answer to her demand of his opinion : he was in a reverie of fond reflection , uttering only now and then a few half - sentences of praise ; but when he did awake and understand , he was very decided in opposing what she wished . \u201c Return the necklace ! No , my dear Fanny , upon no account . It would be mortifying her severely . There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend . Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of ? \u201d \u201c If it had been given to me in the first instance , \u201d said Fanny , \u201c I should not have thought of returning it ; but being her brother \u2019s present , is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it , when it is not wanted ? \u201d \u201c She must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother \u2019s gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it . No doubt it is handsomer than mine , and fitter for a ballroom . \u201d \u201c No , it is not handsomer , not at all handsomer in its way , and , for my purpose , not half so fit . The chain will agree with William \u2019s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace . \u201d \u201c For one night , Fanny , for only one night , if it _ be _ a sacrifice ; I am sure you will , upon consideration , make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort . Miss Crawford \u2019s attentions to you have been \u2014 not more than you were justly entitled to \u2014 I am the last person to think that _ could _ _ be _ , but they have been invariable ; and to be returning them with what must have something the _ air _ of ingratitude , though I know it could never have the _ meaning _ , is not in your nature , I am sure . Wear the necklace , as you are engaged to do , to - morrow evening , and let the chain , which was not ordered with any reference to the ball , be kept for commoner occasions . This is my advice . I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure , and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences , resulting principally from situation , no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship . I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise , \u201d he repeated , his voice sinking a little , \u201c between the two dearest objects I have on earth . \u201d He was gone as he spoke ; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as she could . She was one of his two dearest \u2014 that must support her . But the other : the first ! She had never heard him speak so openly before , and though it told her no more than what she had long perceived , it was a stab , for it told of his own convictions and views . They were decided . He would marry Miss Crawford . It was a stab , in spite of every long - standing expectation ; and she was obliged to repeat again and again , that she was one of his two dearest , before the words gave her any sensation . Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him , it would be \u2014 oh , how different would it be \u2014 how far more tolerable ! But he was deceived in her : he gave her merits which she had not ; her faults were what they had ever been , but he saw them no longer . Till she had shed many tears over this deception , Fanny could not subdue her agitation ; and the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the influence of fervent prayers for his happiness . It was her intention , as she felt it to be her duty , to try to overcome all that was excessive , all that bordered on selfishness , in her affection for Edmund . To call or to fancy it a loss , a disappointment , would be a presumption for which she had not words strong enough to satisfy her own humility . To think of him as Miss Crawford might be justified in thinking , would in her be insanity . To her he could be nothing under any circumstances ; nothing dearer than a friend . Why did such an idea occur to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden ? It ought not to have touched on the confines of her imagination . She would endeavour to be rational , and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford \u2019s character , and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart . She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self - government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , \u201c My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept \u201d locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift . It was the only thing approaching to a letter which she had ever received from him ; she might never receive another ; it was impossible that she ever should receive another so perfectly gratifying in the occasion and the style . Two lines more prized had never fallen from the pen of the most distinguished author \u2014 never more completely blessed the researches of the fondest biographer . The enthusiasm of a woman \u2019s love is even beyond the biographer \u2019s . To her , the handwriting itself , independent of anything it may convey , is a blessedness . Never were such characters cut by any other human being as Edmund \u2019s commonest handwriting gave ! This specimen , written in haste as it was , had not a fault ; and there was a felicity in the flow of the first four words , in the arrangement of \u201c My very dear Fanny , \u201d which she could have looked at for ever . Having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happy mixture of reason and weakness , she was able in due time to go down and resume her usual employments near her aunt Bertram , and pay her the usual observances without any apparent want of spirits . Thursday , predestined to hope and enjoyment , came ; and opened with more kindness to Fanny than such self - willed , unmanageable days often volunteer , for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought from Mr. Crawford to William , stating that as he found himself obliged to go to London on the morrow for a few days , he could not help trying to procure a companion ; and therefore hoped that if William could make up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed , he would accept a place in his carriage . Mr. Crawford meant to be in town by his uncle \u2019s accustomary late dinner - hour , and William was invited to dine with him at the Admiral \u2019s . The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself , who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses , and such a good - humoured , agreeable friend ; and , in likening it to going up with despatches , was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest ; and Fanny , from a different motive , was exceedingly pleased ; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night , which would not have allowed him an hour \u2019s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach ; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford \u2019s would rob her of many hours of his company , she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey , to think of anything else . Sir Thomas approved of it for another reason . His nephew \u2019s introduction to Admiral Crawford might be of service . The Admiral , he believed , had interest . Upon the whole , it was a very joyous note . Fanny \u2019s spirits lived on it half the morning , deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go away . As for the ball , so near at hand , she had too many agitations and fears to have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she ought to have had , or must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking forward to the same event in situations more at ease , but under circumstances of less novelty , less interest , less peculiar gratification , than would be attributed to her . Miss Price , known only by name to half the people invited , was now to make her first appearance , and must be regarded as the queen of the evening . Who could be happier than Miss Price ? But Miss Price had not been brought up to the trade of _ coming _ _ out _ ; and had she known in what light this ball was , in general , considered respecting her , it would very much have lessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing wrong and being looked at . To dance without much observation or any extraordinary fatigue , to have strength and partners for about half the evening , to dance a little with Edmund , and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford , to see William enjoy himself , and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris , was the height of her ambition , and seemed to comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness . As these were the best of her hopes , they could not always prevail ; and in the course of a long morning , spent principally with her two aunts , she was often under the influence of much less sanguine views . William , determined to make this last day a day of thorough enjoyment , was out snipe - shooting ; Edmund , she had too much reason to suppose , was at the Parsonage ; and left alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris , who was cross because the housekeeper would have her own way with the supper , and whom _ she _ could not avoid though the housekeeper might , Fanny was worn down at last to think everything an evil belonging to the ball , and when sent off with a parting worry to dress , moved as languidly towards her own room , and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in it . As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday ; it had been about the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage , and found Edmund in the East room . \u201c Suppose I were to find him there again to - day ! \u201d said she to herself , in a fond indulgence of fancy . \u201c Fanny , \u201d said a voice at that moment near her . Starting and looking up , she saw , across the lobby she had just reached , Edmund himself , standing at the head of a different staircase . He came towards her . \u201c You look tired and fagged , Fanny . You have been walking too far . \u201d \u201c No , I have not been out at all . \u201d \u201c Then you have had fatigues within doors , which are worse . You had better have gone out . \u201d Fanny , not liking to complain , found it easiest to make no answer ; and though he looked at her with his usual kindness , she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance . He did not appear in spirits : something unconnected with her was probably amiss . They proceeded upstairs together , their rooms being on the same floor above . \u201c I come from Dr. Grant \u2019s , \u201d said Edmund presently . \u201c You may guess my errand there , Fanny . \u201d And he looked so conscious , that Fanny could think but of one errand , which turned her too sick for speech . \u201c I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , \u201d was the explanation that followed , and brought Fanny to life again , enabling her , as she found she was expected to speak , to utter something like an inquiry as to the result . \u201c Yes , \u201d he answered , \u201c she is engaged to me ; but \u201d ( with a smile that did not sit easy ) \u201c she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me . She is not serious . I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it . She never has danced with a clergyman , she says , and she never _ will _ . For my own sake , I could wish there had been no ball just at \u2014 I mean not this very week , this very day ; to - morrow I leave home . \u201d Fanny struggled for speech , and said , \u201c I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you . This ought to be a day of pleasure . My uncle meant it so . \u201d \u201c Oh yes , yes ! and it will be a day of pleasure . It will all end right . I am only vexed for a moment . In fact , it is not that I consider the ball as ill - timed ; what does it signify ? But , Fanny , \u201d stopping her , by taking her hand , and speaking low and seriously , \u201c you know what all this means . You see how it is ; and could tell me , perhaps better than I could tell you , how and why I am vexed . Let me talk to you a little . You are a kind , kind listener . I have been pained by her manner this morning , and can not get the better of it . I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own , but the influence of her former companions makes her seem \u2014 gives to her conversation , to her professed opinions , sometimes a tinge of wrong . She does not _ think _ evil , but she speaks it , speaks it in playfulness ; and though I know it to be playfulness , it grieves me to the soul . \u201d \u201c The effect of education , \u201d said Fanny gently . Edmund could not but agree to it . \u201c Yes , that uncle and aunt ! They have injured the finest mind ; for sometimes , Fanny , I own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted . \u201d Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment , and therefore , after a moment \u2019s consideration , said , \u201c If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . Do not ask advice of _ me _ . I am not competent . \u201d \u201c You are right , Fanny , to protest against such an office , but you need not be afraid . It is a subject on which I should never ask advice ; it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked ; and few , I imagine , do ask it , but when they want to be influenced against their conscience . I only want to talk to you . \u201d \u201c One thing more . Excuse the liberty ; but take care _ how _ you talk to me . Do not tell me anything now , which hereafter you may be sorry for . The time may come \u2014 \u201d The colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke . \u201c Dearest Fanny ! \u201d cried Edmund , pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford \u2019s , \u201c you are all considerate thought ! But it is unnecessary here . The time will never come . No such time as you allude to will ever come . I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had . You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded . How many a time have we talked over her little errors ! You need not fear me ; I have almost given up every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . \u201d He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen . He had said enough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known , and with a brighter look , she answered , \u201c Yes , cousin , I am convinced that _ you _ would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not . I can not be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say . Do not check yourself . Tell me whatever you like . \u201d They were now on the second floor , and the appearance of a housemaid prevented any farther conversation . For Fanny \u2019s present comfort it was concluded , perhaps , at the happiest moment : had he been able to talk another five minutes , there is no saying that he might not have talked away all Miss Crawford \u2019s faults and his own despondence . But as it was , they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection , and with some very precious sensations on hers . She had felt nothing like it for hours . Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford \u2019s note to William had worn away , she had been in a state absolutely the reverse ; there had been no comfort around , no hope within her . Now everything was smiling . William \u2019s good fortune returned again upon her mind , and seemed of greater value than at first . The ball , too \u2014 such an evening of pleasure before her ! It was now a real animation ; and she began to dress for it with much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball . All went well : she did not dislike her own looks ; and when she came to the necklaces again , her good fortune seemed complete , for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross . She had , to oblige Edmund , resolved to wear it ; but it was too large for the purpose . His , therefore , must be worn ; and having , with delightful feelings , joined the chain and the cross \u2014 those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart , those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary \u2014 and put them round her neck , and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were , she was able , without an effort , to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford \u2019s necklace too . She acknowledged it to be right . Miss Crawford had a claim ; and when it was no longer to encroach on , to interfere with the stronger claims , the truer kindness of another , she could do her justice even with pleasure to herself . The necklace really looked very well ; and Fanny left her room at last , comfortably satisfied with herself and all about her . Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual degree of wakefulness . It had really occurred to her , unprompted , that Fanny , preparing for a ball , might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid \u2019s , and when dressed herself , she actually sent her own maid to assist her ; too late , of course , to be of any use . Mrs. Chapman had just reached the attic floor , when Miss Price came out of her room completely dressed , and only civilities were necessary ; but Fanny felt her aunt \u2019s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do themselves .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "William"}, {"position": [15, 16], "text": "his"}, {"position": [108, 110], "text": "his
