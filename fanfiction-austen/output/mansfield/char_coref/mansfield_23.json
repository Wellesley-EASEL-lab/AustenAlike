{"document": "XLVI As Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying a real disappointment , she was rather in expectation , from her knowledge of Miss Crawford \u2019s temper , of being urged again ; and though no second letter arrived for the space of a week , she had still the same feeling when it did come . On receiving it , she could instantly decide on its containing little writing , and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of haste and business . Its object was unquestionable ; and two moments were enough to start the probability of its being merely to give her notice that they should be in Portsmouth that very day , and to throw her into all the agitation of doubting what she ought to do in such a case . If two moments , however , can surround with difficulties , a third can disperse them ; and before she had opened the letter , the possibility of Mr. and Miss Crawford \u2019s having applied to her uncle and obtained his permission was giving her ease . This was the letter \u2014 \u201c A most scandalous , ill - natured rumour has just reached me , and I write , dear Fanny , to warn you against giving the least credit to it , should it spread into the country . Depend upon it , there is some mistake , and that a day or two will clear it up ; at any rate , that Henry is blameless , and in spite of a moment \u2019s _ etourderie _ , thinks of nobody but you . Say not a word of it ; hear nothing , surmise nothing , whisper nothing till I write again . I am sure it will be all hushed up , and nothing proved but Rushworth \u2019s folly . If they are gone , I would lay my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park , and Julia with them . But why would not you let us come for you ? I wish you may not repent it.\u2014Yours , etc . \u201d Fanny stood aghast . As no scandalous , ill - natured rumour had reached her , it was impossible for her to understand much of this strange letter . She could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Street and Mr. Crawford , and only conjecture that something very imprudent had just occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world , and to excite her jealousy , in Miss Crawford \u2019s apprehension , if she heard it . Miss Crawford need not be alarmed for her . She was only sorry for the parties concerned and for Mansfield , if the report should spread so far ; but she hoped it might not . If the Rushworths were gone themselves to Mansfield , as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said , it was not likely that anything unpleasant should have preceded them , or at least should make any impression . As to Mr. Crawford , she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own disposition , convince him that he was not capable of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world , and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself . It was very strange ! She had begun to think he really loved her , and to fancy his affection for her something more than common ; and his sister still said that he cared for nobody else . Yet there must have been some marked display of attentions to her cousin , there must have been some strong indiscretion , since her correspondent was not of a sort to regard a slight one . Very uncomfortable she was , and must continue , till she heard from Miss Crawford again . It was impossible to banish the letter from her thoughts , and she could not relieve herself by speaking of it to any human being . Miss Crawford need not have urged secrecy with so much warmth ; she might have trusted to her sense of what was due to her cousin . The next day came and brought no second letter . Fanny was disappointed . She could still think of little else all the morning ; but , when her father came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual , she was so far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel that the subject was for a moment out of her head . She was deep in other musing . The remembrance of her first evening in that room , of her father and his newspaper , came across her . No candle was now wanted . The sun was yet an hour and half above the horizon . She felt that she had , indeed , been three months there ; and the sun \u2019s rays falling strongly into the parlour , instead of cheering , made her still more melancholy , for sunshine appeared to her a totally different thing in a town and in the country . Here , its power was only a glare : a stifling , sickly glare , serving but to bring forward stains and dirt that might otherwise have slept . There was neither health nor gaiety in sunshine in a town . She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat , in a cloud of moving dust , and her eyes could only wander from the walls , marked by her father \u2019s head , to the table cut and notched by her brothers , where stood the tea - board never thoroughly cleaned , the cups and saucers wiped in streaks , the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin blue , and the bread and butter growing every minute more greasy than even Rebecca \u2019s hands had first produced it . Her father read his newspaper , and her mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual , while the tea was in preparation , and wished Rebecca would mend it ; and Fanny was first roused by his calling out to her , after humphing and considering over a particular paragraph : \u201c What \u2019s the name of your great cousins in town , Fan ? \u201d A moment \u2019s recollection enabled her to say , \u201c Rushworth , sir . \u201d \u201c And do n\u2019t they live in Wimpole Street ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir . \u201d \u201c Then , there \u2019s the devil to pay among them , that \u2019s all ! There \u201d ( holding out the paper to her ) ; \u201c much good may such fine relations do you . I do n\u2019t know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters ; he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less . But , by G \u2014 ! if she belonged to _ me _ , I \u2019d give her the rope \u2019s end as long as I could stand over her . A little flogging for man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things . \u201d Fanny read to herself that \u201c it was with infinite concern the newspaper had to announce to the world a matrimonial _ fracas _ in the family of Mr. R. of Wimpole Street ; the beautiful Mrs. R. , whose name had not long been enrolled in the lists of Hymen , and who had promised to become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world , having quitted her husband \u2019s roof in company with the well - known and captivating Mr. C. , the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R. , and it was not known even to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone . \u201d \u201c It is a mistake , sir , \u201d said Fanny instantly ; \u201c it must be a mistake , it can not be true ; it must mean some other people . \u201d She spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame ; she spoke with a resolution which sprung from despair , for she spoke what she did not , could not believe herself . It had been the shock of conviction as she read . The truth rushed on her ; and how she could have spoken at all , how she could even have breathed , was afterwards matter of wonder to herself . Mr. Price cared too little about the report to make her much answer . \u201c It might be all a lie , \u201d he acknowledged ; \u201c but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way , that there was no answering for anybody . \u201d \u201c Indeed , I hope it is not true , \u201d said Mrs. Price plaintively ; \u201c it would be so very shocking ! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet , I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times ; have not I , Betsey ? And it would not be ten minutes \u2019 work . \u201d The horror of a mind like Fanny \u2019s , as it received the conviction of such guilt , and began to take in some part of the misery that must ensue , can hardly be described . At first , it was a sort of stupefaction ; but every moment was quickening her perception of the horrible evil . She could not doubt , she dared not indulge a hope , of the paragraph being false . Miss Crawford \u2019s letter , which she had read so often as to make every line her own , was in frightful conformity with it . Her eager defence of her brother , her hope of its being _ hushed _ _ up _ , her evident agitation , were all of a piece with something very bad ; and if there was a woman of character in existence , who could treat as a trifle this sin of the first magnitude , who would try to gloss it over , and desire to have it unpunished , she could believe Miss Crawford to be the woman ! Now she could see her own mistake as to _ who _ were gone , or _ said _ to be gone . It was not Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth ; it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr. Crawford . Fanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before . There was no possibility of rest . The evening passed without a pause of misery , the night was totally sleepless . She passed only from feelings of sickness to shudderings of horror ; and from hot fits of fever to cold . The event was so shocking , that there were moments even when her heart revolted from it as impossible : when she thought it could not be . A woman married only six months ago ; a man professing himself devoted , even _ engaged _ to another ; that other her near relation ; the whole family , both families connected as they were by tie upon tie ; all friends , all intimate together ! It was too horrible a confusion of guilt , too gross a complication of evil , for human nature , not in a state of utter barbarism , to be capable of ! yet her judgment told her it was so . _ His _ unsettled affections , wavering with his vanity , _ Maria \u2019s _ decided attachment , and no sufficient principle on either side , gave it possibility : Miss Crawford \u2019s letter stampt it a fact . What would be the consequence ? Whom would it not injure ? Whose views might it not affect ? Whose peace would it not cut up for ever ? Miss Crawford , herself , Edmund ; but it was dangerous , perhaps , to tread such ground . She confined herself , or tried to confine herself , to the simple , indubitable family misery which must envelop all , if it were indeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure . The mother \u2019s sufferings , the father \u2019s ; there she paused . Julia \u2019s , Tom \u2019s , Edmund \u2019s ; there a yet longer pause . They were the two on whom it would fall most horribly . Sir Thomas \u2019s parental solicitude and high sense of honour and decorum , Edmund \u2019s upright principles , unsuspicious temper , and genuine strength of feeling , made her think it scarcely possible for them to support life and reason under such disgrace ; and it appeared to her that , as far as this world alone was concerned , the greatest blessing to every one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be instant annihilation . Nothing happened the next day , or the next , to weaken her terrors . Two posts came in , and brought no refutation , public or private . There was no second letter to explain away the first from Miss Crawford ; there was no intelligence from Mansfield , though it was now full time for her to hear again from her aunt . This was an evil omen . She had , indeed , scarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe her mind , and was reduced to so low and wan and trembling a condition , as no mother , not unkind , except Mrs. Price could have overlooked , when the third day did bring the sickening knock , and a letter was again put into her hands . It bore the London postmark , and came from Edmund . \u201c Dear Fanny,\u2014You know our present wretchedness . May God support you under your share ! We have been here two days , but there is nothing to be done . They can not be traced . You may not have heard of the last blow \u2014 Julia \u2019s elopement ; she is gone to Scotland with Yates . She left London a few hours before we entered it . At any other time this would have been felt dreadfully . Now it seems nothing ; yet it is an heavy aggravation . My father is not overpowered . More can not be hoped . He is still able to think and act ; and I write , by his desire , to propose your returning home . He is anxious to get you there for my mother \u2019s sake . I shall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this , and hope to find you ready to set off for Mansfield . My father wishes you to invite Susan to go with you for a few months . Settle it as you like ; say what is proper ; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his kindness at such a moment ! Do justice to his meaning , however I may confuse it . You may imagine something of my present state . There is no end of the evil let loose upon us . You will see me early by the mail.\u2014Yours , etc . \u201d Never had Fanny more wanted a cordial . Never had she felt such a one as this letter contained . To - morrow ! to leave Portsmouth to - morrow ! She was , she felt she was , in the greatest danger of being exquisitely happy , while so many were miserable . The evil which brought such good to her ! She dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it . To be going so soon , sent for so kindly , sent for as a comfort , and with leave to take Susan , was altogether such a combination of blessings as set her heart in a glow , and for a time seemed to distance every pain , and make her incapable of suitably sharing the distress even of those whose distress she thought of most . Julia \u2019s elopement could affect her comparatively but little ; she was amazed and shocked ; but it could not occupy her , could not dwell on her mind . She was obliged to call herself to think of it , and acknowledge it to be terrible and grievous , or it was escaping her , in the midst of all the agitating pressing joyful cares attending this summons to herself . There is nothing like employment , active indispensable employment , for relieving sorrow . Employment , even melancholy , may dispel melancholy , and her occupations were hopeful . She had so much to do , that not even the horrible story of Mrs. Rushworth ( now fixed to the last point of certainty ) , could affect her as it had done before . She had not time to be miserable . Within twenty - four hours she was hoping to be gone ; her father and mother must be spoken to , Susan prepared , everything got ready . Business followed business ; the day was hardly long enough . The happiness she was imparting , too , happiness very little alloyed by the black communication which must briefly precede it \u2014 the joyful consent of her father and mother to Susan \u2019s going with her \u2014 the general satisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded , and the ecstasy of Susan herself , was all serving to support her spirits . The affliction of the Bertrams was little felt in the family . Mrs. Price talked of her poor sister for a few minutes , but how to find anything to hold Susan \u2019s clothes , because Rebecca took away all the boxes and spoilt them , was much more in her thoughts : and as for Susan , now unexpectedly gratified in the first wish of her heart , and knowing nothing personally of those who had sinned , or of those who were sorrowing \u2014 if she could help rejoicing from beginning to end , it was as much as ought to be expected from human virtue at fourteen . As nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price , or the good offices of Rebecca , everything was rationally and duly accomplished , and the girls were ready for the morrow . The advantage of much sleep to prepare them for their journey was impossible . The cousin who was travelling towards them could hardly have less than visited their agitated spirits \u2014 one all happiness , the other all varying and indescribable perturbation . By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house . The girls heard his entrance from above , and Fanny went down . The idea of immediately seeing him , with the knowledge of what he must be suffering , brought back all her own first feelings . He so near her , and in misery . She was ready to sink as she entered the parlour . He was alone , and met her instantly ; and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words , just articulate , \u201c My Fanny , my only sister ; my only comfort now ! \u201d She could say nothing ; nor for some minutes could he say more . He turned away to recover himself , and when he spoke again , though his voice still faltered , his manner shewed the wish of self - command , and the resolution of avoiding any farther allusion . \u201c Have you breakfasted ? When shall you be ready ? Does Susan go ? \u201d were questions following each other rapidly . His great object was to be off as soon as possible . When Mansfield was considered , time was precious ; and the state of his own mind made him find relief only in motion . It was settled that he should order the carriage to the door in half an hour . Fanny answered for their having breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour . He had already ate , and declined staying for their meal . He would walk round the ramparts , and join them with the carriage . He was gone again ; glad to get away even from Fanny . He looked very ill ; evidently suffering under violent emotions , which he was determined to suppress . She knew it must be so , but it was terrible to her . The carriage came ; and he entered the house again at the same moment , just in time to spend a few minutes with the family , and be a witness \u2014 but that he saw nothing \u2014 of the tranquil manner in which the daughters were parted with , and just in time to prevent their sitting down to the breakfast - table , which , by dint of much unusual activity , was quite and completely ready as the carriage drove from the door . Fanny \u2019s last meal in her father \u2019s house was in character with her first : she was dismissed from it as hospitably as she had been welcomed . How her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she passed the barriers of Portsmouth , and how Susan \u2019s face wore its broadest smiles , may be easily conceived . Sitting forwards , however , and screened by her bonnet , those smiles were unseen . The journey was likely to be a silent one . Edmund \u2019s deep sighs often reached Fanny . Had he been alone with her , his heart must have opened in spite of every resolution ; but Susan \u2019s presence drove him quite into himself , and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be long supported . Fanny watched him with never - failing solicitude , and sometimes catching his eye , revived an affectionate smile , which comforted her ; but the first day \u2019s journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the subjects that were weighing him down . The next morning produced a little more . Just before their setting out from Oxford , while Susan was stationed at a window , in eager observation of the departure of a large family from the inn , the other two were standing by the fire ; and Edmund , particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny \u2019s looks , and from his ignorance of the daily evils of her father \u2019s house , attributing an undue share of the change , attributing _ all _ to the recent event , took her hand , and said in a low , but very expressive tone , \u201c No wonder \u2014 you must feel it \u2014 you must suffer . How a man who had once loved , could desert you ! But _ yours_\u2014your regard was new compared with \u2014\u2014 Fanny , think of _ me _ ! \u201d The first division of their journey occupied a long day , and brought them , almost knocked up , to Oxford ; but the second was over at a much earlier hour . They were in the environs of Mansfield long before the usual dinner - time , and as they approached the beloved place , the hearts of both sisters sank a little . Fanny began to dread the meeting with her aunts and Tom , under so dreadful a humiliation ; and Susan to feel with some anxiety , that all her best manners , all her lately acquired knowledge of what was practised here , was on the point of being called into action . Visions of good and ill breeding , of old vulgarisms and new gentilities , were before her ; and she was meditating much upon silver forks , napkins , and finger - glasses . Fanny had been everywhere awake to the difference of the country since February ; but when they entered the Park her perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest sort . It was three months , full three months , since her quitting it , and the change was from winter to summer . Her eye fell everywhere on lawns and plantations of the freshest green ; and the trees , though not fully clothed , were in that delightful state when farther beauty is known to be at hand , and when , while much is actually given to the sight , more yet remains for the imagination . Her enjoyment , however , was for herself alone . Edmund could not share it . She looked at him , but he was leaning back , sunk in a deeper gloom than ever , and with eyes closed , as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him , and the lovely scenes of home must be shut out . It made her melancholy again ; and the knowledge of what must be enduring there , invested even the house , modern , airy , and well situated as it was , with a melancholy aspect . By one of the suffering party within they were expected with such impatience as she had never known before . Fanny had scarcely passed the solemn - looking servants , when Lady Bertram came from the drawing - room to meet her ; came with no indolent step ; and falling on her neck , said , \u201c Dear Fanny ! now I shall be comfortable . \u201d XLVII It had been a miserable party , each of the three believing themselves most miserable . Mrs. Norris , however , as most attached to Maria , was really the greatest sufferer . Maria was her first favourite , the dearest of all ; the match had been her own contriving , as she had been wo nt with such pride of heart to feel and say , and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her . She was an altered creature , quieted , stupefied , indifferent to everything that passed . The being left with her sister and nephew , and all the house under her care , had been an advantage entirely thrown away ; she had been unable to direct or dictate , or even fancy herself useful . When really touched by affliction , her active powers had been all benumbed ; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her the smallest support or attempt at support . She had done no more for them than they had done for each other . They had been all solitary , helpless , and forlorn alike ; and now the arrival of the others only established her superiority in wretchedness . Her companions were relieved , but there was no good for _ her _ . Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt ; but Mrs. Norris , instead of having comfort from either , was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom , in the blindness of her anger , she could have charged as the daemon of the piece . Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened . Susan too was a grievance . She had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks , but she felt her as a spy , and an intruder , and an indigent niece , and everything most odious . By her other aunt , Susan was received with quiet kindness . Lady Bertram could not give her much time , or many words , but she felt her , as Fanny \u2019s sister , to have a claim at Mansfield , and was ready to kiss and like her ; and Susan was more than satisfied , for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill - humour was to be expected from aunt Norris ; and was so provided with happiness , so strong in that best of blessings , an escape from many certain evils , that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others . She was now left a good deal to herself , to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could , and spent her days very happily in so doing , while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up , or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them , at this time , for everything like comfort ; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother \u2019s , and Fanny devoted to her aunt Bertram , returning to every former office with more than former zeal , and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed so much to want her . To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny , talk and lament , was all Lady Bertram \u2019s consolation . To be listened to and borne with , and hear the voice of kindness and sympathy in return , was everything that could be done for her . To be otherwise comforted was out of the question . The case admitted of no comfort . Lady Bertram did not think deeply , but , guided by Sir Thomas , she thought justly on all important points ; and she saw , therefore , in all its enormity , what had happened , and neither endeavoured herself , nor required Fanny to advise her , to think little of guilt and infamy . Her affections were not acute , nor was her mind tenacious . After a time , Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects , and revive some interest in the usual occupations ; but whenever Lady Bertram _ was _ fixed on the event , she could see it only in one light , as comprehending the loss of a daughter , and a disgrace never to be wiped off . Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired . Her aunt was no very methodical narrator , but with the help of some letters to and from Sir Thomas , and what she already knew herself , and could reasonably combine , she was soon able to understand quite as much as she wished of the circumstances attending the story . Mrs. Rushworth had gone , for the Easter holidays , to Twickenham , with a family whom she had just grown intimate with : a family of lively , agreeable manners , and probably of morals and discretion to suit , for to _ their _ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times . His having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew . Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath , to pass a few days with his mother , and bring her back to town , and Maria was with these friends without any restraint , without even Julia ; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street two or three weeks before , on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas ; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates \u2019s account . Very soon after the Rushworths \u2019 return to Wimpole Street , Sir Thomas had received a letter from an old and most particular friend in London , who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter , wrote to recommend Sir Thomas \u2019s coming to London himself , and using his influence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks , and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy . Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter , without communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield , when it was followed by another , sent express from the same friend , to break to him the almost desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people . Mrs. Rushworth had left her husband \u2019s house : Mr. Rushworth had been in great anger and distress to _ him _ ( Mr. Harding ) for his advice ; Mr. Harding feared there had been _ at _ _ least _ very flagrant indiscretion . The maidservant of Mrs. Rushworth , senior , threatened alarmingly . He was doing all in his power to quiet everything , with the hope of Mrs. Rushworth \u2019s return , but was so much counteracted in Wimpole Street by the influence of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s mother , that the worst consequences might be apprehended . This dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest of the family . Sir Thomas set off , Edmund would go with him , and the others had been left in a state of wretchedness , inferior only to what followed the receipt of the next letters from London . Everything was by that time public beyond a hope . The servant of Mrs. Rushworth , the mother , had exposure in her power , and supported by her mistress , was not to be silenced . The two ladies , even in the short time they had been together , had disagreed ; and the bitterness of the elder against her daughter - in - law might perhaps arise almost as much from the personal disrespect with which she had herself been treated as from sensibility for her son . However that might be , she was unmanageable . But had she been less obstinate , or of less weight with her son , who was always guided by the last speaker , by the person who could get hold of and shut him up , the case would still have been hopeless , for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear again , and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford , who had quitted his uncle \u2019s house , as for a journey , on the very day of her absenting herself . Sir Thomas , however , remained yet a little longer in town , in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice , though all was lost on the side of character . _ His _ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of . There was but one of his children who was not at this time a source of misery to him . Tom \u2019s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister \u2019s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia \u2019s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was . His letters expressed how much he deplored it . Under any circumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance ; but to have it so clandestinely formed , and such a period chosen for its completion , placed Julia \u2019s feelings in a most unfavourable light , and severely aggravated the folly of her choice . He called it a bad thing , done in the worst manner , and at the worst time ; and though Julia was yet as more pardonable than Maria as folly than vice , he could not but regard the step she had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a conclusion hereafter like her sister \u2019s . Such was his opinion of the set into which she had thrown herself . Fanny felt for him most acutely . He could have no comfort but in Edmund . Every other child must be racking his heart . His displeasure against herself she trusted , reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris , would now be done away . _ She _ should be justified . Mr. Crawford would have fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him ; but this , though most material to herself , would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas . Her uncle \u2019s displeasure was terrible to her ; but what could her justification or her gratitude and attachment do for him ? His stay must be on Edmund alone . She was mistaken , however , in supposing that Edmund gave his father no present pain . It was of a much less poignant nature than what the others excited ; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very deeply involved in the offence of his sister and friend ; cut off by it , as he must be , from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubted attachment and strong probability of success ; and who , in everything but this despicable brother , would have been so eligible a connexion . He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs . Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle \u2019s feelings , Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss Crawford \u2019s character . Had he been privy to her conversation with his son , he would not have wished her to belong to him , though her twenty thousand pounds had been forty . That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a doubt with Fanny ; and yet , till she knew that he felt the same , her own conviction was insufficient . She thought he did , but she wanted to be assured of it . If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which had sometimes been too much for her before , it would be most consoling ; but _ that _ she found was not to be . She seldom saw him : never alone . He probably avoided being alone with her . What was to be inferred ? That his judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share of this family affliction , but that it was too keenly felt to be a subject of the slightest communication . This must be his state . He yielded , but it was with agonies which did not admit of speech . Long , long would it be ere Miss Crawford \u2019s name passed his lips again , or she could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had been . It _ was _ long . They reached Mansfield on Thursday , and it was not till Sunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject . Sitting with her on Sunday evening \u2014 a wet Sunday evening \u2014 the very time of all others when , if a friend is at hand , the heart must be opened , and everything told ; no one else in the room , except his mother , who , after hearing an affecting sermon , had cried herself to sleep , it was impossible not to speak ; and so , with the usual beginnings , hardly to be traced as to what came first , and the usual declaration that if she would listen to him for a few minutes , he should be very brief , and certainly never tax her kindness in the same way again ; she need not fear a repetition ; it would be a subject prohibited entirely : he entered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first interest to himself , to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced . How Fanny listened , with what curiosity and concern , what pain and what delight , how the agitation of his voice was watched , and how carefully her own eyes were fixed on any object but himself , may be imagined . The opening was alarming . He had seen Miss Crawford . He had been invited to see her . He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call ; and regarding it as what was meant to be the last , last interview of friendship , and investing her with all the feelings of shame and wretchedness which Crawford \u2019s sister ought to have known , he had gone to her in such a state of mind , so softened , so devoted , as made it for a few moments impossible to Fanny \u2019s fears that it should be the last . But as he proceeded in his story , these fears were over . She had met him , he said , with a serious \u2014 certainly a serious \u2014 even an agitated air ; but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence , she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him . \u201c \u2018 I heard you were in town , \u2019 said she ; \u2018 I wanted to see you . Let us talk over this sad business . What can equal the folly of our two relations ? \u2019 I could not answer , but I believe my looks spoke . She felt reproved . Sometimes how quick to feel ! With a graver look and voice she then added , \u2018 I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister \u2019s expense . \u2019 So she began , but how she went on , Fanny , is not fit , is hardly fit to be repeated to you . I can not recall all her words . I would not dwell upon them if I could . Their substance was great anger at the _ folly _ of each . She reprobated her brother \u2019s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear . Guess what I must have felt . To hear the woman whom \u2014 no harsher name than folly given ! So voluntarily , so freely , so coolly to canvass it ! No reluctance , no horror , no feminine , shall I say , no modest loathings ? This is what the world does . For where , Fanny , shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed ? Spoilt , spoilt ! \u201d After a little reflection , he went on with a sort of desperate calmness . \u201c I will tell you everything , and then have done for ever . She saw it only as folly , and that folly stamped only by exposure . The want of common discretion , of caution : his going down to Richmond for the whole time of her being at Twickenham ; her putting herself in the power of a servant ; it was the detection , in short \u2014 oh , Fanny ! it was the detection , not the offence , which she reprobated . It was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity , and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her . \u201d He stopt . \u201c And what , \u201d said Fanny ( believing herself required to speak ) , \u201c what could you say ? \u201d \u201c Nothing , nothing to be understood . I was like a man stunned . She went on , began to talk of you ; yes , then she began to talk of you , regretting , as well she might , the loss of such a\u2014. There she spoke very rationally . But she has always done justice to you . \u2018 He has thrown away , \u2019 said she , \u2018 such a woman as he will never see again . She would have fixed him ; she would have made him happy for ever . \u2019 My dearest Fanny , I am giving you , I hope , more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been \u2014 but what never can be now . You do not wish me to be silent ? If you do , give me but a look , a word , and I have done . \u201d No look or word was given . \u201c Thank God , \u201d said he . \u201c We were all disposed to wonder , but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer . She spoke of you with high praise and warm affection ; yet , even here , there was alloy , a dash of evil ; for in the midst of it she could exclaim , \u2018 Why would not she have him ? It is all her fault . Simple girl ! I shall never forgive her . Had she accepted him as she ought , they might now have been on the point of marriage , and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object . He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again . It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation , in yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham . \u2019 Could you have believed it possible ? But the charm is broken . My eyes are opened . \u201d \u201c Cruel ! \u201d said Fanny , \u201c quite cruel . At such a moment to give way to gaiety , to speak with lightness , and to you ! Absolute cruelty . \u201d \u201c Cruelty , do you call it ? We differ there . No , hers is not a cruel nature . I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings . The evil lies yet deeper : in her total ignorance , unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings ; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did . She was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak , as she imagined everybody else would speak . Hers are not faults of temper . She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one , and though I may deceive myself , I can not but think that for me , for my feelings , she would\u2014. Hers are faults of principle , Fanny ; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted , vitiated mind . Perhaps it is best for me , since it leaves me so little to regret . Not so , however . Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her , rather than have to think of her as I do . I told her so . \u201d \u201c Did you ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; when I left her I told her so . \u201d \u201c How long were you together ? \u201d \u201c Five - and - twenty minutes . Well , she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them . She spoke of it , Fanny , with a steadier voice than I can . \u201d He was obliged to pause more than once as he continued . \u201c \u2018 We must persuade Henry to marry her , \u2019 said she ; \u2018 and what with honour , and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from Fanny , I do not despair of it . Fanny he must give up . I do not think that even _ he _ could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp , and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty . My influence , which is not small shall all go that way ; and when once married , and properly supported by her own family , people of respectability as they are , she may recover her footing in society to a certain degree . In some circles , we know , she would never be admitted , but with good dinners , and large parties , there will always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance ; and there is , undoubtedly , more liberality and candour on those points than formerly . What I advise is , that your father be quiet . Do not let him injure his own cause by interference . Persuade him to let things take their course . If by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave Henry \u2019s protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him . I know how he is likely to be influenced . Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion , and it may all end well ; but if he get his daughter away , it will be destroying the chief hold . \u2019 \u201d After repeating this , Edmund was so much affected that Fanny , watching him with silent , but most tender concern , was almost sorry that the subject had been entered on at all . It was long before he could speak again . At last , \u201c Now , Fanny , \u201d said he , \u201c I shall soon have done . I have told you the substance of all that she said . As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it . That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now . And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . She was astonished , exceedingly astonished \u2014 more than astonished . I saw her change countenance . She turned extremely red . I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it . She would have laughed if she could . It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , \u2018 A pretty good lecture , upon my word . Was it part of your last sermon ? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . \u2019 She tried to speak carelessly , but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . \u2018 Mr. Bertram , \u2019 said she . I looked back . \u2018 Mr. Bertram , \u2019 said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! Equally in brother and sister deceived ! I thank you for your patience , Fanny . This has been the greatest relief , and now we will have done . \u201d And such was Fanny \u2019s dependence on his words , that for five minutes she thought they _ had _ done . Then , however , it all came on again , or something very like it , and nothing less than Lady Bertram \u2019s rousing thoroughly up could really close such a conversation . Till that happened , they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone , and how she had attached him , and how delightful nature had made her , and how excellent she would have been , had she fallen into good hands earlier . Fanny , now at liberty to speak openly , felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of her real character , by some hint of what share his brother \u2019s state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete reconciliation . This was not an agreeable intimation . Nature resisted it for a while . It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had her more disinterested in her attachment ; but his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason . He submitted to believe that Tom \u2019s illness had influenced her , only reserving for himself this consoling thought , that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits , she had certainly been _ more _ attached to him than could have been expected , and for his sake been more near doing right . Fanny thought exactly the same ; and they were also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect , the indelible impression , which such a disappointment must make on his mind . Time would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings , but still it was a sort of thing which he never could get entirely the better of ; and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could \u2014 it was too impossible to be named but with indignation . Fanny \u2019s friendship was all that he had to cling to .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "Fanny"}, {"position": [7, 8], "text": "her"}, {"position": [15, 16], "text":
