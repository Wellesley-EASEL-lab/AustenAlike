{"document": "XXXVI Edmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fanny could tell , or could leave to be conjectured of her sentiments , and he was satisfied . It had been , as he before presumed , too hasty a measure on Crawford \u2019s side , and time must be given to make the idea first familiar , and then agreeable to her . She must be used to the consideration of his being in love with her , and then a return of affection might not be very distant . He gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his father ; and recommended there being nothing more said to her : no farther attempts to influence or persuade ; but that everything should be left to Crawford \u2019s assiduities , and the natural workings of her own mind . Sir Thomas promised that it should be so . Edmund \u2019s account of Fanny \u2019s disposition he could believe to be just ; he supposed she had all those feelings , but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _ had _ ; for , less willing than his son to trust to the future , he could not help fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were necessary for her , she might not have persuaded herself into receiving his addresses properly before the young man \u2019s inclination for paying them were over . There was nothing to be done , however , but to submit quietly and hope the best . The promised visit from \u201c her friend , \u201d as Edmund called Miss Crawford , was a formidable threat to Fanny , and she lived in continual terror of it . As a sister , so partial and so angry , and so little scrupulous of what she said , and in another light so triumphant and secure , she was in every way an object of painful alarm . Her displeasure , her penetration , and her happiness were all fearful to encounter ; and the dependence of having others present when they met was Fanny \u2019s only support in looking forward to it . She absented herself as little as possible from Lady Bertram , kept away from the East room , and took no solitary walk in the shrubbery , in her caution to avoid any sudden attack . She succeeded . She was safe in the breakfast - room , with her aunt , when Miss Crawford did come ; and the first misery over , and Miss Crawford looking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than she had anticipated , Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse to be endured than a half - hour of moderate agitation . But here she hoped too much ; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity . She was determined to see Fanny alone , and therefore said to her tolerably soon , in a low voice , \u201c I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere \u201d ; words that Fanny felt all over her , in all her pulses and all her nerves . Denial was impossible . Her habits of ready submission , on the contrary , made her almost instantly rise and lead the way out of the room . She did it with wretched feelings , but it was inevitable . They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance was over on Miss Crawford \u2019s side . She immediately shook her head at Fanny with arch , yet affectionate reproach , and taking her hand , seemed hardly able to help beginning directly . She said nothing , however , but , \u201c Sad , sad girl ! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you , \u201d and had discretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure of having four walls to themselves . Fanny naturally turned upstairs , and took her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortable use ; opening the door , however , with a most aching heart , and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before her than ever that spot had yet witnessed . But the evil ready to burst on her was at least delayed by the sudden change in Miss Crawford \u2019s ideas ; by the strong effect on her mind which the finding herself in the East room again produced . \u201c Ha ! \u201d she cried , with instant animation , \u201c am I here again ? The East room ! Once only was I in this room before \u201d ; and after stopping to look about her , and seemingly to retrace all that had then passed , she added , \u201c Once only before . Do you remember it ? I came to rehearse . Your cousin came too ; and we had a rehearsal . You were our audience and prompter . A delightful rehearsal . I shall never forget it . Here we were , just in this part of the room : here was your cousin , here was I , here were the chairs . Oh ! why will such things ever pass away ? \u201d Happily for her companion , she wanted no answer . Her mind was entirely self - engrossed . She was in a reverie of sweet remembrances . \u201c The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable ! The subject of it so very \u2014 very \u2014 what shall I say ? He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me . I think I see him now , trying to be as demure and composed as Anhalt ought , through the two long speeches . \u2018 When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state , matrimony may be called a happy life . \u2019 I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words . It was curious , very curious , that we should have such a scene to play ! If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence , it should be that week \u2014 that acting week . Say what you would , Fanny , it should be _ that _ ; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other . His sturdy spirit to bend as it did ! Oh ! it was sweet beyond expression . But alas , that very evening destroyed it all . That very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle . Poor Sir Thomas , who was glad to see you ? Yet , Fanny , do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas , though I certainly did hate him for many a week . No , I do him justice now . He is just what the head of such a family should be . Nay , in sober sadness , I believe I now love you all . \u201d And having said so , with a degree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her before , and now thought only too becoming , she turned away for a moment to recover herself . \u201c I have had a little fit since I came into this room , as you may perceive , \u201d said she presently , with a playful smile , \u201c but it is over now ; so let us sit down and be comfortable ; for as to scolding you , Fanny , which I came fully intending to do , I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point . \u201d And embracing her very affectionately , \u201c Good , gentle Fanny ! when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long , I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you . \u201d Fanny was affected . She had not foreseen anything of this , and her feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word \u201c last . \u201d She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she possibly could ; and Miss Crawford , yet farther softened by the sight of such emotion , hung about her with fondness , and said , \u201c I hate to leave you . I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going . Who says we shall not be sisters ? I know we shall . I feel that we are born to be connected ; and those tears convince me that you feel it too , dear Fanny . \u201d Fanny roused herself , and replying only in part , said , \u201c But you are only going from one set of friends to another . You are going to a very particular friend . \u201d \u201c Yes , very true . Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years . But I have not the least inclination to go near her . I can think only of the friends I am leaving : my excellent sister , yourself , and the Bertrams in general . You have all so much more _ heart _ among you than one finds in the world at large . You all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you , which in common intercourse one knows nothing of . I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter , a much better time for the visit , but now I can not put her off . And when I have done with her I must go to her sister , Lady Stornaway , because _ she _ was rather my most particular friend of the two , but I have not cared much for _ her _ these three years . \u201d After this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent , each thoughtful : Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in the world , Mary on something of less philosophic tendency . _ She _ first spoke again . \u201c How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs , and setting off to find my way to the East room , without having an idea whereabouts it was ! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along , and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work ; and then your cousin \u2019s astonishment , when he opened the door , at seeing me here ! To be sure , your uncle \u2019s returning that very evening ! There never was anything quite like it . \u201d Another short fit of abstraction followed , when , shaking it off , she thus attacked her companion . \u201c Why , Fanny , you are absolutely in a reverie . Thinking , I hope , of one who is always thinking of you . Oh ! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town , that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there ! Oh ! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens ; the wonder , the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done ! For as to secrecy , Henry is quite the hero of an old romance , and glories in his chains . You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest . If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . Oh ! she has been trying for him to such a degree . Innocent and quiet as you sit here , you can not have an idea of the _ sensation _ that you will be occasioning , of the curiosity there will be to see you , of the endless questions I shall have to answer ! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth , and how you do your hair , and who makes your shoes . I wish Margaret were married , for my poor friend \u2019s sake , for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people . And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time . We were all delighted . She could not do otherwise than accept him , for he was rich , and she had nothing ; but he turns out ill - tempered and _ exigeant _ , and wants a young woman , a beautiful young woman of five - and - twenty , to be as steady as himself . And my friend does not manage him well ; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it . There is a spirit of irritation which , to say nothing worse , is certainly very ill - bred . In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect . Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister , and a certain consideration for her judgment , which makes one feel there _ is _ attachment ; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers . I shall be at Mansfield for ever , Fanny . My own sister as a wife , Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband , are my standards of perfection . Poor Janet has been sadly taken in , and yet there was nothing improper on her side : she did not run into the match inconsiderately ; there was no want of foresight . She took three days to consider of his proposals , and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having , and especially applied to my late dear aunt , whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance , and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser . This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort . I have not so much to say for my friend Flora , who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway , who has about as much sense , Fanny , as Mr. Rushworth , but much worse - looking , and with a blackguard character . I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong . By the bye , Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out . But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference . But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? No , no , I see you are not . \u201d There was , indeed , so deep a blush over Fanny \u2019s face at that moment as might warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind . \u201c Excellent creature ! I will not tease you . Everything shall take its course . But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies . It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject , some surmises as to what might be . You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power . Was not he devoted to you at the ball ? And then before the ball , the necklace ! Oh ! you received it just as it was meant . You were as conscious as heart could desire . I remember it perfectly . \u201d \u201c Do you mean , then , that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand ? Oh ! Miss Crawford , _ that _ was not fair . \u201d \u201c Knew of it ! It was his own doing entirely , his own thought . I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . \u201d \u201c I will not say , \u201d replied Fanny , \u201c that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first \u2014 indeed , indeed I was . It is as true as that I sit here . And had I had an idea of it , nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace . As to your brother \u2019s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me . I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn . I was quiet , but I was not blind . I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . \u201d \u201c Ah ! I can not deny it . He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies \u2019 affections . I have often scolded him for it , but it is his only fault ; and there is this to be said , that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for . And then , Fanny , the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many ; of having it in one \u2019s power to pay off the debts of one \u2019s sex ! Oh ! I am sure it is not in woman \u2019s nature to refuse such a triumph . \u201d Fanny shook her head . \u201c I can not think well of a man who sports with any woman \u2019s feelings ; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander - by can judge of . \u201d \u201c I do not defend him . I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife \u2019s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to . And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . If any man ever loved a woman for ever , I think Henry will do as much for you . \u201d Fanny could not avoid a faint smile , but had nothing to say . \u201c I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , \u201d continued Mary presently , \u201c than when he had succeeded in getting your brother \u2019s commission . \u201d She had made a sure push at Fanny \u2019s feelings here . \u201c Oh ! yes . How very , very kind of him . \u201d \u201c I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move . The Admiral hates trouble , and scorns asking favours ; and there are so many young men \u2019s claims to be attended to in the same way , that a friendship and energy , not very determined , is easily put by . What a happy creature William must be ! I wish we could see him . \u201d Poor Fanny \u2019s mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its varieties . The recollection of what had been done for William was always the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford ; and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary , who had been first watching her complacently , and then musing on something else , suddenly called her attention by saying : \u201c I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here . And I do take leave , longing for a happy reunion , and trusting that when we meet again , it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve . \u201d A very , very kind embrace , and some agitation of manner , accompanied these words . \u201c I shall see your cousin in town soon : he talks of being there tolerably soon ; and Sir Thomas , I dare say , in the course of the spring ; and your eldest cousin , and the Rushworths , and Julia , I am sure of meeting again and again , and all but you . I have two favours to ask , Fanny : one is your correspondence . You must write to me . And the other , that you will often call on Mrs. Grant , and make her amends for my being gone . \u201d The first , at least , of these favours Fanny would rather not have been asked ; but it was impossible for her to refuse the correspondence ; it was impossible for her even not to accede to it more readily than her own judgment authorised . There was no resisting so much apparent affection . Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond treatment , and from having hitherto known so little of it , she was the more overcome by Miss Crawford \u2019s . Besides , there was gratitude towards her , for having made their _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ so much less painful than her fears had predicted . It was over , and she had escaped without reproaches and without detection . Her secret was still her own ; and while that was the case , she thought she could resign herself to almost everything . In the evening there was another parting . Henry Crawford came and sat some time with them ; and her spirits not being previously in the strongest state , her heart was softened for a while towards him , because he really seemed to feel . Quite unlike his usual self , he scarcely said anything . He was evidently oppressed , and Fanny must grieve for him , though hoping she might never see him again till he were the husband of some other woman . When it came to the moment of parting , he would take her hand , he would not be denied it ; he said nothing , however , or nothing that she heard , and when he had left the room , she was better pleased that such a token of friendship had passed . On the morrow the Crawfords were gone . XXXVII Mr. Crawford gone , Sir Thomas \u2019s next object was that he should be missed ; and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blank in the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt , or fancied , an evil . She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering form ; and he did hope that the loss of it , the sinking again into nothing , would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind . He watched her with this idea ; but he could hardly tell with what success . He hardly knew whether there were any difference in her spirits or not . She was always so gentle and retiring that her emotions were beyond his discrimination . He did not understand her : he felt that he did not ; and therefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on the present occasion , and whether she were more or less happy than she had been . Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret , and thought his father a little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could produce any . What chiefly surprised Edmund was , that Crawford \u2019s sister , the friend and companion who had been so much to her , should not be more visibly regretted . He wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _ her _ , and had so little voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation . Alas ! it was this sister , this friend and companion , who was now the chief bane of Fanny \u2019s comfort . If she could have believed Mary \u2019s future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother \u2019s should be , if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his , she would have been light of heart indeed ; but the more she recollected and observed , the more deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford \u2019s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before . On his side the inclination was stronger , on hers less equivocal . His objections , the scruples of his integrity , seemed all done away , nobody could tell how ; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were equally got over \u2014 and equally without apparent reason . It could only be imputed to increasing attachment . His good and her bad feelings yielded to love , and such love must unite them . He was to go to town as soon as some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed \u2014 perhaps within a fortnight ; he talked of going , he loved to talk of it ; and when once with her again , Fanny could not doubt the rest . Her acceptance must be as certain as his offer ; and yet there were bad feelings still remaining which made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her , independently , she believed , independently of self . In their very last conversation , Miss Crawford , in spite of some amiable sensations , and much personal kindness , had still been Miss Crawford ; still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered , and without any suspicion of being so ; darkened , yet fancying itself light . She might love , but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment . Fanny believed there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them ; and she may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford \u2019s future improvement as nearly desperate , for thinking that if Edmund \u2019s influence in this season of love had already done so little in clearing her judgment , and regulating her notions , his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony . Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced , and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford \u2019s nature that participation of the general nature of women which would lead her to adopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own . But as such were Fanny \u2019s persuasions , she suffered very much from them , and could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain . Sir Thomas , meanwhile , went on with his own hopes and his own observations , still feeling a right , by all his knowledge of human nature , to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence on his niece \u2019s spirits , and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving for their return ; and he was soon afterwards able to account for his not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this , by the prospect of another visitor , whose approach he could allow to be quite enough to support the spirits he was watching . William had obtained a ten days \u2019 leave of absence , to be given to Northamptonshire , and was coming , the happiest of lieutenants , because the latest made , to shew his happiness and describe his uniform . He came ; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform there too , had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty . So the uniform remained at Portsmouth , and Edmund conjectured that before Fanny had any chance of seeing it , all its own freshness and all the freshness of its wearer \u2019s feelings must be worn away . It would be sunk into a badge of disgrace ; for what can be more unbecoming , or more worthless , than the uniform of a lieutenant , who has been a lieutenant a year or two , and sees others made commanders before him ? So reasoned Edmund , till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which placed Fanny \u2019s chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all his glory in another light . This scheme was that she should accompany her brother back to Portsmouth , and spend a little time with her own family . It had occurred to Sir Thomas , in one of his dignified musings , as a right and desirable measure ; but before he absolutely made up his mind , he consulted his son . Edmund considered it every way , and saw nothing but what was right . The thing was good in itself , and could not be done at a better time ; and he had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to Fanny . This was enough to determine Sir Thomas ; and a decisive \u201c then so it shall be \u201d closed that stage of the business ; Sir Thomas retiring from it with some feelings of satisfaction , and views of good over and above what he had communicated to his son ; for his prime motive in sending her away had very little to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again , and nothing at all with any idea of making her happy . He certainly wished her to go willingly , but he as certainly wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended ; and that a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park would bring her mind into a sober state , and incline her to a juster estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence , and equal comfort , of which she had the offer . It was a medicinal project upon his niece \u2019s understanding , which he must consider as at present diseased . A residence of eight or nine years in the abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her powers of comparing and judging . Her father \u2019s house would , in all probability , teach her the value of a good income ; and he trusted that she would be the wiser and happier woman , all her life , for the experiment he had devised . Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures , she must have had a strong attack of them when she first understood what was intended , when her uncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents , and brothers , and sisters , from whom she had been divided almost half her life ; of returning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy , with William for the protector and companion of her journey , and the certainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his remaining on land . Had she ever given way to bursts of delight , it must have been then , for she was delighted , but her happiness was of a quiet , deep , heart - swelling sort ; and though never a great talker , she was always more inclined to silence when feeling most strongly . At the moment she could only thank and accept . Afterwards , when familiarised with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened , she could speak more largely to William and Edmund of what she felt ; but still there were emotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words . The remembrance of all her earliest pleasures , and of what she had suffered in being torn from them , came over her with renewed strength , and it seemed as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had since grown out of the separation . To be in the centre of such a circle , loved by so many , and more loved by all than she had ever been before ; to feel affection without fear or restraint ; to feel herself the equal of those who surrounded her ; to be at peace from all mention of the Crawfords , safe from every look which could be fancied a reproach on their account . This was a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that could be but half acknowledged . Edmund , too \u2014 to be two months from _ him _ ( and perhaps she might be allowed to make her absence three ) must do her good . At a distance , unassailed by his looks or his kindness , and safe from the perpetual irritation of knowing his heart , and striving to avoid his confidence , she should be able to reason herself into a properer state ; she should be able to think of him as in London , and arranging everything there , without wretchedness . What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield was to become a slight evil at Portsmouth . The only drawback was the doubt of her aunt Bertram \u2019s being comfortable without her . She was of use to no one else ; but _ there _ she might be missed to a degree that she did not like to think of ; and that part of the arrangement was , indeed , the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish , and what only _ he _ could have accomplished at all . But he was master at Mansfield Park . When he had really resolved on any measure , he could always carry it through ; and now by dint of long talking on the subject , explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny \u2019s sometimes seeing her family , he did induce his wife to let her go ; obtaining it rather from submission , however , than conviction , for Lady Bertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought Fanny ought to go , and therefore that she must . In the calmness of her own dressing - room , in the impartial flow of her own meditations , unbiased by his bewildering statements , she could not acknowledge any necessity for Fanny \u2019s ever going near a father and mother who had done without her so long , while she was so useful to herself . And as to the not missing her , which under Mrs. Norris \u2019s discussion was the point attempted to be proved , she set herself very steadily against admitting any such thing . Sir Thomas had appealed to her reason , conscience , and dignity . He called it a sacrifice , and demanded it of her goodness and self - command as such . But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be very well spared\u2014_she _ being ready to give up all her own time to her as requested \u2014 and , in short , could not really be wanted or missed . \u201c That may be , sister , \u201d was all Lady Bertram \u2019s reply . \u201c I dare say you are very right ; but I am sure I shall miss her very much . \u201d The next step was to communicate with Portsmouth . Fanny wrote to offer herself ; and her mother \u2019s answer , though short , was so kind \u2014 a few simple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect of seeing her child again , as to confirm all the daughter \u2019s views of happiness in being with her \u2014 convincing her that she should now find a warm and affectionate friend in the \u201c mama \u201d who had certainly shewn no remarkable fondness for her formerly ; but this she could easily suppose to have been her own fault or her own fancy . She had probably alienated love by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper , or been unreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many could deserve . Now , when she knew better how to be useful , and how to forbear , and when her mother could be no longer occupied by the incessant demands of a house full of little children , there would be leisure and inclination for every comfort , and they should soon be what mother and daughter ought to be to each other . William was almost as happy in the plan as his sister . It would be the greatest pleasure to him to have her there to the last moment before he sailed , and perhaps find her there still when he came in from his first cruise . And besides , he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush before she went out of harbour \u2014 the Thrush was certainly the finest sloop in the service \u2014 and there were several improvements in the dockyard , too , which he quite longed to shew her . He did not scruple to add that her being at home for a while would be a great advantage to everybody . \u201c I do not know how it is , \u201d said he ; \u201c but we seem to want some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father \u2019s . The house is always in confusion . You will set things going in a better way , I am sure . You will tell my mother how it all ought to be , and you will be so useful to Susan , and you will teach Betsey , and make the boys love and mind you . How right and comfortable it will all be ! \u201d By the time Mrs. Price \u2019s answer arrived , there remained but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield ; and for part of one of those days the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their journey , for when the mode of it came to be talked of , and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her brother - in - law \u2019s money was vain , and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny , they were to travel post ; when she saw Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose , she was struck with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage , and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them , to go and see her poor dear sister Price . She proclaimed her thoughts . She must say that she had more than half a mind to go with the young people ; it would be such an indulgence to her ; she had not seen her poor dear sister Price for more than twenty years ; and it would be a help to the young people in their journey to have her older head to manage for them ; and she could not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity . William and Fanny were horror - struck at the idea . All the comfort of their comfortable journey would be destroyed at once . With woeful countenances they looked at each other . Their suspense lasted an hour or two . No one interfered to encourage or dissuade . Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself ; and it ended , to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece , in the recollection that she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present ; that she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week , and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being useful to them . It had , in fact , occurred to her , that though taken to Portsmouth for nothing , it would be hardly possible for her to avoid paying her own expenses back again . So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the disappointment of her missing such an opportunity , and another twenty years \u2019 absence , perhaps , begun . Edmund \u2019s plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey , this absence of Fanny \u2019s . He too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as his aunt . He had intended , about this time , to be going to London ; but he could not leave his father and mother just when everybody else of most importance to their comfort was leaving them ; and with an effort , felt but not boasted of , he delayed for a week or two longer a journey which he was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness for ever . He told Fanny of it . She knew so much already , that she must know everything . It made the substance of one other confidential discourse about Miss Crawford ; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to be the last time in which Miss Crawford \u2019s name would ever be mentioned between them with any remains of liberty . Once afterwards she was alluded to by him . Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in the evening to write to her soon and often , and promising to be a good correspondent herself ; and Edmund , at a convenient moment , then added in a whisper , \u201c And _ I _ shall write to you , Fanny , when I have anything worth writing about , anything to say that I think you will like to hear , and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter . \u201d Had she doubted his meaning while she listened , the glow in his face , when she looked up at him , would have been decisive . For this letter she must try to arm herself . That a letter from Edmund should be a subject of terror ! She began to feel that she had not yet gone through all the changes of opinion and sentiment which the progress of time and variation of circumstances occasion in this world of changes . The vicissitudes of the human mind had not yet been exhausted by her . Poor Fanny ! though going as she did willingly and eagerly , the last evening at Mansfield Park must still be wretchedness . Her heart was completely sad at parting . She had tears for every room in the house , much more for every beloved inhabitant . She clung to her aunt , because she would miss her ; she kissed the hand of her uncle with struggling sobs , because she had displeased him ; and as for Edmund , she could neither speak , nor look , nor think , when the last moment came with _ him _ ; and it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the affectionate farewell of a brother . All this passed overnight , for the journey was to begin very early in the morning ; and when the small , diminished party met at breakfast , William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Edmund"}, {"position": [4, 5], "text": "himself"}, {"position": [25, 26], "text": "he"}, {"position": [34, 35], "text": "he"},
