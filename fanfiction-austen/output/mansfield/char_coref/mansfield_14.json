{"document": "XXVIII Her uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing - room when Fanny went down . To the former she was an interesting object , and he saw with pleasure the general elegance of her appearance , and her being in remarkably good looks . The neatness and propriety of her dress was all that he would allow himself to commend in her presence , but upon her leaving the room again soon afterwards , he spoke of her beauty with very decided praise . \u201c Yes , \u201d said Lady Bertram , \u201c she looks very well . I sent Chapman to her . \u201d \u201c Look well ! Oh , yes ! \u201d cried Mrs. Norris , \u201c she has good reason to look well with all her advantages : brought up in this family as she has been , with all the benefit of her cousins \u2019 manners before her . Only think , my dear Sir Thomas , what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of giving her . The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married . What would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand ? \u201d Sir Thomas said no more ; but when they sat down to table the eyes of the two young men assured him that the subject might be gently touched again , when the ladies withdrew , with more success . Fanny saw that she was approved ; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still better . From a variety of causes she was happy , and she was soon made still happier ; for in following her aunts out of the room , Edmund , who was holding open the door , said , as she passed him , \u201c You must dance with me , Fanny ; you must keep two dances for me ; any two that you like , except the first . \u201d She had nothing more to wish for . She had hardly ever been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her life . Her cousins \u2019 former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to her ; she felt it to be indeed very charming , and was actually practising her steps about the drawing - room as long as she could be safe from the notice of her aunt Norris , who was entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring the noble fire which the butler had prepared . Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid under any other circumstances , but Fanny \u2019s happiness still prevailed . It was but to think of her conversation with Edmund , and what was the restlessness of Mrs. Norris ? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram ? The gentlemen joined them ; and soon after began the sweet expectation of a carriage , when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed diffused , and they all stood about and talked and laughed , and every moment had its pleasure and its hope . Fanny felt that there must be a struggle in Edmund \u2019s cheerfulness , but it was delightful to see the effort so successfully made . When the carriages were really heard , when the guests began really to assemble , her own gaiety of heart was much subdued : the sight of so many strangers threw her back into herself ; and besides the gravity and formality of the first great circle , which the manners of neither Sir Thomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away , she found herself occasionally called on to endure something worse . She was introduced here and there by her uncle , and forced to be spoken to , and to curtsey , and speak again . This was a hard duty , and she was never summoned to it without looking at William , as he walked about at his ease in the background of the scene , and longing to be with him . The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch . The stiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and more diffused intimacies : little groups were formed , and everybody grew comfortable . Fanny felt the advantage ; and , drawing back from the toils of civility , would have been again most happy , could she have kept her eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford . _ She _ looked all loveliness \u2014 and what might not be the end of it ? Her own musings were brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her , and her thoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost instantly for the first two dances . Her happiness on this occasion was very much _ \u00e0 la mortal _ , finely chequered . To be secure of a partner at first was a most essential good \u2014 for the moment of beginning was now growing seriously near ; and she so little understood her own claims as to think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her , she must have been the last to be sought after , and should have received a partner only through a series of inquiry , and bustle , and interference , which would have been terrible ; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his manner of asking her which she did not like , and she saw his eye glancing for a moment at her necklace , with a smile \u2014 she thought there was a smile \u2014 which made her blush and feel wretched . And though there was no second glance to disturb her , though his object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable , she could not get the better of her embarrassment , heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it , and had no composure till he turned away to some one else . Then she could gradually rise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a partner , a voluntary partner , secured against the dancing began . When the company were moving into the ballroom , she found herself for the first time near Miss Crawford , whose eyes and smiles were immediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother \u2019s had been , and who was beginning to speak on the subject , when Fanny , anxious to get the story over , hastened to give the explanation of the second necklace : the real chain . Miss Crawford listened ; and all her intended compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten : she felt only one thing ; and her eyes , bright as they had been before , shewing they could yet be brighter , she exclaimed with eager pleasure , \u201c Did he ? Did Edmund ? That was like himself . No other man would have thought of it . I honour him beyond expression . \u201d And she looked around as if longing to tell him so . He was not near , he was attending a party of ladies out of the room ; and Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls , and taking an arm of each , they followed with the rest . Fanny \u2019s heart sunk , but there was no leisure for thinking long even of Miss Crawford \u2019s feelings . They were in the ballroom , the violins were playing , and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on anything serious . She must watch the general arrangements , and see how everything was done . In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her , and asked if she were engaged ; and the \u201c Yes , sir ; to Mr. Crawford , \u201d was exactly what he had intended to hear . Mr. Crawford was not far off ; Sir Thomas brought him to her , saying something which discovered to Fanny , that _ she _ was to lead the way and open the ball ; an idea that had never occurred to her before . Whenever she had thought of the minutiae of the evening , it had been as a matter of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford ; and the impression was so strong , that though _ her _ _ uncle _ spoke the contrary , she could not help an exclamation of surprise , a hint of her unfitness , an entreaty even to be excused . To be urging her opinion against Sir Thomas \u2019s was a proof of the extremity of the case ; but such was her horror at the first suggestion , that she could actually look him in the face and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise ; in vain , however : Sir Thomas smiled , tried to encourage her , and then looked too serious , and said too decidedly , \u201c It must be so , my dear , \u201d for her to hazard another word ; and she found herself the next moment conducted by Mr. Crawford to the top of the room , and standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers , couple after couple , as they were formed . She could hardly believe it . To be placed above so many elegant young women ! The distinction was too great . It was treating her like her cousins ! And her thoughts flew to those absent cousins with most unfeigned and truly tender regret , that they were not at home to take their own place in the room , and have their share of a pleasure which would have been so very delightful to them . So often as she had heard them wish for a ball at home as the greatest of all felicities ! And to have them away when it was given \u2014 and for _ her _ to be opening the ball \u2014 and with Mr. Crawford too ! She hoped they would not envy her that distinction _ now _ ; but when she looked back to the state of things in the autumn , to what they had all been to each other when once dancing in that house before , the present arrangement was almost more than she could understand herself . The ball began . It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny , for the first dance at least : her partner was in excellent spirits , and tried to impart them to her ; but she was a great deal too much frightened to have any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at . Young , pretty , and gentle , however , she had no awkwardnesses that were not as good as graces , and there were few persons present that were not disposed to praise her . She was attractive , she was modest , she was Sir Thomas \u2019s niece , and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford . It was enough to give her general favour . Sir Thomas himself was watching her progress down the dance with much complacency ; he was proud of his niece ; and without attributing all her personal beauty , as Mrs. Norris seemed to do , to her transplantation to Mansfield , he was pleased with himself for having supplied everything else : education and manners she owed to him . Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas \u2019s thoughts as he stood , and having , in spite of all his wrongs towards her , a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him , took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of Fanny . Her praise was warm , and he received it as she could wish , joining in it as far as discretion , and politeness , and slowness of speech would allow , and certainly appearing to greater advantage on the subject than his lady did soon afterwards , when Mary , perceiving her on a sofa very near , turned round before she began to dance , to compliment her on Miss Price \u2019s looks . \u201c Yes , she does look very well , \u201d was Lady Bertram \u2019s placid reply . \u201c Chapman helped her to dress . I sent Chapman to her . \u201d Not but that she was really pleased to have Fanny admired ; but she was so much more struck with her own kindness in sending Chapman to her , that she could not get it out of her head . Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _ her _ by commendation of Fanny ; to her , it was as the occasion offered\u2014\u201cAh ! ma\u2019am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! \u201d and Mrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had time for , amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up card - tables , giving hints to Sir Thomas , and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the room . Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her intentions to please . She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter , and filling her with sensations of delightful self - consequence ; and , misinterpreting Fanny \u2019s blushes , still thought she must be doing so when she went to her after the two first dances , and said , with a significant look , \u201c Perhaps _ you _ can tell me why my brother goes to town to - morrow ? He says he has business there , but will not tell me what . The first time he ever denied me his confidence ! But this is what we all come to . All are supplanted sooner or later . Now , I must apply to you for information . Pray , what is Henry going for ? \u201d Fanny protested her ignorance as steadily as her embarrassment allowed . \u201c Well , then , \u201d replied Miss Crawford , laughing , \u201c I must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother , and of talking of you by the way . \u201d Fanny was confused , but it was the confusion of discontent ; while Miss Crawford wondered she did not smile , and thought her over - anxious , or thought her odd , or thought her anything rather than insensible of pleasure in Henry \u2019s attentions . Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the course of the evening ; but Henry \u2019s attentions had very little to do with it . She would much rather _ not _ have been asked by him again so very soon , and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris , about the supper hour , were all for the sake of securing her at that part of the evening . But it was not to be avoided : he made her feel that she was the object of all ; though she could not say that it was unpleasantly done , that there was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner ; and sometimes , when he talked of William , he was really not unagreeable , and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit . But still his attentions made no part of her satisfaction . She was happy whenever she looked at William , and saw how perfectly he was enjoying himself , in every five minutes that she could walk about with him and hear his account of his partners ; she was happy in knowing herself admired ; and she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still to look forward to , during the greatest part of the evening , her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite engagement with _ him _ was in continual perspective . She was happy even when they did take place ; but not from any flow of spirits on his side , or any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning . His mind was fagged , and her happiness sprung from being the friend with whom it could find repose . \u201c I am worn out with civility , \u201d said he . \u201c I have been talking incessantly all night , and with nothing to say . But with _ you _ , Fanny , there may be peace . You will not want to be talked to . Let us have the luxury of silence . \u201d Fanny would hardly even speak her agreement . A weariness , arising probably , in great measure , from the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning , was peculiarly to be respected , and they went down their two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker - on that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son . The evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure . Miss Crawford had been in gay spirits when they first danced together , but it was not her gaiety that could do him good : it rather sank than raised his comfort ; and afterwards , for he found himself still impelled to seek her again , she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the profession to which he was now on the point of belonging . They had talked , and they had been silent ; he had reasoned , she had ridiculed ; and they had parted at last with mutual vexation . Fanny , not able to refrain entirely from observing them , had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied . It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering . Yet some happiness must and would arise from the very conviction that he did suffer . When her two dances with him were over , her inclination and strength for more were pretty well at an end ; and Sir Thomas , having seen her walk rather than dance down the shortening set , breathless , and with her hand at her side , gave his orders for her sitting down entirely . From that time Mr. Crawford sat down likewise . \u201c Poor Fanny ! \u201d cried William , coming for a moment to visit her , and working away his partner \u2019s fan as if for life , \u201c how soon she is knocked up ! Why , the sport is but just begun . I hope we shall keep it up these two hours . How can you be tired so soon ? \u201d \u201c So soon ! my good friend , \u201d said Sir Thomas , producing his watch with all necessary caution ; \u201c it is three o\u2019clock , and your sister is not used to these sort of hours . \u201d \u201c Well , then , Fanny , you shall not get up to - morrow before I go . Sleep as long as you can , and never mind me . \u201d \u201c Oh ! William . \u201d \u201c What ! Did she think of being up before you set off ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! yes , sir , \u201d cried Fanny , rising eagerly from her seat to be nearer her uncle ; \u201c I must get up and breakfast with him . It will be the last time , you know ; the last morning . \u201d \u201c You had better not . He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half - past nine . Mr. Crawford , I think you call for him at half - past nine ? \u201d Fanny was too urgent , however , and had too many tears in her eyes for denial ; and it ended in a gracious \u201c Well , well ! \u201d which was permission . \u201c Yes , half - past nine , \u201d said Crawford to William as the latter was leaving them , \u201c and I shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for _ me _ . \u201d And in a lower tone to Fanny , \u201c I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from . Your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to - morrow . \u201d After a short consideration , Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the early breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone : he should himself be of it ; and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted convinced him that the suspicions whence , he must confess to himself , this very ball had in great measure sprung , were well founded . Mr. Crawford was in love with Fanny . He had a pleasing anticipation of what would be . His niece , meanwhile , did not thank him for what he had just done . She had hoped to have William all to herself the last morning . It would have been an unspeakable indulgence . But though her wishes were overthrown , there was no spirit of murmuring within her . On the contrary , she was so totally unused to have her pleasure consulted , or to have anything take place at all in the way she could desire , that she was more disposed to wonder and rejoice in having carried her point so far , than to repine at the counteraction which followed . Shortly afterward , Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her inclination , by advising her to go immediately to bed . \u201c Advise \u201d was his word , but it was the advice of absolute power , and she had only to rise , and , with Mr. Crawford \u2019s very cordial adieus , pass quietly away ; stopping at the entrance - door , like the Lady of Branxholm Hall , \u201c one moment and no more , \u201d to view the happy scene , and take a last look at the five or six determined couple who were still hard at work ; and then , creeping slowly up the principal staircase , pursued by the ceaseless country - dance , feverish with hopes and fears , soup and negus , sore - footed and fatigued , restless and agitated , yet feeling , in spite of everything , that a ball was indeed delightful . In thus sending her away , Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking merely of her health . It might occur to him that Mr. Crawford had been sitting by her long enough , or he might mean to recommend her as a wife by shewing her persuadableness . XXIX The ball was over , and the breakfast was soon over too ; the last kiss was given , and William was gone . Mr. Crawford had , as he foretold , been very punctual , and short and pleasant had been the meal . After seeing William to the last moment , Fanny walked back to the breakfast - room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change ; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace , conceiving , perhaps , that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm , and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William \u2019s plate might but divide her feelings with the broken egg - shells in Mr. Crawford \u2019s . She sat and cried _ con _ _ amore _ as her uncle intended , but it was _ con _ _ amore _ fraternal and no other . William was gone , and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him . Fanny \u2019s disposition was such that she could never even think of her aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house , without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her when they had been last together ; much less could her feelings acquit her of having done and said and thought everything by William that was due to him for a whole fortnight . It was a heavy , melancholy day . Soon after the second breakfast , Edmund bade them good - bye for a week , and mounted his horse for Peterborough , and then all were gone . Nothing remained of last night but remembrances , which she had nobody to share in . She talked to her aunt Bertram \u2014 she must talk to somebody of the ball ; but her aunt had seen so little of what had passed , and had so little curiosity , that it was heavy work . Lady Bertram was not certain of anybody \u2019s dress or anybody \u2019s place at supper but her own . \u201c She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room \u2014 somebody had whispered something to her ; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . \u201d And these were her longest speeches and clearest communications : the rest was only a languid \u201c Yes , yes ; very well ; did you ? did he ? I did not see _ that _ ; I should not know one from the other . \u201d This was very bad . It was only better than Mrs. Norris \u2019s sharp answers would have been ; but she being gone home with all the supernumerary jellies to nurse a sick maid , there was peace and good - humour in their little party , though it could not boast much beside . The evening was heavy like the day . \u201c I can not think what is the matter with me , \u201d said Lady Bertram , when the tea - things were removed . \u201c I feel quite stupid . It must be sitting up so late last night . Fanny , you must do something to keep me awake . I can not work . Fetch the cards ; I feel so very stupid . \u201d The cards were brought , and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till bedtime ; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself , no sounds were heard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the game\u2014\u201cAnd _ that _ makes thirty - one ; four in hand and eight in crib . You are to deal , ma\u2019am ; shall I deal for you ? \u201d Fanny thought and thought again of the difference which twenty - four hours had made in that room , and all that part of the house . Last night it had been hope and smiles , bustle and motion , noise and brilliancy , in the drawing - room , and out of the drawing - room , and everywhere . Now it was languor , and all but solitude . A good night \u2019s rest improved her spirits . She could think of William the next day more cheerfully ; and as the morning afforded her an opportunity of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford , in a very handsome style , with all the heightenings of imagination , and all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a departed ball , she could afterwards bring her mind without much effort into its everyday state , and easily conform to the tranquillity of the present quiet week . They were indeed a smaller party than she had ever known there for a whole day together , and _ he _ was gone on whom the comfort and cheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended . But this must be learned to be endured . He would soon be always gone ; and she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room with her uncle , hear his voice , receive his questions , and even answer them , without such wretched feelings as she had formerly known . \u201c We miss our two young men , \u201d was Sir Thomas \u2019s observation on both the first and second day , as they formed their very reduced circle after dinner ; and in consideration of Fanny \u2019s swimming eyes , nothing more was said on the first day than to drink their good health ; but on the second it led to something farther . William was kindly commended and his promotion hoped for . \u201c And there is no reason to suppose , \u201d added Sir Thomas , \u201c but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent . As to Edmund , we must learn to do without him . This will be the last winter of his belonging to us , as he has done . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d said Lady Bertram , \u201c but I wish he was not going away . They are all going away , I think . I wish they would stay at home . \u201d This wish was levelled principally at Julia , who had just applied for permission to go to town with Maria ; and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the permission should be granted , Lady Bertram , though in her own good - nature she would not have prevented it , was lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia \u2019s return , which would otherwise have taken place about this time . A great deal of good sense followed on Sir Thomas \u2019s side , tending to reconcile his wife to the arrangement . Everything that a considerate parent _ ought _ to feel was advanced for her use ; and everything that an affectionate mother _ must _ feel in promoting her children \u2019s enjoyment was attributed to her nature . Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm \u201c Yes \u201d ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour \u2019s silent consideration spontaneously observed , \u201c Sir Thomas , I have been thinking \u2014 and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did , for now the others are away we feel the good of it . \u201d Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding , \u201c Very true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion . If we have been kind to _ her _ , she is now quite as necessary to _ us _ . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d said Lady Bertram presently ; \u201c and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have _ her _ . \u201d Sir Thomas paused , half smiled , glanced at his niece , and then gravely replied , \u201c She will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . \u201d \u201c And _ that _ is not very likely to be , Sir Thomas . Who should invite her ? Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . \u201d The week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the great house in Mansfield had a very different character at the Parsonage . To the young lady , at least , in each family , it brought very different feelings . What was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation to Mary . Something arose from difference of disposition and habit : one so easily satisfied , the other so unused to endure ; but still more might be imputed to difference of circumstances . In some points of interest they were exactly opposed to each other . To Fanny \u2019s mind , Edmund \u2019s absence was really , in its cause and its tendency , a relief . To Mary it was every way painful . She felt the want of his society every day , almost every hour , and was too much in want of it to derive anything but irritation from considering the object for which he went . He could not have devised anything more likely to raise his consequence than this week \u2019s absence , occurring as it did at the very time of her brother \u2019s going away , of William Price \u2019s going too , and completing the sort of general break - up of a party which had been so animated . She felt it keenly . They were now a miserable trio , confined within doors by a series of rain and snow , with nothing to do and no variety to hope for . Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions , and acting on them in defiance of her ( and she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball ) , she could not help thinking of him continually when absent , dwelling on his merit and affection , and longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had . His absence was unnecessarily long . He should not have planned such an absence \u2014 he should not have left home for a week , when her own departure from Mansfield was so near . Then she began to blame herself . She wished she had not spoken so warmly in their last conversation . She was afraid she had used some strong , some contemptuous expressions in speaking of the clergy , and that should not have been . It was ill - bred ; it was wrong . She wished such words unsaid with all her heart . Her vexation did not end with the week . All this was bad , but she had still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund ; when Saturday came and still no Edmund ; and when , through the slight communication with the other family which Sunday produced , she learned that he had actually written home to defer his return , having promised to remain some days longer with his friend . If she had felt impatience and regret before \u2014 if she had been sorry for what she said , and feared its too strong effect on him \u2014 she now felt and feared it all tenfold more . She had , moreover , to contend with one disagreeable emotion entirely new to her \u2014 jealousy . His friend Mr. Owen had sisters ; he might find them attractive . But , at any rate , his staying away at a time when , according to all preceding plans , she was to remove to London , meant something that she could not bear . Had Henry returned , as he talked of doing , at the end of three or four days , she should now have been leaving Mansfield . It became absolutely necessary for her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more . She could not live any longer in such solitary wretchedness ; and she made her way to the Park , through difficulties of walking which she had deemed unconquerable a week before , for the chance of hearing a little in addition , for the sake of at least hearing his name . The first half - hour was lost , for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together , and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing . But at last Lady Bertram left the room , and then almost immediately Miss Crawford thus began , with a voice as well regulated as she could\u2014\u201cAnd how do _ you _ like your cousin Edmund \u2019s staying away so long ? Being the only young person at home , I consider _ you _ as the greatest sufferer . You must miss him . Does his staying longer surprise you ? \u201d \u201c I do not know , \u201d said Fanny hesitatingly . \u201c Yes ; I had not particularly expected it . \u201d \u201c Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of . It is the general way all young men do . \u201d \u201c He did not , the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before . \u201d \u201c He finds the house more agreeable _ now _ . He is a very \u2014 a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case . I am looking for Henry every day , and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield . I should like to have seen him once more , I confess . But you must give my compliments to him . Yes ; I think it must be compliments . Is not there a something wanted , Miss Price , in our language \u2014 a something between compliments and \u2014 and love \u2014 to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together ? So many months \u2019 acquaintance ! But compliments may be sufficient here . Was his letter a long one ? Does he give you much account of what he is doing ? Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for ? \u201d \u201c I only heard a part of the letter ; it was to my uncle ; but I believe it was very short ; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines . All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer , and that he had agreed to do so . A _ few _ days longer , or _ some _ days longer ; I am not quite sure which . \u201d \u201c Oh ! if he wrote to his father ; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you . But if he wrote to his father , no wonder he was concise . Who could write chat to Sir Thomas ? If he had written to you , there would have been more particulars . You would have heard of balls and parties . He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody . How many Miss Owens are there ? \u201d \u201c Three grown up . \u201d \u201c Are they musical ? \u201d \u201c I do not at all know . I never heard . \u201d \u201c That is the first question , you know , \u201d said Miss Crawford , trying to appear gay and unconcerned , \u201c which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another . But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies \u2014 about any three sisters just grown up ; for one knows , without being told , exactly what they are : all very accomplished and pleasing , and one very pretty . There is a beauty in every family ; it is a regular thing . Two play on the pianoforte , and one on the harp ; and all sing , or would sing if they were taught , or sing all the better for not being taught ; or something like it . \u201d \u201c I know nothing of the Miss Owens , \u201d said Fanny calmly . \u201c You know nothing and you care less , as people say . Never did tone express indifference plainer . Indeed , how can one care for those one has never seen ? Well , when your cousin comes back , he will find Mansfield very quiet ; all the noisy ones gone , your brother and mine and myself . I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near . She does not like my going . \u201d Fanny felt obliged to speak . \u201c You can not doubt your being missed by many , \u201d said she . \u201c You will be very much missed . \u201d Miss Crawford turned her eye on her , as if wanting to hear or see more , and then laughingly said , \u201c Oh yes ! missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away ; that is , there is a great difference felt . But I am not fishing ; do n\u2019t compliment me . If I _ am _ missed , it will appear . I may be discovered by those who want to see me . I shall not be in any doubtful , or distant , or unapproachable region . \u201d Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak , and Miss Crawford was disappointed ; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her power from one who she thought must know , and her spirits were clouded again . \u201c The Miss Owens , \u201d said she , soon afterwards ; \u201c suppose you were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey ; how should you like it ? Stranger things have happened . I dare say they are trying for it . And they are quite in the right , for it would be a very pretty establishment for them . I do not at all wonder or blame them . It is everybody \u2019s duty to do as well for themselves as they can . Sir Thomas Bertram \u2019s son is somebody ; and now he is in their own line . Their father is a clergyman , and their brother is a clergyman , and they are all clergymen together . He is their lawful property ; he fairly belongs to them . You do n\u2019t speak , Fanny ; Miss Price , you do n\u2019t speak . But honestly now , do not you rather expect it than otherwise ? \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said Fanny stoutly , \u201c I do not expect it at all . \u201d \u201c Not at all ! \u201d cried Miss Crawford with alacrity . \u201c I wonder at that . But I dare say you know exactly \u2014 I always imagine you are \u2014 perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all \u2014 or not at present . \u201d \u201c No , I do not , \u201d said Fanny softly , hoping she did not err either in the belief or the acknowledgment of it . Her companion looked at her keenly ; and gathering greater spirit from the blush soon produced from such a look , only said , \u201c He is best off as he is , \u201d and turned the subject .",
