{"document": "XXXIV Edmund had great things to hear on his return . Many surprises were awaiting him . The first that occurred was not least in interest : the appearance of Henry Crawford and his sister walking together through the village as he rode into it . He had concluded \u2014 he had meant them to be far distant . His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely to avoid Miss Crawford . He was returning to Mansfield with spirits ready to feed on melancholy remembrances , and tender associations , when her own fair self was before him , leaning on her brother \u2019s arm , and he found himself receiving a welcome , unquestionably friendly , from the woman whom , two moments before , he had been thinking of as seventy miles off , and as farther , much farther , from him in inclination than any distance could express . Her reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hoped for , had he expected to see her . Coming as he did from such a purport fulfilled as had taken him away , he would have expected anything rather than a look of satisfaction , and words of simple , pleasant meaning . It was enough to set his heart in a glow , and to bring him home in the properest state for feeling the full value of the other joyful surprises at hand . William \u2019s promotion , with all its particulars , he was soon master of ; and with such a secret provision of comfort within his own breast to help the joy , he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and unvarying cheerfulness all dinner - time . After dinner , when he and his father were alone , he had Fanny \u2019s history ; and then all the great events of the last fortnight , and the present situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him . Fanny suspected what was going on . They sat so much longer than usual in the dining - parlour , that she was sure they must be talking of her ; and when tea at last brought them away , and she was to be seen by Edmund again , she felt dreadfully guilty . He came to her , sat down by her , took her hand , and pressed it kindly ; and at that moment she thought that , but for the occupation and the scene which the tea - things afforded , she must have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable excess . He was not intending , however , by such action , to be conveying to her that unqualified approbation and encouragement which her hopes drew from it . It was designed only to express his participation in all that interested her , and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened every feeling of affection . He was , in fact , entirely on his father \u2019s side of the question . His surprise was not so great as his father \u2019s at her refusing Crawford , because , so far from supposing her to consider him with anything like a preference , he had always believed it to be rather the reverse , and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared , but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more desirable than he did . It had every recommendation to him ; and while honouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present indifference , honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo , he was most earnest in hoping , and sanguine in believing , that it would be a match at last , and that , united by mutual affection , it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other , as he was now beginning seriously to consider them . Crawford had been too precipitate . He had not given her time to attach herself . He had begun at the wrong end . With such powers as his , however , and such a disposition as hers , Edmund trusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion . Meanwhile , he saw enough of Fanny \u2019s embarrassment to make him scrupulously guard against exciting it a second time , by any word , or look , or movement . Crawford called the next day , and on the score of Edmund \u2019s return , Sir Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner ; it was really a necessary compliment . He staid of course , and Edmund had then ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny , and what degree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her manners ; and it was so little , so very , very little \u2014 every chance , every possibility of it , resting upon her embarrassment only ; if there was not hope in her confusion , there was hope in nothing else \u2014 that he was almost ready to wonder at his friend \u2019s perseverance . Fanny was worth it all ; he held her to be worth every effort of patience , every exertion of mind , but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any woman breathing , without something more to warm his courage than his eyes could discern in hers . He was very willing to hope that Crawford saw clearer , and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friend that he could come to from all that he observed to pass before , and at , and after dinner . In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more promising . When he and Crawford walked into the drawing - room , his mother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there were nothing else to care for . Edmund could not help noticing their apparently deep tranquillity . \u201c We have not been so silent all the time , \u201d replied his mother . \u201c Fanny has been reading to me , and only put the book down upon hearing you coming . \u201d And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air of being very recently closed : a volume of Shakespeare . \u201c She often reads to me out of those books ; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man\u2019s \u2014 what \u2019s his name , Fanny?\u2014when we heard your footsteps . \u201d Crawford took the volume . \u201c Let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship , \u201d said he . \u201c I shall find it immediately . \u201d And by carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves , he did find it , or within a page or two , quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram , who assured him , as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey , that he had got the very speech . Not a look or an offer of help had Fanny given ; not a syllable for or against . All her attention was for her work . She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else . But taste was too strong in her . She could not abstract her mind five minutes : she was forced to listen ; his reading was capital , and her pleasure in good reading extreme . To _ good _ reading , however , she had been long used : her uncle read well , her cousins all , Edmund very well , but in Mr. Crawford \u2019s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond what she had ever met with . The King , the Queen , Buckingham , Wolsey , Cromwell , all were given in turn ; for with the happiest knack , the happiest power of jumping and guessing , he could always alight at will on the best scene , or the best speeches of each ; and whether it were dignity , or pride , or tenderness , or remorse , or whatever were to be expressed , he could do it with equal beauty . It was truly dramatic . His acting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play might give , and his reading brought all his acting before her again ; nay , perhaps with greater enjoyment , for it came unexpectedly , and with no such drawback as she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss Bertram . Edmund watched the progress of her attention , and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework , which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally : how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it , and at last , how the eyes which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford \u2014 fixed on him for minutes , fixed on him , in short , till the attraction drew Crawford \u2019s upon her , and the book was closed , and the charm was broken . Then she was shrinking again into herself , and blushing and working as hard as ever ; but it had been enough to give Edmund encouragement for his friend , and as he cordially thanked him , he hoped to be expressing Fanny \u2019s secret feelings too . \u201c That play must be a favourite with you , \u201d said he ; \u201c you read as if you knew it well . \u201d \u201c It will be a favourite , I believe , from this hour , \u201d replied Crawford ; \u201c but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen . I once saw Henry the Eighth acted , or I have heard of it from somebody who did , I am not certain which . But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how . It is a part of an Englishman \u2019s constitution . His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere ; one is intimate with him by instinct . No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately . \u201d \u201c No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree , \u201d said Edmund , \u201c from one \u2019s earliest years . His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody ; they are in half the books we open , and we all talk Shakespeare , use his similes , and describe with his descriptions ; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it . To know him in bits and scraps is common enough ; to know him pretty thoroughly is , perhaps , not uncommon ; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent . \u201d \u201c Sir , you do me honour , \u201d was Crawford \u2019s answer , with a bow of mock gravity . Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny , to see if a word of accordant praise could be extorted from her ; yet both feeling that it could not be . Her praise had been given in her attention ; _ that _ must content them . Lady Bertram \u2019s admiration was expressed , and strongly too . \u201c It was really like being at a play , \u201d said she . \u201c I wish Sir Thomas had been here . \u201d Crawford was excessively pleased . If Lady Bertram , with all her incompetency and languor , could feel this , the inference of what her niece , alive and enlightened as she was , must feel , was elevating . \u201c You have a great turn for acting , I am sure , Mr. Crawford , \u201d said her ladyship soon afterwards ; \u201c and I will tell you what , I think you will have a theatre , some time or other , at your house in Norfolk . I mean when you are settled there . I do indeed . I think you will fit up a theatre at your house in Norfolk . \u201d \u201c Do you , ma\u2019am ? \u201d cried he , with quickness . \u201c No , no , that will never be . Your ladyship is quite mistaken . No theatre at Everingham ! Oh no ! \u201d And he looked at Fanny with an expressive smile , which evidently meant , \u201c That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham . \u201d Edmund saw it all , and saw Fanny so determined _ not _ to see it , as to make it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of the protestation ; and such a quick consciousness of compliment , such a ready comprehension of a hint , he thought , was rather favourable than not . The subject of reading aloud was farther discussed . The two young men were the only talkers , but they , standing by the fire , talked over the too common neglect of the qualification , the total inattention to it , in the ordinary school - system for boys , the consequently natural , yet in some instances almost unnatural , degree of ignorance and uncouthness of men , of sensible and well - informed men , when suddenly called to the necessity of reading aloud , which had fallen within their notice , giving instances of blunders , and failures with their secondary causes , the want of management of the voice , of proper modulation and emphasis , of foresight and judgment , all proceeding from the first cause : want of early attention and habit ; and Fanny was listening again with great entertainment . \u201c Even in my profession , \u201d said Edmund , with a smile , \u201c how little the art of reading has been studied ! how little a clear manner , and good delivery , have been attended to ! I speak rather of the past , however , than the present . There is now a spirit of improvement abroad ; but among those who were ordained twenty , thirty , forty years ago , the larger number , to judge by their performance , must have thought reading was reading , and preaching was preaching . It is different now . The subject is more justly considered . It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths ; and besides , there is more general observation and taste , a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly ; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter , and who can judge and criticise . \u201d Edmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination ; and upon this being understood , he had a variety of questions from Crawford as to his feelings and success ; questions , which being made , though with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste , without any touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew to be most offensive to Fanny , he had true pleasure in satisfying ; and when Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the properest manner in which particular passages in the service should be delivered , shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before , and thought with judgment , Edmund was still more and more pleased . This would be the way to Fanny \u2019s heart . She was not to be won by all that gallantry and wit and good - nature together could do ; or , at least , she would not be won by them nearly so soon , without the assistance of sentiment and feeling , and seriousness on serious subjects . \u201c Our liturgy , \u201d observed Crawford , \u201c has beauties , which not even a careless , slovenly style of reading can destroy ; but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt . For myself , at least , I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be \u201d ( here was a glance at Fanny ) ; \u201c that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read , and longing to have it to read myself . Did you speak ? \u201d stepping eagerly to Fanny , and addressing her in a softened voice ; and upon her saying \u201c No , \u201d he added , \u201c Are you sure you did not speak ? I saw your lips move . I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive , and not _ allow _ my thoughts to wander . Are not you going to tell me so ? \u201d \u201c No , indeed , you know your duty too well for me to \u2014 even supposing \u2014 \u201d She stopt , felt herself getting into a puzzle , and could not be prevailed on to add another word , not by dint of several minutes of supplication and waiting . He then returned to his former station , and went on as if there had been no such tender interruption . \u201c A sermon , well delivered , is more uncommon even than prayers well read . A sermon , good in itself , is no rare thing . It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well ; that is , the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study . A thoroughly good sermon , thoroughly well delivered , is a capital gratification . I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect , and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself . There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit , when it is really eloquence , which is entitled to the highest praise and honour . The preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers , on subjects limited , and long worn threadbare in all common hands ; who can say anything new or striking , anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste , or wearing out the feelings of his hearers , is a man whom one could not , in his public capacity , honour enough . I should like to be such a man . \u201d Edmund laughed . \u201c I should indeed . I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy . But then , I must have a London audience . I could not preach but to the educated ; to those who were capable of estimating my composition . And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often ; now and then , perhaps once or twice in the spring , after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together ; but not for a constancy ; it would not do for a constancy . \u201d Here Fanny , who could not but listen , involuntarily shook her head , and Crawford was instantly by her side again , entreating to know her meaning ; and as Edmund perceived , by his drawing in a chair , and sitting down close by her , that it was to be a very thorough attack , that looks and undertones were to be well tried , he sank as quietly as possible into a corner , turned his back , and took up a newspaper , very sincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover ; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in murmurs of his own , over the various advertisements of \u201c A most desirable Estate in South Wales \u201d ; \u201c To Parents and Guardians \u201d ; and a \u201c Capital season\u2019d Hunter . \u201d Fanny , meanwhile , vexed with herself for not having been as motionless as she was speechless , and grieved to the heart to see Edmund \u2019s arrangements , was trying by everything in the power of her modest , gentle nature , to repulse Mr. Crawford , and avoid both his looks and inquiries ; and he , unrepulsable , was persisting in both . \u201c What did that shake of the head mean ? \u201d said he . \u201c What was it meant to express ? Disapprobation , I fear . But of what ? What had I been saying to displease you ? Did you think me speaking improperly , lightly , irreverently on the subject ? Only tell me if I was . Only tell me if I was wrong . I want to be set right . Nay , nay , I entreat you ; for one moment put down your work . What did that shake of the head mean ? \u201d In vain was her \u201c Pray , sir , do n\u2019t ; pray , Mr. Crawford , \u201d repeated twice over ; and in vain did she try to move away . In the same low , eager voice , and the same close neighbourhood , he went on , reurging the same questions as before . She grew more agitated and displeased . \u201c How can you , sir ? You quite astonish me ; I wonder how you can \u2014 \u201d \u201c Do I astonish you ? \u201d said he . \u201c Do you wonder ? Is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand ? I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner , all that gives me an interest in what you look and do , and excites my present curiosity . I will not leave you to wonder long . \u201d In spite of herself , she could not help half a smile , but she said nothing . \u201c You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy . Yes , that was the word . Constancy : I am not afraid of the word . I would spell it , read it , write it with anybody . I see nothing alarming in the word . Did you think I ought ? \u201d \u201c Perhaps , sir , \u201d said Fanny , wearied at last into speaking\u2014\u201cperhaps , sir , I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment . \u201d Crawford , delighted to get her to speak at any rate , was determined to keep it up ; and poor Fanny , who had hoped to silence him by such an extremity of reproof , found herself sadly mistaken , and that it was only a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another . He had always something to entreat the explanation of . The opportunity was too fair . None such had occurred since his seeing her in her uncle \u2019s room , none such might occur again before his leaving Mansfield . Lady Bertram \u2019s being just on the other side of the table was a trifle , for she might always be considered as only half - awake , and Edmund \u2019s advertisements were still of the first utility . \u201c Well , \u201d said Crawford , after a course of rapid questions and reluctant answers ; \u201c I am happier than I was , because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me . You think me unsteady : easily swayed by the whim of the moment , easily tempted , easily put aside . With such an opinion , no wonder that \u2014 But we shall see.\u2014It is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged ; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady . My conduct shall speak for me ; absence , distance , time shall speak for me . _ They _ shall prove that , as far as you can be deserved by anybody , I do deserve you . You are infinitely my superior in merit ; all _ that _ I know . You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature . You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what \u2014 not merely beyond what one sees , because one never sees anything like it \u2014 but beyond what one fancies might be . But still I am not frightened . It is not by equality of merit that you can be won . That is out of the question . It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest , who loves you most devotedly , that has the best right to a return . There I build my confidence . By that right I do and will deserve you ; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it , I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes . Yes , dearest , sweetest Fanny . Nay \u201d ( seeing her draw back displeased ) , \u201c forgive me . Perhaps I have as yet no right ; but by what other name can I call you ? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other ? No , it is \u2018 Fanny \u2019 that I think of all day , and dream of all night . You have given the name such reality of sweetness , that nothing else can now be descriptive of you . \u201d Fanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer , or have refrained from at least trying to get away in spite of all the too public opposition she foresaw to it , had it not been for the sound of approaching relief , the very sound which she had been long watching for , and long thinking strangely delayed . The solemn procession , headed by Baddeley , of tea - board , urn , and cake - bearers , made its appearance , and delivered her from a grievous imprisonment of body and mind . Mr. Crawford was obliged to move . She was at liberty , she was busy , she was protected . Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those who might speak and hear . But though the conference had seemed full long to him , and though on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation , he inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened to without some profit to the speaker . XXXV Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or not ; and that if she did not lead the way , it should never be touched on by him ; but after a day or two of mutual reserve , he was induced by his father to change his mind , and try what his influence might do for his friend . A day , and a very early day , was actually fixed for the Crawfords \u2019 departure ; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more effort for the young man before he left Mansfield , that all his professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to sustain them as possible . Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr. Crawford \u2019s character in that point . He wished him to be a model of constancy ; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not trying him too long . Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business ; he wanted to know Fanny \u2019s feelings . She had been used to consult him in every difficulty , and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now ; he hoped to be of service to her , he thought he must be of service to her ; whom else had she to open her heart to ? If she did not need counsel , she must need the comfort of communication . Fanny estranged from him , silent and reserved , was an unnatural state of things ; a state which he must break through , and which he could easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through . \u201c I will speak to her , sir : I will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , \u201d was the result of such thoughts as these ; and upon Sir Thomas \u2019s information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery , he instantly joined her . \u201c I am come to walk with you , Fanny , \u201d said he . \u201c Shall I ? \u201d Drawing her arm within his . \u201c It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together . \u201d She assented to it all rather by look than word . Her spirits were low . \u201c But , Fanny , \u201d he presently added , \u201c in order to have a comfortable walk , something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together . You must talk to me . I know you have something on your mind . I know what you are thinking of . You can not suppose me uninformed . Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself ? \u201d Fanny , at once agitated and dejected , replied , \u201c If you hear of it from everybody , cousin , there can be nothing for me to tell . \u201d \u201c Not of facts , perhaps ; but of feelings , Fanny . No one but you can tell me them . I do not mean to press you , however . If it is not what you wish yourself , I have done . I had thought it might be a relief . \u201d \u201c I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what I feel . \u201d \u201c Do you suppose that we think differently ? I have no idea of it . I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point \u2014 I consider Crawford \u2019s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection . I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him . Can there be any disagreement between us here ? \u201d \u201c Oh no ! But I thought you blamed me . I thought you were against me . This is such a comfort ! \u201d \u201c This comfort you might have had sooner , Fanny , had you sought it . But how could you possibly suppose me against you ? How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ? Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? \u201d \u201c My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . \u201d \u201c As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right . I may be sorry , I may be surprised \u2014 though hardly _ that _ , for you had not had time to attach yourself \u2014 but I think you perfectly right . Can it admit of a question ? It is disgraceful to us if it does . You did not love him ; nothing could have justified your accepting him . \u201d Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days . \u201c So far your conduct has been faultless , and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise . But the matter does not end here . Crawford \u2019s is no common attachment ; he perseveres , with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before . This , we know , must be a work of time . But \u201d ( with an affectionate smile ) \u201c let him succeed at last , Fanny , let him succeed at last . You have proved yourself upright and disinterested , prove yourself grateful and tender - hearted ; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for . \u201d \u201c Oh ! never , never , never ! he never will succeed with me . \u201d And she spoke with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund , and which she blushed at the recollection of herself , when she saw his look , and heard him reply , \u201c Never ! Fanny!\u2014so very determined and positive ! This is not like yourself , your rational self . \u201d \u201c I mean , \u201d she cried , sorrowfully correcting herself , \u201c that I _ think _ I never shall , as far as the future can be answered for ; I think I never shall return his regard . \u201d \u201c I must hope better things . I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years \u2019 growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation . I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him . I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for . I wish he had known you as well as I do , Fanny . Between us , I think we should have won you . My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed . He should have worked upon my plans . I must hope , however , that time , proving him ( as I firmly believe it will ) to deserve you by his steady affection , will give him his reward . I can not suppose that you have not the _ wish _ to love him \u2014 the natural wish of gratitude . You must have some feeling of that sort . You must be sorry for your own indifference . \u201d \u201c We are so totally unlike , \u201d said Fanny , avoiding a direct answer , \u201c we are so very , very different in all our inclinations and ways , that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together , even if I _ could _ like him . There never were two people more dissimilar . We have not one taste in common . We should be miserable . \u201d \u201c You are mistaken , Fanny . The dissimilarity is not so strong . You are quite enough alike . You _ have _ tastes in common . You have moral and literary tastes in common . You have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings ; and , Fanny , who that heard him read , and saw you listen to Shakespeare the other night , will think you unfitted as companions ? You forget yourself : there is a decided difference in your tempers , I allow . He is lively , you are serious ; but so much the better : his spirits will support yours . It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are . His cheerfulness will counteract this . He sees difficulties nowhere : and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you . Your being so far unlike , Fanny , does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together : do not imagine it . I am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance . I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike : I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits , in the manners , in the inclination for much or little company , in the propensity to talk or to be silent , to be grave or to be gay . Some opposition here is , I am thoroughly convinced , friendly to matrimonial happiness . I exclude extremes , of course ; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme . A counteraction , gentle and continual , is the best safeguard of manners and conduct . \u201d Full well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now : Miss Crawford \u2019s power was all returning . He had been speaking of her cheerfully from the hour of his coming home . His avoiding her was quite at an end . He had dined at the Parsonage only the preceding day . After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes , Fanny , feeling it due to herself , returned to Mr. Crawford , and said , \u201c It is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _ that _ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more . I must say , cousin , that I can not approve his character . I have not thought well of him from the time of the play . I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly \u2014 I may speak of it now because it is all over \u2014 so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which \u2014 in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over . \u201d \u201c My dear Fanny , \u201d replied Edmund , scarcely hearing her to the end , \u201c let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly . The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect . Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself . Compared with me , all the rest were blameless . I was playing the fool with my eyes open . \u201d \u201c As a bystander , \u201d said Fanny , \u201c perhaps I saw more than you did ; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous . \u201d \u201c Very possibly . No wonder . Nothing could be more improper than the whole business . I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest . \u201d \u201c Before the play , I am much mistaken if _ Julia _ did not think he was paying her attentions . \u201d \u201c Julia ! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia ; but I could never see anything of it . And , Fanny , though I hope I do justice to my sisters \u2019 good qualities , I think it very possible that they might , one or both , be more desirous of being admired by Crawford , and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent . I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society ; and with such encouragement , a man like Crawford , lively , and it may be , a little unthinking , might be led on to \u2014 there could be nothing very striking , because it is clear that he had no pretensions : his heart was reserved for you . And I must say , that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion . It does him the highest honour ; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment . It proves him unspoilt by his uncle . It proves him , in short , everything that I had been used to wish to believe him , and feared he was not . \u201d \u201c I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . \u201d \u201c Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case . How could it be otherwise , with such an education and adviser ? Under the disadvantages , indeed , which both have had , is it not wonderful that they should be what they are ? Crawford \u2019s _ feelings _ , I am ready to acknowledge , have hitherto been too much his guides . Happily , those feelings have generally been good . You will supply the rest ; and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature \u2014 to a woman who , firm as a rock in her own principles , has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them . He has chosen his partner , indeed , with rare felicity . He will make you happy , Fanny ; I know he will make you happy ; but you will make him everything . \u201d \u201c I would not engage in such a charge , \u201d cried Fanny , in a shrinking accent ; \u201c in such an office of high responsibility ! \u201d \u201c As usual , believing yourself unequal to anything ! fancying everything too much for you ! Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust . I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may . I have no common interest in Crawford \u2019s well - doing . Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me . You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford . \u201d Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say ; and they walked on together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction . Edmund first began again \u2014 \u201c I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light . I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune . I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear . But it was very different . She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought . She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself . We had a long talk about it . I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself . Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . \u201d \u201c Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? \u201d \u201c Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in . \u201d \u201c It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . \u201d \u201c Yes , she laments it ; yet owns it may have been best . You will see her , however , before she goes . She is very angry with you , Fanny ; you must be prepared for that . She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger . It is the regret and disappointment of a sister , who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for , at the first moment . She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart . \u201d \u201c I knew she would be very angry with me . \u201d \u201c My dearest Fanny , \u201d cried Edmund , pressing her arm closer to him , \u201c do not let the idea of her anger distress you . It is anger to be talked of rather than felt . Her heart is made for love and kindness , not for resentment . I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise ; I wish you could have seen her countenance , when she said that you _ should _ be Henry \u2019s wife . And I observed that she always spoke of you as \u2018 Fanny , \u2019 which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality . \u201d \u201c And Mrs. Grant , did she say \u2014 did she speak ; was she there all the time ? \u201d \u201c Yes , she was agreeing exactly with her sister . The surprise of your refusal , Fanny , seems to have been unbounded . That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand . I said what I could for you ; but in good truth , as they stated the case \u2014 you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct ; nothing else will satisfy them . But this is teasing you . I have done . Do not turn away from me . \u201d \u201c I _ should _ have thought , \u201d said Fanny , after a pause of recollection and exertion , \u201c that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man \u2019s not being approved , not being loved by some one of her sex at least , let him be ever so generally agreeable . Let him have all the perfections in the world , I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself . But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ? He took me wholly by surprise . I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . In my situation , it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford . I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . How , then , was I to be \u2014 to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ? How was I to have an attachment at his service , as soon as it was asked for ? His sisters should consider me as well as him . The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him . And , and \u2014 we think very differently of the nature of women , if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply . \u201d \u201c My dear , dear Fanny , now I have the truth . I know this to be the truth ; and most worthy of you are such feelings . I had attributed them to you before . I thought I could understand you . You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry . I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford \u2019s addresses was against him . Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character . Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother . She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time , and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years \u2019 happy marriage . \u201d Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for . Her feelings were all in revolt . She feared she had been doing wrong : saying too much , overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary ; in guarding against one evil , laying herself open to another ; and to have Miss Crawford \u2019s liveliness repeated to her at such a moment , and on such a subject , was a bitter aggravation . Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face , and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion ; and not even to mention the name of Crawford again , except as it might be connected with what _ must _ be agreeable to her . On this principle , he soon afterwards observed\u2014\u201cThey go on Monday . You are sure , therefore , of seeing your friend either to - morrow or Sunday . They really go on Monday ; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day ! I had almost promised it . What a difference it might have made ! Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life . \u201d \u201c You were near staying there ? \u201d \u201c Very . I was most kindly pressed , and had nearly consented . Had I received any letter from Mansfield , to tell me how you were all going on , I believe I should certainly have staid ; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight , and felt that I had been away long enough . \u201d \u201c You spent your time pleasantly there ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; that is , it was the fault of my own mind if I did not . They were all very pleasant . I doubt their finding me so . I took uneasiness with me , and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again . \u201d \u201c The Miss Owens \u2014 you liked them , did not you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very well . Pleasant , good - humoured , unaffected girls . But I am spoilt , Fanny , for common female society . Good - humoured , unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women . They are two distinct orders of being . You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . \u201d Still , however , Fanny was oppressed and wearied ; he saw it in her looks , it could not be talked away ; and attempting it no more , he led her directly , with the kind authority of a privileged guardian , into the house .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Edmund"}, {"position": [8, 9], "text": "his"}, {"position":
