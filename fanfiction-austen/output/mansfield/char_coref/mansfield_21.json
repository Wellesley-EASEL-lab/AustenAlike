{"document": "XLII The Prices were just setting off for church the next day when Mr. Crawford appeared again . He came , not to stop , but to join them ; he was asked to go with them to the Garrison chapel , which was exactly what he had intended , and they all walked thither together . The family were now seen to advantage . Nature had given them no inconsiderable share of beauty , and every Sunday dressed them in their cleanest skins and best attire . Sunday always brought this comfort to Fanny , and on this Sunday she felt it more than ever . Her poor mother now did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram \u2019s sister as she was but too apt to look . It often grieved her to the heart to think of the contrast between them ; to think that where nature had made so little difference , circumstances should have made so much , and that her mother , as handsome as Lady Bertram , and some years her junior , should have an appearance so much more worn and faded , so comfortless , so slatternly , so shabby . But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerably cheerful - looking Mrs. Price , coming abroad with a fine family of children , feeling a little respite of her weekly cares , and only discomposed if she saw her boys run into danger , or Rebecca pass by with a flower in her hat . In chapel they were obliged to divide , but Mr. Crawford took care not to be divided from the female branch ; and after chapel he still continued with them , and made one in the family party on the ramparts . Mrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday throughout the year , always going directly after morning service and staying till dinner - time . It was her public place : there she met her acquaintance , heard a little news , talked over the badness of the Portsmouth servants , and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing . Thither they now went ; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss Prices as his peculiar charge ; and before they had been there long , somehow or other , there was no saying how , Fanny could not have believed it , but he was walking between them with an arm of each under his , and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it . It made her uncomfortable for a time , but yet there were enjoyments in the day and in the view which would be felt . The day was uncommonly lovely . It was really March ; but it was April in its mild air , brisk soft wind , and bright sun , occasionally clouded for a minute ; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of such a sky , the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships at Spithead and the island beyond , with the ever - varying hues of the sea , now at high water , dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts with so fine a sound , produced altogether such a combination of charms for Fanny , as made her gradually almost careless of the circumstances under which she felt them . Nay , had she been without his arm , she would soon have known that she needed it , for she wanted strength for a two hours \u2019 saunter of this kind , coming , as it generally did , upon a week \u2019s previous inactivity . Fanny was beginning to feel the effect of being debarred from her usual regular exercise ; she had lost ground as to health since her being in Portsmouth ; and but for Mr. Crawford and the beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up now . The loveliness of the day , and of the view , he felt like herself . They often stopt with the same sentiment and taste , leaning against the wall , some minutes , to look and admire ; and considering he was not Edmund , Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the charms of nature , and very well able to express his admiration . She had a few tender reveries now and then , which he could sometimes take advantage of to look in her face without detection ; and the result of these looks was , that though as bewitching as ever , her face was less blooming than it ought to be . She _ said _ she was very well , and did not like to be supposed otherwise ; but take it all in all , he was convinced that her present residence could not be comfortable , and therefore could not be salutary for her , and he was growing anxious for her being again at Mansfield , where her own happiness , and his in seeing her , must be so much greater . \u201c You have been here a month , I think ? \u201d said he . \u201c No ; not quite a month . It is only four weeks to - morrow since I left Mansfield . \u201d \u201c You are a most accurate and honest reckoner . I should call that a month . \u201d \u201c I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening . \u201d \u201c And it is to be a two months \u2019 visit , is not ? \u201d \u201c Yes . My uncle talked of two months . I suppose it will not be less . \u201d \u201c And how are you to be conveyed back again ? Who comes for you ? \u201d \u201c I do not know . I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt . Perhaps I may be to stay longer . It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months \u2019 end . \u201d After a moment \u2019s reflection , Mr. Crawford replied , \u201c I know Mansfield , I know its way , I know its faults towards _ you _ . I know the danger of your being so far forgotten , as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family . I am aware that you may be left here week after week , if Sir Thomas can not settle everything for coming himself , or sending your aunt \u2019s maid for you , without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year . This will not do . Two months is an ample allowance ; I should think six weeks quite enough . I am considering your sister \u2019s health , \u201d said he , addressing himself to Susan , \u201c which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to . She requires constant air and exercise . When you know her as well as I do , I am sure you will agree that she does , and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country . If , therefore \u201d ( turning again to Fanny ) , \u201c you find yourself growing unwell , and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield , without waiting for the two months to be ended , _ that _ must not be regarded as of any consequence , if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual , and will only let my sister know it , give her only the slightest hint , she and I will immediately come down , and take you back to Mansfield . You know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done . You know all that would be felt on the occasion . \u201d Fanny thanked him , but tried to laugh it off . \u201c I am perfectly serious , \u201d he replied , \u201c as you perfectly know . And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition . Indeed , you shall _ not _ ; it shall not be in your power ; for so long only as you positively say , in every letter to Mary , \u2018 I am well , \u2019 and I know you can not speak or write a falsehood , so long only shall you be considered as well . \u201d Fanny thanked him again , but was affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much , or even to be certain of what she ought to say . This was towards the close of their walk . He attended them to the last , and left them only at the door of their own house , when he knew them to be going to dinner , and therefore pretended to be waited for elsewhere . \u201c I wish you were not so tired , \u201d said he , still detaining Fanny after all the others were in the house\u2014\u201cI wish I left you in stronger health . Is there anything I can do for you in town ? I have half an idea of going into Norfolk again soon . I am not satisfied about Maddison . I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible , and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill , which I design for somebody else . I must come to an understanding with him . I must make him know that I will not be tricked on the south side of Everingham , any more than on the north : that I will be master of my own property . I was not explicit enough with him before . The mischief such a man does on an estate , both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor , is inconceivable . I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly , and put everything at once on such a footing as can not be afterwards swerved from . Maddison is a clever fellow ; I do not wish to displace him , provided he does not try to displace _ me _ ; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me , and worse than simple to let him give me a hard - hearted , griping fellow for a tenant , instead of an honest man , to whom I have given half a promise already . Would it not be worse than simple ? Shall I go ? Do you advise it ? \u201d \u201c I advise ! You know very well what is right . \u201d \u201c Yes . When you give me your opinion , I always know what is right . Your judgment is my rule of right . \u201d \u201c Oh , no ! do not say so . We have all a better guide in ourselves , if we would attend to it , than any other person can be . Good - bye ; I wish you a pleasant journey to - morrow . \u201d \u201c Is there nothing I can do for you in town ? \u201d \u201c Nothing ; I am much obliged to you . \u201d \u201c Have you no message for anybody ? \u201d \u201c My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . \u201d \u201c Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . \u201d He could say no more , for Fanny would be no longer detained . He pressed her hand , looked at her , and was gone . _ He _ went to while away the next three hours as he could , with his other acquaintance , till the best dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment , and _ she _ turned in to her more simple one immediately . Their general fare bore a very different character ; and could he have suspected how many privations , besides that of exercise , she endured in her father \u2019s house , he would have wondered that her looks were not much more affected than he found them . She was so little equal to Rebecca \u2019s puddings and Rebecca \u2019s hashes , brought to table , as they all were , with such accompaniments of half - cleaned plates , and not half - cleaned knives and forks , that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns . After being nursed up at Mansfield , it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth ; and though Sir Thomas , had he known all , might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved , both mind and body , into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford \u2019s good company and good fortune , he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther , lest she might die under the cure . Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day . Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again , she could not help being low . It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend ; and though , in one light , glad to have him gone , it seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody ; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield ; and she could not think of his returning to town , and being frequently with Mary and Edmund , without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having them . Her dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her ; a friend or two of her father \u2019s , as always happened if he was not with them , spent the long , long evening there ; and from six o\u2019clock till half - past nine , there was little intermission of noise or grog . She was very low . The wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr. Crawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within the current of her thoughts . Not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him , nor how much might be owing to contrast , she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others than formerly . And , if in little things , must it not be so in great ? So anxious for her health and comfort , so very feeling as he now expressed himself , and really seemed , might not it be fairly supposed that he would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her ? XLIII It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back , to London , on the morrow , for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price \u2019s ; and two days afterwards , it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from his sister , opened and read by her , on another account , with the most anxious curiosity : \u2014 \u201c I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect . This , as well as I understand , is to be the substance of my information . He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love . I have not time for writing much , but it would be out of place if I had , for this is to be a mere letter of business , penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information , which could not be delayed without risk of evil . My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you ! You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . I have no news for you . You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time . I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin \u2019s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long ago ; suffice it , that everything was just as it ought to be , in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness , and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit . My friend , Mrs. Fraser , is mad for such a house , and it would not make _ me _ miserable . I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter ; she seems in high spirits , and very happy . I fancy Lord S. is very good - humoured and pleasant in his own family , and I do not think him so very ill - looking as I did \u2014 at least , one sees many worse . He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund . Of the last - mentioned hero , what shall I say ? If I avoided his name entirely , it would look suspicious . I will say , then , that we have seen him two or three times , and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance . Mrs. Fraser ( no bad judge ) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person , height , and air ; and I must confess , when he dined here the other day , there were none to compare with him , and we were a party of sixteen . Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales , but \u2014 but \u2014 but Yours affectionately . \u201d \u201c I had almost forgot ( it was Edmund \u2019s fault : he gets into my head more than does me good ) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself \u2014 I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire . My dear little creature , do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks . Those vile sea - breezes are the ruin of beauty and health . My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea , which the Admiral of course never believed , but I know it was so . I am at your service and Henry \u2019s , at an hour \u2019s notice . I should like the scheme , and we would make a little circuit , and shew you Everingham in our way , and perhaps you would not mind passing through London , and seeing the inside of St. George \u2019s , Hanover Square . Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time : I should not like to be tempted . What a long letter ! one word more . Henry , I find , has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that _ you _ approve ; but this can not possibly be permitted before the middle of next week ; that is , he can not anyhow be spared till after the 14th , for _ we _ have a party that evening . The value of a man like Henry , on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable . He will see the Rushworths , which I own I am not sorry for \u2014 having a little curiosity , and so I think has he \u2014 though he will not acknowledge it . \u201d This was a letter to be run through eagerly , to be read deliberately , to supply matter for much reflection , and to leave everything in greater suspense than ever . The only certainty to be drawn from it was , that nothing decisive had yet taken place . Edmund had not yet spoken . How Miss Crawford really felt , how she meant to act , or might act without or against her meaning ; whether his importance to her were quite what it had been before the last separation ; whether , if lessened , it were likely to lessen more , or to recover itself , were subjects for endless conjecture , and to be thought of on that day and many days to come , without producing any conclusion . The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford , after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits , would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up . She would try to be more ambitious than her heart would allow . She would hesitate , she would tease , she would condition , she would require a great deal , but she would finally accept . This was Fanny \u2019s most frequent expectation . A house in town \u2014 that , she thought , must be impossible . Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford might not ask . The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse . The woman who could speak of him , and speak only of his appearance ! What an unworthy attachment ! To be deriving support from the commendations of Mrs. Fraser ! _ She _ who had known him intimately half a year ! Fanny was ashamed of her . Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr. Crawford and herself , touched her , in comparison , slightly . Whether Mr. Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no concern of hers , though , everything considered , she thought he _ would _ go without delay . That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth , was all in her worst line of conduct , and grossly unkind and ill - judged ; but she hoped _ he _ would not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity . He acknowledged no such inducement , and his sister ought to have given him credit for better feelings than her own . She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving this than she had been before ; and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether , by what had come , and what might come , that her usual readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended . She could not command her attention as she wished . If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin , she thought it very likely , most likely , that he would write to her at all events ; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness ; and till she got rid of this idea , till it gradually wore off , by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more , she was in a most restless , anxious state . At length , a something like composure succeeded . Suspense must be submitted to , and must not be allowed to wear her out , and make her useless . Time did something , her own exertions something more , and she resumed her attentions to Susan , and again awakened the same interest in them . Susan was growing very fond of her , and though without any of the early delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny , with a disposition much less inclined to sedentary pursuits , or to information for information \u2019s sake , she had so strong a desire of not _ appearing _ ignorant , as , with a good clear understanding , made her a most attentive , profitable , thankful pupil . Fanny was her oracle . Fanny \u2019s explanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay , or every chapter of history . What Fanny told her of former times dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith ; and she paid her sister the compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author . The early habit of reading was wanting . Their conversations , however , were not always on subjects so high as history or morals . Others had their hour ; and of lesser matters , none returned so often , or remained so long between them , as Mansfield Park , a description of the people , the manners , the amusements , the ways of Mansfield Park . Susan , who had an innate taste for the genteel and well - appointed , was eager to hear , and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme . She hoped it was not wrong ; though , after a time , Susan \u2019s very great admiration of everything said or done in her uncle \u2019s house , and earnest longing to go into Northamptonshire , seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified . Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister ; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this , she began to feel that when her own release from Portsmouth came , her happiness would have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind . That a girl so capable of being made everything good should be left in such hands , distressed her more and more . Were _ she _ likely to have a home to invite her to , what a blessing it would be ! And had it been possible for her to return Mr. Crawford \u2019s regard , the probability of his being very far from objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her own comforts . She thought he was really good - tempered , and could fancy his entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [13, 15], "text": "Mr. Crawford"},
