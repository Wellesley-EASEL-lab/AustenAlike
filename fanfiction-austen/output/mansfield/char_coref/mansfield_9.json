{"document": "XVIII Everything was now in a regular train : theatre , actors , actresses , and dresses , were all getting forward ; but though no other great impediments arose , Fanny found , before many days were past , that it was not all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves , and that she had not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost too much for her at first . Everybody began to have their vexation . Edmund had many . Entirely against _ his _ judgment , a scene - painter arrived from town , and was at work , much to the increase of the expenses , and , what was worse , of the eclat of their proceedings ; and his brother , instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of the representation , was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way . Tom himself began to fret over the scene - painter \u2019s slow progress , and to feel the miseries of waiting . He had learned his part \u2014 all his parts , for he took every trifling one that could be united with the Butler , and began to be impatient to be acting ; and every day thus unemployed was tending to increase his sense of the insignificance of all his parts together , and make him more ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen . Fanny , being always a very courteous listener , and often the only listener at hand , came in for the complaints and the distresses of most of them . _ She _ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully ; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford ; that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible ; that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing ; that Edmund was behindhand with his part , and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth , who was wanting a prompter through every speech . She knew , also , that poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him : _ his _ complaint came before her as well as the rest ; and so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria \u2019s avoidance of him , and so needlessly often the rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford , that she had soon all the terror of other complaints from _ him _ . So far from being all satisfied and all enjoying , she found everybody requiring something they had not , and giving occasion of discontent to the others . Everybody had a part either too long or too short ; nobody would attend as they ought ; nobody would remember on which side they were to come in ; nobody but the complainer would observe any directions . Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them ; Henry Crawford acted well , and it was a pleasure to _ her _ to creep into the theatre , and attend the rehearsal of the first act , in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria . Maria , she also thought , acted well , too well ; and after the first rehearsal or two , Fanny began to be their only audience ; and sometimes as prompter , sometimes as spectator , was often very useful . As far as she could judge , Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all : he had more confidence than Edmund , more judgment than Tom , more talent and taste than Mr. Yates . She did not like him as a man , but she must admit him to be the best actor , and on this point there were not many who differed from her . Mr. Yates , indeed , exclaimed against his tameness and insipidity ; and the day came at last , when Mr. Rushworth turned to her with a black look , and said , \u201c Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this ? For the life and soul of me , I can not admire him ; and , between ourselves , to see such an undersized , little , mean - looking man , set up for a fine actor , is very ridiculous in my opinion . \u201d From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy , which Maria , from increasing hopes of Crawford , was at little pains to remove ; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s ever attaining to the knowledge of his two - and - forty speeches became much less . As to his ever making anything _ tolerable _ of them , nobody had the smallest idea of that except his mother ; _ she _ , indeed , regretted that his part was not more considerable , and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they were forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes ; but the others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword , and the first line of his speech , and being able to follow the prompter through the rest . Fanny , in her pity and kindheartedness , was at great pains to teach him how to learn , giving him all the helps and directions in her power , trying to make an artificial memory for him , and learning every word of his part herself , but without his being much the forwarder . Many uncomfortable , anxious , apprehensive feelings she certainly had ; but with all these , and other claims on her time and attention , she was as far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them , as without a companion in uneasiness ; quite as far from having no demand on her leisure as on her compassion . The gloom of her first anticipations was proved to have been unfounded . She was occasionally useful to all ; she was perhaps as much at peace as any . There was a great deal of needlework to be done , moreover , in which her help was wanted ; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well off as the rest , was evident by the manner in which she claimed it\u2014\u201cCome , Fanny , \u201d she cried , \u201c these are fine times for you , but you must not be always walking from one room to the other , and doing the lookings - on at your ease , in this way ; I want you here . I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand , to contrive Mr. Rushworth \u2019s cloak without sending for any more satin ; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together . There are but three seams ; you may do them in a trice . It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do . _ You _ are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than _ you _ , we should not get on very fast . \u201d Fanny took the work very quietly , without attempting any defence ; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf \u2014 \u201c One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _ should _ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too . What is the play about , Fanny ? you have never told me . \u201d \u201c Oh ! sister , pray do not ask her now ; for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time . It is about Lovers \u2019 Vows . \u201d \u201c I believe , \u201d said Fanny to her aunt Bertram , \u201c there will be three acts rehearsed to - morrow evening , and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once . \u201d \u201c You had better stay till the curtain is hung , \u201d interposed Mrs. Norris ; \u201c the curtain will be hung in a day or two \u2014 there is very little sense in a play without a curtain \u2014 and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons . \u201d Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting . Fanny did not share her aunt \u2019s composure : she thought of the morrow a great deal , for if the three acts were rehearsed , Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting together for the first time ; the third act would bring a scene between them which interested her most particularly , and which she was longing and dreading to see how they would perform . The whole subject of it was love \u2014 a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman , and very little short of a declaration of love be made by the lady . She had read and read the scene again with many painful , many wondering emotions , and looked forward to their representation of it as a circumstance almost too interesting . She did not _ believe _ they had yet rehearsed it , even in private . The morrow came , the plan for the evening continued , and Fanny \u2019s consideration of it did not become less agitated . She worked very diligently under her aunt \u2019s directions , but her diligence and her silence concealed a very absent , anxious mind ; and about noon she made her escape with her work to the East room , that she might have no concern in another , and , as she deemed it , most unnecessary rehearsal of the first act , which Henry Crawford was just proposing , desirous at once of having her time to herself , and of avoiding the sight of Mr. Rushworth . A glimpse , as she passed through the hall , of the two ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat , and she worked and meditated in the East room , undisturbed , for a quarter of an hour , when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford . \u201c Am I right ? Yes ; this is the East room . My dear Miss Price , I beg your pardon , but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help . \u201d Fanny , quite surprised , endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the room by her civilities , and looked at the bright bars of her empty grate with concern . \u201c Thank you ; I am quite warm , very warm . Allow me to stay here a little while , and do have the goodness to hear me my third act . I have brought my book , and if you would but rehearse it with me , I should be _ so _ obliged ! I came here to - day intending to rehearse it with Edmund \u2014 by ourselves \u2014 against the evening , but he is not in the way ; and if he _ were _ , I do not think I could go through it with _ him _ , till I have hardened myself a little ; for really there is a speech or two . You will be so good , wo n\u2019t you ? \u201d Fanny was most civil in her assurances , though she could not give them in a very steady voice . \u201c Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean ? \u201d continued Miss Crawford , opening her book . \u201c Here it is . I did not think much of it at first \u2014 but , upon my word . There , look at _ that _ speech , and _ that _ , and _ that _ . How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things ? Could you do it ? But then he is your cousin , which makes all the difference . You must rehearse it with me , that I may fancy _ you _ him , and get on by degrees . You _ have _ a look of _ his _ sometimes . \u201d \u201c Have I ? I will do my best with the greatest readiness ; but I must _ read _ the part , for I can say very little of it . \u201d \u201c _ None _ of it , I suppose . You are to have the book , of course . Now for it . We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage . There \u2014 very good school - room chairs , not made for a theatre , I dare say ; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson . What would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose ? Could Sir Thomas look in upon us just now , he would bless himself , for we are rehearsing all over the house . Yates is storming away in the dining - room . I heard him as I came upstairs , and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers , Agatha and Frederick . If _ they _ are not perfect , I _ shall _ be surprised . By the bye , I looked in upon them five minutes ago , and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying _ not _ to embrace , and Mr. Rushworth was with me . I thought he began to look a little queer , so I turned it off as well as I could , by whispering to him , \u2018 We shall have an excellent Agatha ; there is something so _ maternal _ in her manner , so completely _ maternal _ in her voice and countenance . \u2019 Was not that well done of me ? He brightened up directly . Now for my soliloquy . \u201d She began , and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire ; but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man . With such an Anhalt , however , Miss Crawford had courage enough ; and they had got through half the scene , when a tap at the door brought a pause , and the entrance of Edmund , the next moment , suspended it all . Surprise , consciousness , and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting ; and as Edmund was come on the very same business that had brought Miss Crawford , consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in _ them _ . He too had his book , and was seeking Fanny , to ask her to rehearse with him , and help him to prepare for the evening , without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house ; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together , of comparing schemes , and sympathising in praise of Fanny \u2019s kind offices . _ She _ could not equal them in their warmth . _ Her _ spirits sank under the glow of theirs , and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either . They must now rehearse together . Edmund proposed , urged , entreated it , till the lady , not very unwilling at first , could refuse no longer , and Fanny was wanted only to prompt and observe them . She was invested , indeed , with the office of judge and critic , and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults ; but from doing so every feeling within her shrank \u2014 she could not , would not , dared not attempt it : had she been otherwise qualified for criticism , her conscience must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation . She believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars . To prompt them must be enough for her ; and it was sometimes _ more _ than enough ; for she could not always pay attention to the book . In watching them she forgot herself ; and , agitated by the increasing spirit of Edmund \u2019s manner , had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help . It was imputed to very reasonable weariness , and she was thanked and pitied ; but she deserved their pity more than she hoped they would ever surmise . At last the scene was over , and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other ; and when again alone and able to recall the whole , she was inclined to believe their performance would , indeed , have such nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit , and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself . Whatever might be its effect , however , she must stand the brunt of it again that very day . The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly to take place in the evening : Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to return for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner ; and every one concerned was looking forward with eagerness . There seemed a general diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion . Tom was enjoying such an advance towards the end ; Edmund was in spirits from the morning \u2019s rehearsal , and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away . All were alert and impatient ; the ladies moved soon , the gentlemen soon followed them , and with the exception of Lady Bertram , Mrs. Norris , and Julia , everybody was in the theatre at an early hour ; and having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted , were waiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin . They did not wait long for the Crawfords , but there was no Mrs. Grant . She could not come . Dr. Grant , professing an indisposition , for which he had little credit with his fair sister - in - law , could not spare his wife . \u201c Dr. Grant is ill , \u201d said she , with mock solemnity . \u201c He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today . He fancied it tough , sent away his plate , and has been suffering ever since \u201d . Here was disappointment ! Mrs. Grant \u2019s non - attendance was sad indeed . Her pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her always valuable amongst them ; but _ now _ she was absolutely necessary . They could not act , they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her . The comfort of the whole evening was destroyed . What was to be done ? Tom , as Cottager , was in despair . After a pause of perplexity , some eyes began to be turned towards Fanny , and a voice or two to say , \u201c If Miss Price would be so good as to _ read _ the part . \u201d She was immediately surrounded by supplications ; everybody asked it ; even Edmund said , \u201c Do , Fanny , if it is not _ very _ disagreeable to you . \u201d But Fanny still hung back . She could not endure the idea of it . Why was not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well ? Or why had not she rather gone to her own room , as she had felt to be safest , instead of attending the rehearsal at all ? She had known it would irritate and distress her ; she had known it her duty to keep away . She was properly punished . \u201c You have only to _ read _ the part , \u201d said Henry Crawford , with renewed entreaty . \u201c And I do believe she can say every word of it , \u201d added Maria , \u201c for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places . Fanny , I am sure you know the part . \u201d Fanny could not say she did _ not _ ; and as they all persevered , as Edmund repeated his wish , and with a look of even fond dependence on her good - nature , she must yield . She would do her best . Everybody was satisfied ; and she was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart , while the others prepared to begin . They _ did _ begin ; and being too much engaged in their own noise to be struck by an unusual noise in the other part of the house , had proceeded some way when the door of the room was thrown open , and Julia , appearing at it , with a face all aghast , exclaimed , \u201c My father is come ! He is in the hall at this moment . \u201d XIX How is the consternation of the party to be described ? To the greater number it was a moment of absolute horror . Sir Thomas in the house ! All felt the instantaneous conviction . Not a hope of imposition or mistake was harboured anywhere . Julia \u2019s looks were an evidence of the fact that made it indisputable ; and after the first starts and exclamations , not a word was spoken for half a minute : each with an altered countenance was looking at some other , and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most unwelcome , most ill - timed , most appalling ! Mr. Yates might consider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening , and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a blessing ; but every other heart was sinking under some degree of self - condemnation or undefined alarm , every other heart was suggesting , \u201c What will become of us ? what is to be done now ? \u201d It was a terrible pause ; and terrible to every ear were the corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps . Julia was the first to move and speak again . Jealousy and bitterness had been suspended : selfishness was lost in the common cause ; but at the moment of her appearance , Frederick was listening with looks of devotion to Agatha \u2019s narrative , and pressing her hand to his heart ; and as soon as she could notice this , and see that , in spite of the shock of her words , he still kept his station and retained her sister \u2019s hand , her wounded heart swelled again with injury , and looking as red as she had been white before , she turned out of the room , saying , \u201c _ I _ need not be afraid of appearing before him . \u201d Her going roused the rest ; and at the same moment the two brothers stepped forward , feeling the necessity of doing something . A very few words between them were sufficient . The case admitted no difference of opinion : they must go to the drawing - room directly . Maria joined them with the same intent , just then the stoutest of the three ; for the very circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest support . Henry Crawford \u2019s retaining her hand at such a moment , a moment of such peculiar proof and importance , was worth ages of doubt and anxiety . She hailed it as an earnest of the most serious determination , and was equal even to encounter her father . They walked off , utterly heedless of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s repeated question of , \u201c Shall I go too ? Had not I better go too ? Will not it be right for me to go too ? \u201d but they were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry , and , encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay , sent him after the others with delighted haste . Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates . She had been quite overlooked by her cousins ; and as her own opinion of her claims on Sir Thomas \u2019s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing herself with his children , she was glad to remain behind and gain a little breathing - time . Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest , by the right of a disposition which not even innocence could keep from suffering . She was nearly fainting : all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning , and with it compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the development before him , with solicitude on Edmund \u2019s account indescribable . She had found a seat , where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts , while the other three , no longer under any restraint , were giving vent to their feelings of vexation , lamenting over such an unlooked - for premature arrival as a most untoward event , and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage , or were still in Antigua . The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates , from better understanding the family , and judging more clearly of the mischief that must ensue . The ruin of the play was to them a certainty : they felt the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand ; while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption , a disaster for the evening , and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea , when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over , and he might be at leisure to be amused by it . The Crawfords laughed at the idea ; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves , proposed Mr. Yates \u2019s accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage . But Mr. Yates , having never been with those who thought much of parental claims , or family confidence , could not perceive that anything of the kind was necessary ; and therefore , thanking them , said , \u201c he preferred remaining where he was , that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he _ was _ come ; and besides , he did not think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away . \u201d Fanny was just beginning to collect herself , and to feel that if she staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful , when this point was settled , and being commissioned with the brother and sister \u2019s apology , saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the dreadful duty of appearing before her uncle . Too soon did she find herself at the drawing - room door ; and after pausing a moment for what she knew would not come , for a courage which the outside of no door had ever supplied to her , she turned the lock in desperation , and the lights of the drawing - room , and all the collected family , were before her . As she entered , her own name caught her ear . Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him , and saying , \u201c But where is Fanny ? Why do not I see my little Fanny?\u201d\u2014and on perceiving her , came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her , calling her his dear Fanny , kissing her affectionately , and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown ! Fanny knew not how to feel , nor where to look . She was quite oppressed . He had never been so kind , so _ very _ kind to her in his life . His manner seemed changed , his voice was quick from the agitation of joy ; and all that had been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness . He led her nearer the light and looked at her again \u2014 inquired particularly after her health , and then , correcting himself , observed that he need not inquire , for her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point . A fine blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face , he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty . He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him . Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party , who at his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire . He had the best right to be the talker ; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house , in the centre of his family , after such a separation , made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree ; and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage , and answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put . His business in Antigua had latterly been prosperously rapid , and he came directly from Liverpool , having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel , instead of waiting for the packet ; and all the little particulars of his proceedings and events , his arrivals and departures , were most promptly delivered , as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him \u2014 interrupting himself more than once , however , to remark on his good fortune in finding them all at home \u2014 coming unexpectedly as he did \u2014 all collected together exactly as he could have wished , but dared not depend on . Mr. Rushworth was not forgotten : a most friendly reception and warmth of hand - shaking had already met him , and with pointed attention he was now included in the objects most intimately connected with Mansfield . There was nothing disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth \u2019s appearance , and Sir Thomas was liking him already . By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken , unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife , who was really extremely happy to see him , and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years . She had been _ almost _ fluttered for a few minutes , and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away her work , move Pug from her side , and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband . She had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _ her _ pleasure : her own time had been irreproachably spent during his absence : she had done a great deal of carpet - work , and made many yards of fringe ; and she would have answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the young people as for her own . It was so agreeable to her to see him again , and hear him talk , to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives , that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she must have missed him , and how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened absence . Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister . Not that _ she _ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas \u2019s disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known , for her judgment had been so blinded that , except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth \u2019s pink satin cloak as her brother - in - law entered , she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm ; but she was vexed by the _ manner _ of his return . It had left her nothing to do . Instead of being sent for out of the room , and seeing him first , and having to spread the happy news through the house , Sir Thomas , with a very reasonable dependence , perhaps , on the nerves of his wife and children , had sought no confidant but the butler , and had been following him almost instantaneously into the drawing - room . Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended , whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded ; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about , and labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and silence . Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat , she might have gone to the housekeeper with troublesome directions , and insulted the footmen with injunctions of despatch ; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner : he would take nothing , nothing till tea came \u2014 he would rather wait for tea . Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different ; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England , when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height , she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup . \u201c Sure , my dear Sir Thomas , a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea . Do have a basin of soup . \u201d Sir Thomas could not be provoked . \u201c Still the same anxiety for everybody \u2019s comfort , my dear Mrs. Norris , \u201d was his answer . \u201c But indeed I would rather have nothing but tea . \u201d \u201c Well , then , Lady Bertram , suppose you speak for tea directly ; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little ; he seems behindhand to - night . \u201d She carried this point , and Sir Thomas \u2019s narrative proceeded . At length there was a pause . His immediate communications were exhausted , and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him , now at one , now at another of the beloved circle ; but the pause was not long : in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative , and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say , \u201c How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir Thomas ? They have been acting . We have been all alive with acting . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! and what have you been acting ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! they \u2019ll tell you all about it . \u201d \u201c The _ all _ will soon be told , \u201d cried Tom hastily , and with affected unconcern ; \u201c but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now . You will hear enough of it to - morrow , sir . We have just been trying , by way of doing something , and amusing my mother , just within the last week , to get up a few scenes , a mere trifle . We have had such incessant rains almost since October began , that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together . I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd . Tolerable sport the first three days , but there has been no attempting anything since . The first day I went over Mansfield Wood , and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton , and we brought home six brace between us , and might each have killed six times as many , but we respect your pheasants , sir , I assure you , as much as you could desire . I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were . _ I _ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year . I hope you will take a day \u2019s sport there yourself , sir , soon . \u201d For the present the danger was over , and Fanny \u2019s sick feelings subsided ; but when tea was soon afterwards brought in , and Sir Thomas , getting up , said that he found that he could not be any longer in the house without just looking into his own dear room , every agitation was returning . He was gone before anything had been said to prepare him for the change he must find there ; and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance . Edmund was the first to speak \u2014 \u201c Something must be done , \u201d said he . \u201c It is time to think of our visitors , \u201d said Maria , still feeling her hand pressed to Henry Crawford \u2019s heart , and caring little for anything else . \u201c Where did you leave Miss Crawford , Fanny ? \u201d Fanny told of their departure , and delivered their message . \u201c Then poor Yates is all alone , \u201d cried Tom . \u201c I will go and fetch him . He will be no bad assistant when it all comes out . \u201d To the theatre he went , and reached it just in time to witness the first meeting of his father and his friend . Sir Thomas had been a good deal surprised to find candles burning in his room ; and on casting his eye round it , to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air of confusion in the furniture . The removal of the bookcase from before the billiard - room door struck him especially , but he had scarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this , before there were sounds from the billiard - room to astonish him still farther . Some one was talking there in a very loud accent ; he did not know the voice \u2014 more than talking \u2014 almost hallooing . He stepped to the door , rejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate communication , and , opening it , found himself on the stage of a theatre , and opposed to a ranting young man , who appeared likely to knock him down backwards . At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir Thomas , and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals , Tom Bertram entered at the other end of the room ; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his countenance . His father \u2019s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his first appearance on any stage , and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well - bred and easy Mr. Yates , making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram , was such an exhibition , such a piece of true acting , as he would not have lost upon any account . It would be the last \u2014 in all probability \u2014 the last scene on that stage ; but he was sure there could not be a finer . The house would close with the greatest eclat . There was little time , however , for the indulgence of any images of merriment . It was necessary for him to step forward , too , and assist the introduction , and with many awkward sensations he did his best . Sir Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which was due to his own character , but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement . Mr. Yates \u2019s family and connexions were sufficiently known to him to render his introduction as the \u201c particular friend , \u201d another of the hundred particular friends of his son , exceedingly unwelcome ; and it needed all the felicity of being again at home , and all the forbearance it could supply , to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus bewildered in his own house , making part of a ridiculous exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense , and forced in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving , and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two . Tom understood his father \u2019s thoughts , and heartily wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them but partial expression , began to see , more clearly than he had ever done before , that there might be some ground of offence , that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room ; and that when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard - table , he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity . A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side ; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates , as to the happiness of the arrangement , the three gentlemen returned to the drawing - room together , Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not lost on all . \u201c I come from your theatre , \u201d said he composedly , as he sat down ; \u201c I found myself in it rather unexpectedly . Its vicinity to my own room \u2014 but in every respect , indeed , it took me by surprise , as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character . It appears a neat job , however , as far as I could judge by candlelight , and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit . \u201d And then he would have changed the subject , and sipped his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer hue ; but Mr. Yates , without discernment to catch Sir Thomas \u2019s meaning , or diffidence , or delicacy , or discretion enough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others with the least obtrusiveness himself , would keep him on the topic of the theatre , would torment him with questions and remarks relative to it , and finally would make him hear the whole history of his disappointment at Ecclesford . Sir Thomas listened most politely , but found much to offend his ideas of decorum , and confirm his ill - opinion of Mr. Yates \u2019s habits of thinking , from the beginning to the end of the story ; and when it was over , could give him no other assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed . \u201c This was , in fact , the origin of _ our _ acting , \u201d said Tom , after a moment \u2019s thought . \u201c My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford , and it spread \u2014 as those things always spread , you know , sir \u2014 the faster , probably , from _ your _ having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly . It was like treading old ground again . \u201d Mr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible , and immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were doing : told him of the gradual increase of their views , the happy conclusion of their first difficulties , and present promising state of affairs ; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him not only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his friends as they sat , the change of countenance , the fidget , the hem ! of unquietness , but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the face on which his own eyes were fixed \u2014 from seeing Sir Thomas \u2019s dark brow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters and Edmund , dwelling particularly on the latter , and speaking a language , a remonstrance , a reproof , which _ he _ felt at his heart . Not less acutely was it felt by Fanny , who had edged back her chair behind her aunt \u2019s end of the sofa , and , screened from notice herself , saw all that was passing before her . Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his father she could never have expected to witness ; and to feel that it was in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed . Sir Thomas \u2019s look implied , \u201c On your judgment , Edmund , I depended ; what have you been about ? \u201d She knelt in spirit to her uncle , and her bosom swelled to utter , \u201c Oh , not to _ him _ ! Look so to all the others , but not to _ him _ ! \u201d Mr. Yates was still talking . \u201c To own the truth , Sir Thomas , we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening . We were going through the three first acts , and not unsuccessfully upon the whole . Our company is now so dispersed , from the Crawfords being gone home , that nothing more can be done to - night ; but if you will give us the honour of your company to - morrow evening , I should not be afraid of the result . We bespeak your indulgence , you understand , as young performers ; we bespeak your indulgence . \u201d \u201c My indulgence shall be given , sir , \u201d replied Sir Thomas gravely , \u201c but without any other rehearsal . \u201d And with a relenting smile , he added , \u201c I come home to be happy and indulgent . \u201d Then turning away towards any or all of the rest , he tranquilly said , \u201c Mr. and Miss Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield . Do you find them agreeable acquaintance ? \u201d Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer , but he being entirely without particular regard for either , without jealousy either in love or acting , could speak very handsomely of both . \u201c Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant , gentleman - like man ; his sister a sweet , pretty , elegant , lively girl . \u201d Mr. Rushworth could be silent no longer . \u201c I do not say he is not gentleman - like , considering ; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight , or he will be expecting a well - looking man . \u201d Sir Thomas did not quite understand this , and looked with some surprise at the speaker . \u201c If I must say what I think , \u201d continued Mr. Rushworth , \u201c in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing . It is having too much of a good thing . I am not so fond of acting as I was at first . I think we are a great deal better employed , sitting comfortably here among ourselves , and doing nothing . \u201d Sir Thomas looked again , and then replied with an approving smile , \u201c I am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same . It gives me sincere satisfaction . That I should be cautious and quick - sighted , and feel many scruples which my children do _ not _ feel , is perfectly natural ; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity , for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures , should much exceed theirs . But at your time of life to feel all this , is a most favourable circumstance for yourself , and for everybody connected with you ; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight . \u201d Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth \u2019s opinion in better words than he could find himself . He was aware that he must not expect a genius in Mr. Rushworth ; but as a well - judging , steady young man , with better notions than his elocution would do justice to , he intended to value him very highly . It was impossible for many of the others not to smile . Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning ; but by looking , as he really felt , most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas \u2019s good opinion , and saying scarcely anything , he did his best towards preserving that good opinion a little longer .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [31, 32], "text": "Fanny"}, {"position": [54, 55], "text": "she"}, {"position": [73, 74],
