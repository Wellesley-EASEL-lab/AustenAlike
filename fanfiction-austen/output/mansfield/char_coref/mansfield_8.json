{"document": "XVI It was not in Miss Crawford \u2019s power to talk Fanny into any real forgetfulness of what had passed . When the evening was over , she went to bed full of it , her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack from her cousin Tom , so public and so persevered in , and her spirits sinking under her aunt \u2019s unkind reflection and reproach . To be called into notice in such a manner , to hear that it was but the prelude to something so infinitely worse , to be told that she must do what was so impossible as to act ; and then to have the charge of obstinacy and ingratitude follow it , enforced with such a hint at the dependence of her situation , had been too distressing at the time to make the remembrance when she was alone much less so , especially with the superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation of the subject . Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time ; and if she were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of , and Edmund perhaps away , what should she do ? She fell asleep before she could answer the question , and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the next morning . The little white attic , which had continued her sleeping - room ever since her first entering the family , proving incompetent to suggest any reply , she had recourse , as soon as she was dressed , to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking about in and thinking , and of which she had now for some time been almost equally mistress . It had been their school - room ; so called till the Miss Bertrams would not allow it to be called so any longer , and inhabited as such to a later period . There Miss Lee had lived , and there they had read and written , and talked and laughed , till within the last three years , when she had quitted them . The room had then become useless , and for some time was quite deserted , except by Fanny , when she visited her plants , or wanted one of the books , which she was still glad to keep there , from the deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above : but gradually , as her value for the comforts of it increased , she had added to her possessions , and spent more of her time there ; and having nothing to oppose her , had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it , that it was now generally admitted to be hers . The East room , as it had been called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen , was now considered Fanny \u2019s , almost as decidedly as the white attic : the smallness of the one making the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams , with every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of superiority could demand , were entirely approving it ; and Mrs. Norris , having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny \u2019s account , was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody else wanted , though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house . The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable in many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind as Fanny \u2019s ; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be driven from it entirely , even when winter came . The comfort of it in her hours of leisure was extreme . She could go there after anything unpleasant below , and find immediate consolation in some pursuit , or some train of thought at hand . Her plants , her books \u2014 of which she had been a collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling \u2014 her writing - desk , and her works of charity and ingenuity , were all within her reach ; or if indisposed for employment , if nothing but musing would do , she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an interesting remembrance connected with it . Everything was a friend , or bore her thoughts to a friend ; and though there had been sometimes much of suffering to her ; though her motives had often been misunderstood , her feelings disregarded , and her comprehension undervalued ; though she had known the pains of tyranny , of ridicule , and neglect , yet almost every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory : her aunt Bertram had spoken for her , or Miss Lee had been encouraging , or , what was yet more frequent or more dear , Edmund had been her champion and her friend : he had supported her cause or explained her meaning , he had told her not to cry , or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears delightful ; and the whole was now so blended together , so harmonised by distance , that every former affliction had its charm . The room was most dear to her , and she would not have changed its furniture for the handsomest in the house , though what had been originally plain had suffered all the ill - usage of children ; and its greatest elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia \u2019s work , too ill done for the drawing - room , three transparencies , made in a rage for transparencies , for the three lower panes of one window , where Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in Cumberland , a collection of family profiles , thought unworthy of being anywhere else , over the mantelpiece , and by their side , and pinned against the wall , a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William , with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom , in letters as tall as the mainmast . To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on an agitated , doubting spirit , to see if by looking at Edmund \u2019s profile she could catch any of his counsel , or by giving air to her geraniums she might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself . But she had more than fears of her own perseverance to remove : she had begun to feel undecided as to what she _ ought _ _ to _ _ do _ ; and as she walked round the room her doubts were increasing . Was she _ right _ in refusing what was so warmly asked , so strongly wished for \u2014 what might be so essential to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest complaisance had set their hearts ? Was it not ill - nature , selfishness , and a fear of exposing herself ? And would Edmund \u2019s judgment , would his persuasion of Sir Thomas \u2019s disapprobation of the whole , be enough to justify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest ? It would be so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of her own scruples ; and as she looked around her , the claims of her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present upon present that she had received from them . The table between the windows was covered with work - boxes and netting - boxes which had been given her at different times , principally by Tom ; and she grew bewildered as to the amount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced . A tap at the door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to her duty , and her gentle \u201c Come in \u201d was answered by the appearance of one , before whom all her doubts were wo nt to be laid . Her eyes brightened at the sight of Edmund . \u201c Can I speak with you , Fanny , for a few minutes ? \u201d said he . \u201c Yes , certainly . \u201d \u201c I want to consult . I want your opinion . \u201d \u201c My opinion ! \u201d she cried , shrinking from such a compliment , highly as it gratified her . \u201c Yes , your advice and opinion . I do not know what to do . This acting scheme gets worse and worse , you see . They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could , and now , to complete the business , are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us . This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first . I know no harm of Charles Maddox ; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable , the _ more _ than intimacy \u2014 the familiarity . I can not think of it with any patience ; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must , _ if _ _ possible _ , be prevented . Do not you see it in the same light ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; but what can be done ? Your brother is so determined . \u201d \u201c There is but _ one _ thing to be done , Fanny . I must take Anhalt myself . I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom . \u201d Fanny could not answer him . \u201c It is not at all what I like , \u201d he continued . \u201c No man can like being driven into the _ appearance _ of such inconsistency . After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning , there is absurdity in the face of my joining them _ now _ , when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect ; but I can think of no other alternative . Can you , Fanny ? \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said Fanny slowly , \u201c not immediately , but \u2014 \u201d \u201c But what ? I see your judgment is not with me . Think it a little over . Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that _ may _ , of the unpleasantness that _ must _ arise from a young man \u2019s being received in this manner : domesticated among us ; authorised to come at all hours , and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints . To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create . It is all very bad ! Put yourself in Miss Crawford \u2019s place , Fanny . Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger . She has a right to be felt for , because she evidently feels for herself . I heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger ; and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations \u2014 perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be \u2014 it would be ungenerous , it would be really wrong to expose her to it . Her feelings ought to be respected . Does it not strike you so , Fanny ? You hesitate . \u201d \u201c I am sorry for Miss Crawford ; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against , and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle . It will be such a triumph to the others ! \u201d \u201c They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously I act . But , however , triumph there certainly will be , and I must brave it . But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business , of limiting the exhibition , of concentrating our folly , I shall be well repaid . As I am now , I have no influence , I can do nothing : I have offended them , and they will not hear me ; but when I have put them in good - humour by this concession , I am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for . This will be a material gain . My object is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants . Will not this be worth gaining ? \u201d \u201c Yes , it will be a great point . \u201d \u201c But still it has not your approbation . Can you mention any other measure by which I have a chance of doing equal good ? \u201d \u201c No , I can not think of anything else . \u201d \u201c Give me your approbation , then , Fanny . I am not comfortable without it . \u201d \u201c Oh , cousin ! \u201d \u201c If you are against me , I ought to distrust myself , and yet \u2014 But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act \u2014 no matter whom : the look of a gentleman is to be enough . I thought _ you _ would have entered more into Miss Crawford \u2019s feelings . \u201d \u201c No doubt she will be very glad . It must be a great relief to her , \u201d said Fanny , trying for greater warmth of manner . \u201c She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night . It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill . \u201d \u201c She _ was _ very kind , indeed , and I am glad to have her spared \u201d ... She could not finish the generous effusion . Her conscience stopt her in the middle , but Edmund was satisfied . \u201c I shall walk down immediately after breakfast , \u201d said he , \u201c and am sure of giving pleasure there . And now , dear Fanny , I will not interrupt you any longer . You want to be reading . But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you , and come to a decision . Sleeping or waking , my head has been full of this matter all night . It is an evil , but I am certainly making it less than it might be . If Tom is up , I shall go to him directly and get it over , and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good - humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity . _ You _ , in the meanwhile , will be taking a trip into China , I suppose . How does Lord Macartney go on?\u201d\u2014opening a volume on the table and then taking up some others . \u201c And here are Crabbe \u2019s Tales , and the Idler , at hand to relieve you , if you tire of your great book . I admire your little establishment exceedingly ; and as soon as I am gone , you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting , and sit comfortably down to your table . But do not stay here to be cold . \u201d He went ; but there was no reading , no China , no composure for Fanny . He had told her the most extraordinary , the most inconceivable , the most unwelcome news ; and she could think of nothing else . To be acting ! After all his objections \u2014 objections so just and so public ! After all that she had heard him say , and seen him look , and known him to be feeling . Could it be possible ? Edmund so inconsistent ! Was he not deceiving himself ? Was he not wrong ? Alas ! it was all Miss Crawford \u2019s doing . She had seen her influence in every speech , and was miserable . The doubts and alarms as to her own conduct , which had previously distressed her , and which had all slept while she listened to him , were become of little consequence now . This deeper anxiety swallowed them up . Things should take their course ; she cared not how it ended . Her cousins might attack , but could hardly tease her . She was beyond their reach ; and if at last obliged to yield \u2014 no matter \u2014 it was all misery now . XVII It was , indeed , a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria . Such a victory over Edmund \u2019s discretion had been beyond their hopes , and was most delightful . There was no longer anything to disturb them in their darling project , and they congratulated each other in private on the jealous weakness to which they attributed the change , with all the glee of feelings gratified in every way . Edmund might still look grave , and say he did not like the scheme in general , and must disapprove the play in particular ; their point was gained : he was to act , and he was driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only . Edmund had descended from that moral elevation which he had maintained before , and they were both as much the better as the happier for the descent . They behaved very well , however , to _ him _ on the occasion , betraying no exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth , and seemed to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles Maddox , as if they had been forced into admitting him against their inclination . \u201c To have it quite in their own family circle was what they had particularly wished . A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort \u201d ; and when Edmund , pursuing that idea , gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience , they were ready , in the complaisance of the moment , to promise anything . It was all good - humour and encouragement . Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his dress , Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt \u2019s last scene with the Baron admitted a good deal of action and emphasis , and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his speeches . \u201c Perhaps , \u201d said Tom , \u201c Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now . Perhaps you may persuade _ her _ . \u201d \u201c No , she is quite determined . She certainly will not act . \u201d \u201c Oh ! very well . \u201d And not another word was said ; but Fanny felt herself again in danger , and her indifference to the danger was beginning to fail her already . There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this change in Edmund ; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers , and entered with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole affair as could have but one effect on him . \u201c He was certainly right in respecting such feelings ; he was glad he had determined on it . \u201d And the morning wore away in satisfactions very sweet , if not very sound . One advantage resulted from it to Fanny : at the earnest request of Miss Crawford , Mrs. Grant had , with her usual good - humour , agreed to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted ; and this was all that occurred to gladden _ her _ heart during the day ; and even this , when imparted by Edmund , brought a pang with it , for it was Miss Crawford to whom she was obliged \u2014 it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to excite her gratitude , and whose merit in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration . She was safe ; but peace and safety were unconnected here . Her mind had been never farther from peace . She could not feel that she had done wrong herself , but she was disquieted in every other way . Her heart and her judgment were equally against Edmund \u2019s decision : she could not acquit his unsteadiness , and his happiness under it made her wretched . She was full of jealousy and agitation . Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an insult , with friendly expressions towards herself which she could hardly answer calmly . Everybody around her was gay and busy , prosperous and important ; each had their object of interest , their part , their dress , their favourite scene , their friends and confederates : all were finding employment in consultations and comparisons , or diversion in the playful conceits they suggested . She alone was sad and insignificant : she had no share in anything ; she might go or stay ; she might be in the midst of their noise , or retreat from it to the solitude of the East room , without being seen or missed . She could almost think anything would have been preferable to this . Mrs. Grant was of consequence : _ her _ good - nature had honourable mention ; her taste and her time were considered ; her presence was wanted ; she was sought for , and attended , and praised ; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted . But reflection brought better feelings , and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect , which could never have belonged to _ her _ ; and that , had she received even the greatest , she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which , considering only her uncle , she must condemn altogether . Fanny \u2019s heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them , as she soon began to acknowledge to herself . Julia was a sufferer too , though not quite so blamelessly . Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings ; but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions , with a jealousy of her sister so reasonable as ought to have been their cure ; and now that the conviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her , she submitted to it without any alarm for Maria \u2019s situation , or any endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself . She either sat in gloomy silence , wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue , no curiosity touch , no wit amuse ; or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates , was talking with forced gaiety to him alone , and ridiculing the acting of the others . For a day or two after the affront was given , Henry Crawford had endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment , but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a few repulses ; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one flirtation , he grew indifferent to the quarrel , or rather thought it a lucky occurrence , as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant . She was not pleased to see Julia excluded from the play , and sitting by disregarded ; but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness , as Henry must be the best judge of his own , and as he did assure her , with a most persuasive smile , that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each other , she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister , entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there , and then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general , and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her . \u201c I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , \u201d was her observation to Mary . \u201c I dare say she is , \u201d replied Mary coldly . \u201c I imagine both sisters are . \u201d \u201c Both ! no , no , that must not be . Do not give him a hint of it . Think of Mr. Rushworth ! \u201d \u201c You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth . It may do _ her _ some good . I often think of Mr. Rushworth \u2019s property and independence , and wish them in other hands ; but I never think of him . A man might represent the county with such an estate ; a man might escape a profession and represent the county . \u201d \u201c I dare say he _ will _ be in parliament soon . When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet . \u201d \u201c Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , \u201d said Mary , after a pause . \u201c Do you remember Hawkins Browne \u2019s \u2018 Address to Tobacco , \u2019 in imitation of Pope ? \u2014 Blest leaf ! whose aromatic gales dispense To Templars modesty , to Parsons sense . I will parody them \u2014 Blest Knight ! whose dictatorial looks dispense To Children affluence , to Rushworth sense . Will not that do , Mrs. Grant ? Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas \u2019s return . \u201d \u201c You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you . I do not think we do so well without him . He has a fine dignified manner , which suits the head of such a house , and keeps everybody in their place . Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order . But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry . I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends , I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . \u201d \u201c I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth \u2019s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . \u201d \u201c If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . \u201d Julia _ did _ suffer , however , though Mrs. Grant discerned it not , and though it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise . She had loved , she did love still , and she had all the suffering which a warm temper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment of a dear , though irrational hope , with a strong sense of ill - usage . Her heart was sore and angry , and she was capable only of angry consolations . The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy : they were alienated from each other ; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there , some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth . With no material fault of temper , or difference of opinion , to prevent their being very good friends while their interests were the same , the sisters , under such a trial as this , had not affection or principle enough to make them merciful or just , to give them honour or compassion . Maria felt her triumph , and pursued her purpose , careless of Julia ; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawford without trusting that it would create jealousy , and bring a public disturbance at last . Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia ; but there was no outward fellowship between them . Julia made no communication , and Fanny took no liberties . They were two solitary sufferers , or connected only by Fanny \u2019s consciousness . The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia \u2019s discomposure , and their blindness to its true cause , must be imputed to the fullness of their own minds . They were totally preoccupied . Tom was engrossed by the concerns of his theatre , and saw nothing that did not immediately relate to it . Edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between Miss Crawford \u2019s claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company , superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her , and saving , with delighted integrity , half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas , to have leisure for watching the behaviour , or guarding the happiness of his daughters .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position":
