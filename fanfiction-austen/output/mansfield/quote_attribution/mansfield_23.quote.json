I have told you the substance of all that she said . As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it . That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now . And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . She was astonished , exceedingly astonished \u2014 more than astonished . I saw her change countenance . She turned extremely red . I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it . She would have laughed if she could . It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , \u2018 A pretty good lecture , upon my word . Was it part of your last sermon ? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . \u2019 She tried to speak carelessly , but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . \u2018 Mr. Bertram , \u2019 said she . I looked back . \u2018 Mr. Bertram , \u2019 said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! Equally in brother and sister deceived ! I thank you for your patience , Fanny .
