It was curious , very curious , that we should have such a scene to play ! If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence , it should be that week \u2014 that acting week . Say what you would , Fanny , it should be _ that _ ; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other . His sturdy spirit to bend as it did ! Oh ! it was sweet beyond expression .

Thinking , I hope , of one who is always thinking of you . Oh ! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town , that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there ! Oh ! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens ; the wonder , the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done ! For as to secrecy , Henry is quite the hero of an old romance , and glories in his chains . You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest . If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . Oh ! she has been trying for him to such a degree . Innocent and quiet as you sit here , you can not have an idea of the _ sensation _ that you will be occasioning , of the curiosity there will be to see you , of the endless questions I shall have to answer ! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth , and how you do your hair , and who makes your shoes . I wish Margaret were married , for my poor friend \u2019s sake , for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people . And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time . We were all delighted . She could not do otherwise than accept him , for he was rich , and she had nothing ; but he turns out ill - tempered and _ exigeant _ , and wants a young woman , a beautiful young woman of five - and - twenty , to be as steady as himself . And my friend does not manage him well ; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it . There is a spirit of irritation which , to say nothing worse , is certainly very ill - bred . In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect . Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister , and a certain consideration for her judgment , which makes one feel there _ is _ attachment ; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers . I shall be at Mansfield for ever , Fanny . My own sister as a wife , Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband , are my standards of perfection . Poor Janet has been sadly taken in , and yet there was nothing improper on her side : she did not run into the match inconsiderately ; there was no want of foresight . She took three days to consider of his proposals , and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having , and especially applied to my late dear aunt , whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance , and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser . This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort . I have not so much to say for my friend Flora , who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway , who has about as much sense , Fanny , as Mr. Rushworth , but much worse - looking , and with a blackguard character . I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong . By the bye , Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out . But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference . But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? No , no , I see you are not . \u201d"}, {"position": [2711, 2838], "text": "Excellent creature ! I will not tease you . Everything shall take its course . But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies .

Was not he devoted to you at the ball ? And then before the ball , the necklace ! Oh ! you received it just as it was meant . You were as conscious as heart could desire .

As to your brother \u2019s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me . I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn . I was quiet , but I was not blind .
