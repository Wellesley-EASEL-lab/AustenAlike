Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time : I should not like to be tempted . What a long letter ! one word more . Henry , I find , has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that _ you _ approve ; but this can not possibly be permitted before the middle of next week ; that is , he can not anyhow be spared till after the 14th , for _ we _ have a party that evening . The value of a man like Henry , on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable .

This , as well as I understand , is to be the substance of my information . He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love . I have not time for writing much , but it would be out of place if I had , for this is to be a mere letter of business , penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information , which could not be delayed without risk of evil . My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you ! You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . I have no news for you . You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time . I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin \u2019s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long ago ; suffice it , that everything was just as it ought to be , in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness , and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit . My friend , Mrs. Fraser , is mad for such a house , and it would not make _ me _ miserable . I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter ; she seems in high spirits , and very happy . I fancy Lord S. is very good - humoured and pleasant in his own family , and I do not think him so very ill - looking as I did \u2014 at least , one sees many worse . He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund . Of the last - mentioned hero , what shall I say ? If I avoided his name entirely , it would look suspicious . I will say , then , that we have seen him two or three times , and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance . Mrs. Fraser ( no bad judge ) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person , height , and air ; and I must confess , when he dined here the other day , there were none to compare with him , and we were a party of sixteen . Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales , but \u2014 but \u2014 but Yours affectionately . \u201d \u201c"}]}
