{"Fanny": [{"position": [76, 1777], "text": "My Dear Fanny,\u2014Excuse me that I have not written before . Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me , but I found it impossible to write from London , and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence . Could I have sent a few happy lines , they should not have been wanting , but nothing of that nature was ever in my power . I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it . My hopes are much weaker . You are probably aware of this already . So very fond of you as Miss Crawford is , it is most natural that she should tell you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine . I will not be prevented , however , from making my own communication . Our confidences in you need not clash . I ask no questions . There is something soothing in the idea that we have the same friend , and that whatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us , we are united in our love of you . It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are , and what are my present plans , if plans I can be said to have . I have been returned since Saturday . I was three weeks in London , and saw her ( for London ) very often . I had every attention from the Frasers that could be reasonably expected . I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield . It was her manner , however , rather than any unfrequency of meeting . Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered : my first reception was so unlike what I had hoped , that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly . I need not particularise . You know the weak side of her character , and may imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me . She was in high spirits , and surrounded by those who were giving all the support of their own bad sense to her too lively mind . I do not like Mrs. Fraser . She is a cold - hearted , vain woman , who has married entirely from convenience , and though evidently unhappy in her marriage , places her disappointment not to faults of judgment , or temper , or disproportion of age , but to her being , after all , less affluent than many of her acquaintance , especially than her sister , Lady Stornaway , and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious , provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough . I look upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine . They have been leading her astray for years . Could she be detached from them!\u2014and sometimes I do not despair of it , for the affection appears to me principally on their side . They are very fond of her ; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you . When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . I can not give her up , Fanny . She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife . If I did not believe that she had some regard for me , of course I should not say this , but I do believe it . I am convinced that she is not without a decided preference . I have no jealousy of any individual . It is the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of . It is the habits of wealth that I fear . Her ideas are not higher than her own fortune may warrant , but they are beyond what our incomes united could authorise . There is comfort , however , even here . I could better bear to lose her because not rich enough , than because of my profession . That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices , which , in fact , I am scarcely justified in asking ; and , if I am refused , that , I think , will be the honest motive . Her prejudices , I trust , are not so strong as they were . You have my thoughts exactly as they arise , my dear Fanny ; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory , but it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind . Having once begun , it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel . I can not give her up . Connected as we already are , and , I hope , are to be , to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom , under any other distress , I should turn to for consolation . The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny . Were it a decided thing , an actual refusal , I hope I should know how to bear it , and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart , and in the course of a few years \u2014 but I am writing nonsense . Were I refused , I must bear it ; and till I am , I can never cease to try for her . This is the truth . The only question is _ how _ ? What may be the likeliest means ? I have sometimes thought of going to London again after Easter , and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield . Even now , she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June ; but June is at a great distance , and I believe I shall write to her . I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter . To be at an early certainty is a material object . My present state is miserably irksome . Considering everything , I think a letter will be decidedly the best method of explanation . I shall be able to write much that I could not say , and shall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer , and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse ; I think I am . My greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser , and I at a distance unable to help my own cause . A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation , and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision , an adviser may , in an unlucky moment , lead it to do what it may afterwards regret . I must think this matter over a little . This long letter , full of my own concerns alone , will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny . The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser \u2019s party . I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him . There is not a shadow of wavering . He thoroughly knows his own mind , and acts up to his resolutions : an inestimable quality . I could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me , and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends . There was marked coolness on her side . They scarcely spoke . I saw him draw back surprised , and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram . You will wish to hear my opinion of Maria \u2019s degree of comfort as a wife . There is no appearance of unhappiness . I hope they get on pretty well together . I dined twice in Wimpole Street , and might have been there oftener , but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother . Julia seems to enjoy London exceedingly . I had little enjoyment there , but have less here . We are not a lively party . You are very much wanted . I miss you more than I can express . My mother desires her best love , and hopes to hear from you soon . She talks of you almost every hour , and I am sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you . My father means to fetch you himself , but it will not be till after Easter , when he has business in town . You are happy at Portsmouth , I hope , but this must not be a yearly visit . I want you at home , that I may have your opinion about Thornton Lacey . I have little heart for extensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress . I think I shall certainly write . It is quite settled that the Grants go to Bath ; they leave Mansfield on Monday . I am glad of it . I am not comfortable enough to be fit for anybody ; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.\u2014Yours ever , my dearest Fanny . \u201d"}, {"position": [1778, 1795], "text": "I never will , no , I certainly never will wish for a letter again , \u201d"}, {"position": [1806, 1837], "text": "What do they bring but disappointment and sorrow ?

This is my modest request and expectation , for you are so good , that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve , and I write now to beg an immediate answer . I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park , and you , no doubt , are perfectly able to give it . One should be a brute not to feel for the distress they are in ; and from what I hear , poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery . I thought little of his illness at first . I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with , and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder , and was chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him ; but now it is confidently asserted that he is really in a decline , that the symptoms are most alarming , and that part of the family , at least , are aware of it . If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed . I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake , but the report is so prevalent that I confess I can not help trembling . To have such a fine young man cut off in the flower of his days is most melancholy . Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully . I really am quite agitated on the subject . Fanny , Fanny , I see you smile and look cunning , but , upon my honour , I never bribed a physician in my life . Poor young man ! If he is to die , there will be _ two _ poor young men less in the world ; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one , that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of them . It was a foolish precipitation last Christmas , but the evil of a few days may be blotted out in part . Varnish and gilding hide many stains . It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name . With real affection , Fanny , like mine , more might be overlooked . Write to me by return of post , judge of my anxiety , and do not trifle with it . Tell me the real truth , as you have it from the fountainhead . And now , do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own . Believe me , they are not only natural , they are philanthropic and virtuous . I put it to your conscience , whether \u2018 Sir Edmund \u2019 would not do more good with all the Bertram property than any other possible \u2018 Sir . \u2019 Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you , but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth , his sisters not being within my reach . Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham ( as to be sure you know ) , and is not yet returned ; and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square , but I forget their name and street . Could I immediately apply to either , however , I should still prefer you , because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up , as to shut their eyes to the truth . I suppose Mrs. R. \u2019s Easter holidays will not last much longer ; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her . The Aylmers are pleasant people ; and her husband away , she can have nothing but enjoyment . I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to Bath , to fetch his mother ; but how will she and the dowager agree in one house ? Henry is not at hand , so I have nothing to say from him . Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago , but for this illness?\u2014Yours ever , Mary . \u201d \u201c"}], "Her uncle": [{"position": [6938, 6989], "text": "uncle , she understood , meant to fetch her ; and as her cousin \u2019s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary , she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present , and that she should be felt an encumbrance . \u201d Her"}]}
