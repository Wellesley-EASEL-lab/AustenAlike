{"document": "8 From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle . They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove 's , for the little boy 's state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings . Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof ; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each ; they could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth . His profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and \" That was in the year six ; \" \" That happened before I went to sea in the year six , \" occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke , Anne felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself . There must be the same immediate association of thought , though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain . They had no conversation together , no intercourse but what the commonest civility required . Once so much to each other ! Now nothing ! There had been a time , when of all the large party now filling the drawing - room at Uppercross , they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another . With the exception , perhaps , of Admiral and Mrs Croft , who seemed particularly attached and happy , ( Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ) , there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison , no countenances so beloved . Now they were as strangers ; nay , worse than strangers , for they could never become acquainted . It was a perpetual estrangement . When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind . There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c. , and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use . From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove 's who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying-- \" Ah ! Miss Anne , if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son , I dare say he would have been just such another by this time . \" Anne suppressed a smile , and listened kindly , while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more ; and for a few minutes , therefore , could not keep pace with the conversation of the others . When she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at Uppercross ) , and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded . \" Your first was the Asp , I remember ; we will look for the Asp . \" \" You will not find her there . Quite worn out and broken up . I was the last man who commanded her . Hardly fit for service then . Reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so I was sent off to the West Indies . \" The girls looked all amazement . \" The Admiralty , \" he continued , \" entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed . But they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed . \" \" Phoo ! phoo ! \" cried the Admiral , \" what stuff these young fellows talk ! Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day . For an old built sloop , you would not see her equal . Lucky fellow to get her ! He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time . Lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his . \" \" I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ; \" replied Captain Wentworth , seriously . \" I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire . It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , I wanted to be doing something . \" \" To be sure you did . What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ? If a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again . \" \" But , Captain Wentworth , \" cried Louisa , \" how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you . \" \" I knew pretty well what she was before that day ; \" said he , smiling . \" I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself . Ah ! she was a dear old Asp to me . She did all that I wanted . I knew she would . I knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted . I brought her into Plymouth ; and here another instance of luck . We had not been six hours in the Sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time ; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition . Four - and - twenty hours later , and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth , in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me . \" Anne 's shudderings were to herself alone ; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere , in their exclamations of pity and horror . \" And so then , I suppose , \" said Mrs Musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , \" so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy . Charles , my dear , \" ( beckoning him to her ) , \" do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother . I always forgot . \" \" It was at Gibraltar , mother , I know . Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth . \" \" Oh ! but , Charles , tell Captain Wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . \" Charles , being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case , only nodded in reply , and walked away . The girls were now hunting for the Laconia ; and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble , and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate , and present non - commissioned class , observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had . \" Ah ! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia ! How fast I made money in her . A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands . Poor Harville , sister ! You know how much he wanted money : worse than myself . He had a wife . Excellent fellow . I shall never forget his happiness . He felt it all , so much for her sake . I wished for him again the next summer , when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean . \" \" And I am sure , Sir . \" said Mrs Musgrove , \" it was a lucky day for us , when you were put captain into that ship . We shall never forget what you did . \" Her feelings made her speak low ; and Captain Wentworth , hearing only in part , and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more . \" My brother , \" whispered one of the girls ; \" mamma is thinking of poor Richard . \" \" Poor dear fellow ! \" continued Mrs Musgrove ; \" he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care ! Ah ! it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you . I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . \" There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth 's face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove 's kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent 's feelings . They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove . It was no insignificant barrier , indeed . Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of Anne 's slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for . Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions . A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction , as the most graceful set of limbs in the world . But , fair or not fair , there are unbecoming conjunctions , which reason will patronize in vain-- which taste can not tolerate -- which ridicule will seize . The Admiral , after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him , being called to order by his wife , now came up to Captain Wentworth , and without any observation of what he might be interrupting , thinking only of his own thoughts , began with-- \" If you had been a week later at Lisbon , last spring , Frederick , you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters . \" \" Should I ? I am glad I was not a week later then . \" The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry . He defended himself ; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his , excepting for a ball , or a visit , which a few hours might comprehend . \" But , if I know myself , \" said he , \" this is from no want of gallantry towards them . It is rather from feeling how impossible it is , with all one 's efforts , and all one 's sacrifices , to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have . There can be no want of gallantry , Admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do . I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it . \" This brought his sister upon him . \" Oh ! Frederick ! But I can not believe it of you . --All idle refinement ! --Women may be as comfortable on board , as in the best house in England . I believe I have lived as much on board as most women , and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man - of - war . I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at Kellynch Hall , \" ( with a kind bow to Anne ) , \" beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether . \" \" Nothing to the purpose , \" replied her brother . \" You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board . \" \" But you , yourself , brought Mrs Harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from Portsmouth to Plymouth . Where was this superfine , extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ? \" \" All merged in my friendship , Sophia . I would assist any brother officer 's wife that I could , and I would bring anything of Harville 's from the world 's end , if he wanted it . But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself . \" \" Depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable . \" \" I might not like them the better for that perhaps . Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board . \" \" My dear Frederick , you are talking quite idly . Pray , what would become of us poor sailors ' wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ? \" \" My feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth . \" \" But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures . We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days . \" \" Ah ! my dear , \" said the Admiral , \" when he had got a wife , he will sing a different tune . When he is married , if we have the good luck to live to another war , we shall see him do as you and I , and a great many others , have done . We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife . \" \" Ay , that we shall . \" \" Now I have done , \" cried Captain Wentworth . \" When once married people begin to attack me with,--`Oh ! you will think very differently , when you are married . ' I can only say , ` No , I shall not ; ' and then they say again , ` Yes , you will , ' and there is an end of it . \" He got up and moved away . \" What a great traveller you must have been , ma'am ! \" said Mrs Musgrove to Mrs Croft . \" Pretty well , ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more . I have crossed the Atlantic four times , and have been once to the East Indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : Cork , and Lisbon , and Gibraltar . But I never went beyond the Streights , and never was in the West Indies . We do not call Bermuda or Bahama , you know , the West Indies . \" Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent ; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life . \" And I do assure you , ma'am , \" pursued Mrs Croft , \" that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man - of - war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates . When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared . Thank God ! I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me . A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards . The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when the Admiral ( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas . I lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when I should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and I never met with the smallest inconvenience . \" \" Aye , to be sure . Yes , indeed , oh yes ! I am quite of your opinion , Mrs Croft , \" was Mrs Musgrove 's hearty answer . \" There is nothing so bad as a separation . I am quite of your opinion . I know what it is , for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes , and I am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again . \" The evening ended with dancing . On its being proposed , Anne offered her services , as usual ; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument , she was extremely glad to be employed , and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved . It was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth . She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do . The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . Once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced ? The answer was , \" Oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing . She had rather play . She is never tired of playing . \" Once , too , he spoke to her . She had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of . Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness-- \" I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; \" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again . Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches . His cold politeness , his ceremonious grace , were worse than anything .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [29, 32], "text": "the little boy"}, {"position": [38, 39], "text": "his"},
