{"document": "21 Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object . She felt a great deal of good - will towards him . In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion . She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession . It was altogether very extraordinary ; flattering , but painful . There was much to regret . How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case , was not worth enquiry ; for there was a Captain Wentworth ; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad , her affection would be his for ever . Their union , she believed , could not divide her more from other men , than their final separation . Prettier musings of high - wrought love and eternal constancy , could never have passed along the streets of Bath , than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings . It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way . She was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment . An account of the concert was immediately claimed ; and Anne 's recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it . All that she could tell she told most gladly , but the all was little for one who had been there , and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith , who had already heard , through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter , rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate , and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company . Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs Smith . \" The little Durands were there , I conclude , \" said she , \" with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed . They never miss a concert . \" \" Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room . \" \" The Ibbotsons , were they there ? and the two new beauties , with the tall Irish officer , who is talked of for one of them . \" \" I do not know . I do not think they were . \" \" Old Lady Mary Maclean ? I need not ask after her . She never misses , I know ; and you must have seen her . She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course . \" \" No , that was what I dreaded . It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect . But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off ; and we were exceedingly well placed , that is , for hearing ; I must not say for seeing , because I appear to have seen very little . \" \" Oh ! you saw enough for your own amusement . I can understand . There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd , and this you had . You were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond . \" \" But I ought to have looked about me more , \" said Anne , conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about , that the object only had been deficient . \" No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . I see it in your eye . I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to . In the intervals of the concert it was conversation . \" Anne half smiled and said , \" Do you see that in my eye ? \" \" Yes , I do . Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together . \" A blush overspread Anne 's cheeks . She could say nothing . \" And such being the case , \" continued Mrs Smith , after a short pause , \" I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning . It is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time . \" Anne heard nothing of this . She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend 's penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence-- \" Pray , \" said Mrs Smith , \" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ? \" \" Mr Elliot ! \" repeated Anne , looking up surprised . A moment 's reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under . She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , \" Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ? \" \" I have been a good deal acquainted with him , \" replied Mrs Smith , gravely , \" but it seems worn out now . It is a great while since we met . \" \" I was not at all aware of this . You never mentioned it before . Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . \" \" To confess the truth , \" said Mrs Smith , assuming her usual air of cheerfulness , \" that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have . I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot . I want your interest with him . He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done . \" \" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , \" replied Anne ; \" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation . If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . \" Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said-- \" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon . I ought to have waited for official information , But now , my dear Miss Elliot , as an old friend , do give me a hint as to when I may speak . Next week ? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot 's good fortune . \" \" No , \" replied Anne , \" nor next week , nor next , nor next . I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . I am not going to marry Mr Elliot . I should like to know why you imagine I am ? \" Mrs Smith looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed-- \" Now , how I do wish I understood you ! How I do wish I knew what you were at ! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs . Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? Let me plead for my -- present friend I can not call him , but for my former friend . Where can you look for a more suitable match ? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot . I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ? \" \" My dear Mrs Smith , Mr Elliot 's wife has not been dead much above half a year . He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . \" \" Oh ! if these are your only objections , \" cried Mrs Smith , archly , \" Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him . Do not forget me when you are married , that 's all . Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps . Ninety - nine out of a hundred would do the same . Of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me . Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy . Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman . Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin . \" \" No , \" said Anne , \" I can readily believe all that of my cousin . He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions . I consider him with great respect . I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise . But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ? Surely this must be calm enough . And , upon my word , he is nothing to me . Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ) , I shall not accept him . I assure you I shall not . I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that-- \" She stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much ; but less would hardly have been sufficient . Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot 's failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else . As it was , she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond ; and Anne , eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot ; where she could have received the idea , or from whom she could have heard it . \" Do tell me how it first came into your head . \" \" It first came into my head , \" replied Mrs Smith , \" upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way . But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago . \" \" And has it indeed been spoken of ? \" \" Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ? \" \" No . Was not it Mrs Speed , as usual , or the maid ? I observed no one in particular . \" \" It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by - the - bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot . She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority . She sat an hour with me on Monday evening , and gave me the whole history . \" \" The whole history , \" repeated Anne , laughing . \" She could not make a very long history , I think , of one such little article of unfounded news . \" Mrs Smith said nothing . \" But , \" continued Anne , presently , \" though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could . Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ? Shall I take any message ? \" \" No , I thank you : no , certainly not . In the warmth of the moment , and under a mistaken impression , I might , perhaps , have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances ; but not now . No , I thank you , I have nothing to trouble you with . \" \" I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ? \" \" I did . \" \" Not before he was married , I suppose ? \" \" Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first . \" \" And -- were you much acquainted ? \" \" Intimately . \" \" Indeed ! Then do tell me what he was at that time of life . I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man . Was he at all such as he appears now ? \" \" I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years , \" was Mrs Smith 's answer , given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther ; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity . They were both silent : Mrs Smith very thoughtful . At last-- \" I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot , \" she cried , in her natural tone of cordiality , \" I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do . I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you . There were many things to be taken into the account . One hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief . Even the smooth surface of family - union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath . However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot 's real character . Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him . Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold - blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others . Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . Oh ! he is black at heart , hollow and black ! \" Anne 's astonished air , and exclamation of wonder , made her pause , and in a calmer manner , she added , \" My expressions startle you . You must allow for an injured , angry woman . But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him . I will only tell you what I have found him . Facts shall speak . He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . The intimacy had been formed before our marriage . I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him . At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together . We were principally in town , living in very good style . He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother . My poor Charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him . \" \" This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot 's life , \" said Anne , \" which has always excited my particular curiosity . It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times . It seemed to announce a different sort of man . \" \" I know it all , I know it all , \" cried Mrs Smith . \" He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever . I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go . I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time . I was privy to all the fors and againsts ; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put . \" \" Nay , \" said Anne , \" I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ? \" \" Mr Elliot , \" replied Mrs Smith , \" at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage . He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I can not decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you . He told me the whole story . He had no concealments with me . It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other . \" \" Perhaps , \" cried Anne , struck by a sudden idea , \" you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ? \" \" To be sure I did ; very often . I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from-- \" She checked herself just in time . \" This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night , \" cried Anne . \" This explains it . I found he had been used to hear of me . I could not comprehend how . What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned ! How sure to be mistaken ! But I beg your pardon ; I have interrupted you . Mr Elliot married then completely for money ? The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . \" Mrs Smith hesitated a little here . \" Oh ! those things are too common . When one lives in the world , a man or woman 's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . I was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct . We lived for enjoyment . I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing . ` To do the best for himself , ' passed as a duty . \" \" But was not she a very low woman ? \" \" Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard . Money , money , was all that he wanted . Her father was a grazier , her grandfather had been a butcher , but that was all nothing . She was a fine woman , had had a decent education , was brought forward by some cousins , thrown by chance into Mr Elliot 's company , and fell in love with him ; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side , with respect to her birth . All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune , before he committed himself . Depend upon it , whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it . His chance for the Kellynch estate was something , but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt . I have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject . It would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof . \" \" Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none , \" cried Anne . \" You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago . This is all in confirmation , rather , of what we used to hear and believe . I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . \" \" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . \" Anne , seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it , did as she was desired . The box was brought and placed before her , and Mrs Smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said-- \" This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him . The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine . But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it . \" This was the letter , directed to \" Charles Smith , Esq . Tunbridge Wells , \" and dated from London , as far back as July , 1803 : -- \" Dear Smith,--I have received yours . Your kindness almost overpowers me . I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three - and - twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it . At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again . Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss. They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer . The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough . If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . He is worse than last year . \" I wish I had any name but Elliot . I am sick of it . The name of Walter I can drop , thank God ! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly,--Wm . Elliot . \" Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said-- \" The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . But it shows you the man . Mark his professions to my poor husband . Can any thing be stronger ? \" Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father . She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say-- \" Thank you . This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ? \" \" I can explain this too , \" cried Mrs Smith , smiling . \" Can you really ? \" \" Yes . I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now . I can not produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing . He is no hypocrite now . He truly wants to marry you . His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart . I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis . \" \" Colonel Wallis ! you are acquainted with him ? \" \" No . It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that ; it takes a bend or two , but nothing of consequence . The stream is as good as at first ; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away . Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you , which said Colonel Wallis , I imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her . She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me . On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings . When I talked of a whole history , therefore , you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed . \" \" My dear Mrs Smith , your authority is deficient . This will not do . Mr Elliot 's having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father . That was all prior to my coming to Bath . I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived . \" \" I know you did ; I know it all perfectly , but-- \" \" Indeed , Mrs Smith , we must not expect to get real information in such a line . Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left . \" \" Only give me a hearing . You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm . Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement . He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you . So says my historian , at least . Is this true ? Did he see you last summer or autumn , ` somewhere down in the west , ' to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? \" \" He certainly did . So far it is very true . At Lyme . I happened to be at Lyme . \" \" Well , \" continued Mrs Smith , triumphantly , \" grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted . He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me . My account states , that your sister 's friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September ( in short when they first came themselves ) , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter 's acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger . \" Here Mrs Smith paused a moment ; but Anne had not a word to say , and she continued-- \" This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail . Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot 's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling . He can not bear the idea of not being Sir William . You may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could . He was to be introduced , and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced . Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do . \" \" Yes , \" said Anne , \" you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known , or could imagine . There is always something offensive in the details of cunning . The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me . I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied . I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . \" \" Lessening , I understand , \" replied Mrs Smith . \" He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence . Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry , that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay . A scheme , worthy of Mrs Wallis 's understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it . ` Why , to be sure , ma'am , ' said she , ` it would not prevent his marrying anybody else . ' And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter 's making a second match . She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot , through Mrs Wallis 's recommendation ? \" \" I am very glad to know all this , \" said Anne , after a little thoughtfulness . \" It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him , but I shall know better what to do . My line of conduct will be more direct . Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness . \" But Mr Elliot was not done with . Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife 's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him . Mr Elliot , raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self - indulgence he had become a prudent man ) , and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend 's probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined . The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it . They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that Mr Elliot 's had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known . With a confidence in Mr Elliot 's regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but Mr Elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation . Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her . It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity ; and Anne felt , at some moments , that no flagrant open crime could have been worse . She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence . Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend 's usual state of mind . There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation . She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich . But there was nobody to stir in it . Mr Elliot would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money . She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel , and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law . This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means . To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear . It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne 's good offices with Mr Elliot . She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne 's feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot 's character would allow , when Anne 's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith 's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation . \" She had seemed to recommend and praise him ! \" \" My dear , \" was Mrs Smith 's reply , \" there was nothing else to be done . I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless . He was very unkind to his first wife . They were wretched together . But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her . I was willing to hope that you must fare better . \" Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell ! And under such a supposition , which would have been most miserable , when time had disclosed all , too late ? It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text":
