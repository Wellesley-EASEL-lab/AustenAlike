{"document": "17 While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in Laura Place , Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description . She had called on her former governess , and had heard from her of there being an old school - fellow in Bath , who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering . Miss Hamilton , now Mrs Smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable . Anne had gone unhappy to school , grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved , feeling her separation from home , and suffering as a girl of fourteen , of strong sensibility and not high spirits , must suffer at such a time ; and Miss Hamilton , three years older than herself , but still from the want of near relations and a settled home , remaining another year at school , had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery , and could never be remembered with indifference . Miss Hamilton had left school , had married not long afterwards , was said to have married a man of fortune , and this was all that Anne had known of her , till now that their governess 's account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form . She was a widow and poor . Her husband had been extravagant ; and at his death , about two years before , had left his affairs dreadfully involved . She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with , and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever , which , finally settling in her legs , had made her for the present a cripple . She had come to Bath on that account , and was now in lodgings near the hot baths , living in a very humble way , unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant , and of course almost excluded from society . Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith , and Anne therefore lost no time in going . She mentioned nothing of what she had heard , or what she intended , at home . It would excite no proper interest there . She only consulted Lady Russell , who entered thoroughly into her sentiments , and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith 's lodgings in Westgate Buildings , as Anne chose to be taken . The visit was paid , their acquaintance re - established , their interest in each other more than re - kindled . The first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion . Twelve years were gone since they had parted , and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined . Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming , silent , unformed girl of fifteen , to the elegant little woman of seven - and - twenty , with every beauty except bloom , and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle ; and twelve years had transformed the fine - looking , well - grown Miss Hamilton , in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority , into a poor , infirm , helpless widow , receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour ; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away , and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times . Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on , and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation . Neither the dissipations of the past -- and she had lived very much in the world -- nor the restrictions of the present , neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits . In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness , and Anne 's astonishment increased . She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith 's . She had been very fond of her husband : she had buried him . She had been used to affluence : it was gone . She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again , no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs , no health to make all the rest supportable . Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath . Yet , in spite of all this , Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression , to hours of occupation and enjoyment . How could it be ? She watched , observed , reflected , and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only . A submissive spirit might be patient , a strong understanding would supply resolution , but here was something more ; here was that elasticity of mind , that disposition to be comforted , that power of turning readily from evil to good , and of finding employment which carried her out of herself , which was from nature alone . It was the choicest gift of Heaven ; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which , by a merciful appointment , it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want . There had been a time , Mrs Smith told her , when her spirits had nearly failed . She could not call herself an invalid now , compared with her state on first reaching Bath . Then she had , indeed , been a pitiable object ; for she had caught cold on the journey , and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain ; and all this among strangers , with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse , and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense . She had weathered it , however , and could truly say that it had done her good . It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands . She had seen too much of the world , to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere , but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve , and would not use her ill ; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse , as a sister of her landlady , a nurse by profession , and who had always a home in that house when unemployed , chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her . \" And she , \" said Mrs Smith , \" besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance . As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread - cases , pin - cushions and card - racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood . She had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise . She always takes the right time for applying . Everybody 's heart is open , you know , when they have recently escaped from severe pain , or are recovering the blessing of health , and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak . She is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman . Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ` the best education in the world , ' know nothing worth attending to . Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour 's leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one 's species better . One likes to hear what is going on , to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . To me , who live so much alone , her conversation , I assure you , is a treat . \" Anne , far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure , replied , \" I can easily believe it . Women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ! And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self - denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes . \" \" Yes , \" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly , \" sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe . Here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber : it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude , that one hears of . There is so little real friendship in the world ! and unfortunately \" ( speaking low and tremulously ) \" there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late . \" Anne saw the misery of such feelings . The husband had not been what he ought , and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved . It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith ; she shook it off , and soon added in a different tone-- \" I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis , however . She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high - priced things I have in hand now . \" Anne had called several times on her friend , before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place . At last , it became necessary to speak of her . Sir Walter , Elizabeth and Mrs Clay , returned one morning from Laura Place , with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening , and Anne was already engaged , to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings . She was not sorry for the excuse . They were only asked , she was sure , because Lady Dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold , was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her ; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow . \" They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne ; but still there were questions enough asked , to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was ; and Elizabeth was disdainful , and Sir Walter severe . \" Westgate Buildings ! \" said he , \" and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings ? A Mrs Smith . A widow Mrs Smith ; and who was her husband ? One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere . And what is her attraction ? That she is old and sickly . Upon my word , Miss Anne Elliot , you have the most extraordinary taste ! Everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you . But surely you may put off this old lady till to - morrow : she is not so near her end , I presume , but that she may hope to see another day . What is her age ? Forty ? \" \" No , sir , she is not one - and - thirty ; but I do not think I can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself . She goes into the warm bath to - morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged . \" \" But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance ? \" asked Elizabeth . \" She sees nothing to blame in it , \" replied Anne ; \" on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith . \" Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement , \" observed Sir Walter . \" Sir Henry Russell 's widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot . A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith ! Such a name ! \" Mrs Clay , who had been present while all this passed , now thought it advisable to leave the room , and Anne could have said much , and did long to say a little in defence of her friend 's not very dissimilar claims to theirs , but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her . She made no reply . She left it to himself to recollect , that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity . Anne kept her appointment ; the others kept theirs , and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening . She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell . To her , its greatest interest must be , in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot ; in having been wished for , regretted , and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause . Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot . She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing . She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject , she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter , of a possible attachment on his side , of the desirableness of the alliance , supposing such attachment to be real and returned . Anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head . \" I am no match - maker , as you well know , \" said Lady Russell , \" being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . A most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but I think it might be a very happy one . \" \" Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him , \" said Anne ; \" but we should not suit . \" Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , \" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! \" Anne was obliged to turn away , to rise , to walk to a distant table , and , leaning there in pretended employment , try to subdue the feelings this picture excited . For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched . The idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of \" Lady Elliot \" first revived in herself ; of being restored to Kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist . Lady Russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed , in short , what Anne did not believe . The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again . The charm of Kellynch and of \" Lady Elliot \" all faded away . She never could accept him . And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one ; her judgement , on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against Mr Elliot . Though they had now been acquainted a month , she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character . That he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough . He certainly knew what was right , nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed ; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct . She distrusted the past , if not the present . The names which occasionally dropt of former associates , the allusions to former practices and pursuits , suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been . She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ? Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . There was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others . This , to Anne , was a decided imperfection . Her early impressions were incurable . She prized the frank , the open - hearted , the eager character beyond all others . Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still . She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing , than of those whose presence of mind never varied , whose tongue never slipped . Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable . Various as were the tempers in her father 's house , he pleased them all . He endured too well , stood too well with every body . He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay ; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about , and to hold her in contempt ; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body . Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust . She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [16, 17], "text": "Anne"}, {"position": [27, 28], "text": "She"}, {"position": [31, 32], "text": "her"},
