{"document": "9 Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home , to stay as long as he liked , being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral 's fraternal kindness as of his wife 's . He had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into Shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off . There was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of Edward 's wife upon credit a little longer . It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day . The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment . Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth 's introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father 's house , only two miles from Uppercross . A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing Captain Wentworth . Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters . They had each had money , but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence . Mr Hayter had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove 's ; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young Hayters would , from their parents ' inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with Uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest . The two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins . Charles 's attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation . \" It would not be a great match for her ; but if Henrietta liked him,\"-- and Henrietta did seem to like him . Henrietta fully thought so herself , before Captain Wentworth came ; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten . Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful , as far as Anne 's observation reached . Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , Louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him . Mr and Mrs Musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion - house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves ' company , and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared , when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to which was the one liked best . Charles gave it for Louisa , Mary for Henrietta , but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful . Charles \" had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war . Here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy . Oh ! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters . \" \" Upon my word it would , \" replied Mary . \" Dear me ! If he should rise to any very great honours ! If he should ever be made a baronet ! ` Lady Wentworth ' sounds very well . That would be a noble thing , indeed , for Henrietta ! She would take place of me then , and Henrietta would not dislike that . Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth ! It would be but a new creation , however , and I never think much of your new creations . \" It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed -- very sad for herself and her children . \" You know , \" said she , \" I can not think him at all a fit match for Henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away . I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them . And , pray , who is Charles Hayter ? Nothing but a country curate . A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross . \" Her husband , however , would not agree with her here ; for besides having a regard for his cousin , Charles Hayter was an eldest son , and he saw things as an eldest son himself . \" Now you are taking nonsense , Mary , \" was therefore his answer . \" It would not be a great match for Henrietta , but Charles has a very fair chance , through the Spicers , of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two ; and you will please to remember , that he is the eldest son ; whenever my uncle dies , he steps into very pretty property . The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres , besides the farm near Taunton , which is some of the best land in the country . I grant you , that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property . No , no ; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter ; and if she has him , and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth , I shall be very well satisfied . \" \" Charles may say what he pleases , \" cried Mary to Anne , as soon as he was out of the room , \" but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and I have very little doubt that he has . She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday . I wish you had been there to see her behaviour . And as to Captain Wentworth 's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best . But Charles is so positive ! I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me . \" A dinner at Mr Musgrove 's had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little Charles . She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening . As to Captain Wentworth 's views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta . Either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good - humoured wife . With regard to Charles Hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well - meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alternation could not be understood too soon . Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin 's behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause . He had been absent only two Sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of Uppercross instead . It had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that Dr Shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it . The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley 's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta . When he came back , alas ! the zeal of the business was gone by . Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley : she was at a window , looking out for Captain Wentworth ; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give , and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation . \" Well , I am very glad indeed : but I always thought you would have it ; I always thought you sure . It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise . Is he coming , Louisa ? \" One morning , very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves , at which Anne had not been present , Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing - room at the Cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid Charles , who was lying on the sofa . The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot , deprived his manners of their usual composure : he started , and could only say , \" I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here : Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here , \" before he walked to the window to recollect himself , and feel how he ought to behave . \" They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say , \" had been Anne 's reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself . He continued at the window ; and after calmly and politely saying , \" I hope the little boy is better , \" was silent . She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa , and remain there to satisfy her patient ; and thus they continued a few minutes , when , to her very great satisfaction , she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule . She hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy -- Charles Hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne . She only attempted to say , \" How do you do ? Will you not sit down ? The others will be here presently . \" Captain Wentworth , however , came from his window , apparently not ill - disposed for conversation ; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window . Another minute brought another addition . The younger boy , a remarkable stout , forward child , of two years old , having got the door opened for him by some one without , made his determined appearance among them , and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on , and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away . There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about Charles , she could not shake him off . She spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain . Once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly . \" Walter , \" said she , \" get down this moment . You are extremely troublesome . I am very angry with you . \" \" Walter , \" cried Charles Hayter , \" why do you not do as you are bid ? Do not you hear your aunt speak ? Come to me , Walter , come to cousin Charles . \" But not a bit did Walter stir . In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it . Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . She could not even thank him . She could only hang over little Charles , with most disordered feelings . His kindness in stepping forward to her relief , the manner , the silence in which it had passed , the little particulars of the circumstance , with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child , that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks , and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants , produced such a confusion of varying , but very painful agitation , as she could not recover from , till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares , and leave the room . She could not stay . It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four-- they were now altogether ; but she could stay for none of it . It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth . She had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after Captain Wentworth 's interference , \" You ought to have minded me , Walter ; I told you not to teaze your aunt ; \" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself . But neither Charles Hayter 's feelings , nor anybody 's feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own . She was ashamed of herself , quite ashamed of being so nervous , so overcome by such a trifle ; but so it was , and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her .",
