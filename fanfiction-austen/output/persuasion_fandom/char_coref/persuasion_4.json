{"document": "4 He was not Mr Wentworth , the former curate of Monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a Captain Frederick Wentworth , his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into Somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at Monkford . He was , at that time , a remarkably fine young man , with a great deal of intelligence , spirit , and brilliancy ; and Anne an extremely pretty girl , with gentleness , modesty , taste , and feeling . Half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail . They were gradually acquainted , and when acquainted , rapidly and deeply in love . It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other , or which had been the happiest : she , in receiving his declarations and proposals , or he in having them accepted . A short period of exquisite felicity followed , and but a short one . Troubles soon arose . Sir Walter , on being applied to , without actually withholding his consent , or saying it should never be , gave it all the negative of great astonishment , great coldness , great silence , and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter . He thought it a very degrading alliance ; and Lady Russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one . Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of ! Anne Elliot , so young ; known to so few , to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune ; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing , anxious , youth - killing dependence ! It must not be , if by any fair interference of friendship , any representations from one who had almost a mother 's love , and mother 's rights , it would be prevented . Captain Wentworth had no fortune . He had been lucky in his profession ; but spending freely , what had come freely , had realized nothing . But he was confident that he should soon be rich : full of life and ardour , he knew that he should soon have a ship , and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted . He had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still . Such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for Anne ; but Lady Russell saw it very differently . His sanguine temper , and fearlessness of mind , operated very differently on her . She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil . It only added a dangerous character to himself . He was brilliant , he was headstrong . Lady Russell had little taste for wit , and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror . She deprecated the connexion in every light . Such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than Anne could combat . Young and gentle as she was , it might yet have been possible to withstand her father 's ill - will , though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister ; but Lady Russell , whom she had always loved and relied on , could not , with such steadiness of opinion , and such tenderness of manner , be continually advising her in vain . She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing : indiscreet , improper , hardly capable of success , and not deserving it . But it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it . Had she not imagined herself consulting his good , even more than her own , she could hardly have given him up . The belief of being prudent , and self - denying , principally for his advantage , was her chief consolation , under the misery of a parting , a final parting ; and every consolation was required , for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions , on his side , totally unconvinced and unbending , and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment . He had left the country in consequence . A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended Anne 's share of suffering from it . Her attachment and regrets had , for a long time , clouded every enjoyment of youth , and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect . More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture ) , or in any novelty or enlargement of society . No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle , who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth , as he stood in her memory . No second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . She had been solicited , when about two - and - twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal ; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to Sir Walter 's , and of good character and appearance ; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more , while Anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty - two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father 's house , and settled so permanently near herself . But in this case , Anne had left nothing for advice to do ; and though Lady Russell , as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne 's being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits . They knew not each other 's opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of Anne 's conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but Anne , at seven - and - twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen . She did not blame Lady Russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good . She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home , and every anxiety attending his profession , all their probable fears , delays , and disappointments , she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement , than she had been in the sacrifice of it ; and this , she fully believed , had the usual share , had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs , without reference to the actual results of their case , which , as it happened , would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on . All his sanguine expectations , all his confidence had been justified . His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path . He had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place . He had distinguished himself , and early gained the other step in rank , and must now , by successive captures , have made a handsome fortune . She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority , but she could not doubt his being rich ; and , in favour of his constancy , she had no reason to believe him married . How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been ! how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in futurity , against that over - anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence ! She had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning . With all these circumstances , recollections and feelings , she could not hear that Captain Wentworth 's sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain ; and many a stroll , and many a sigh , were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea . She often told herself it was folly , before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil . She was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it . She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell 's motives in this , over those of her father and Elizabeth ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of Admiral Croft 's really taking Kellynch Hall , she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to those three only among her connexions , by whom no syllable , she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received any information of their short - lived engagement . That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature 's having heard of it from him . The sister , Mrs Croft , had then been out of England , accompanying her husband on a foreign station , and her own sister , Mary , had been at school while it all occurred ; and never admitted by the pride of some , and the delicacy of others , to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards . With these supports , she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts , which , with Lady Russell , still resident in Kellynch , and Mary fixed only three miles off , must be anticipated , need not involve any particular awkwardness .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "He"}, {"position": [25, 26], "text": "his"}, {"position": [73, 74], "text":
