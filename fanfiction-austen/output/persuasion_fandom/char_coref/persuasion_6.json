{"document": "6 Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross , to learn that a removal from one set of people to another , though at a distance of only three miles , will often include a total change of conversation , opinion , and idea . She had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove : \" So , Miss Anne , Sir Walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ? \" and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ' addition of , \" I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your Queen Squares for us ! \" or in the anxious supplement from Mary , of-- \" Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath ! \" She could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell . The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard , and to destroy , their own horses , dogs , and newspapers to engage them , and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping , neighbours , dress , dancing , and music . She acknowledged it to be very fitting , that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse ; and hoped , ere long , to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into . With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible . She had no dread of these two months . Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion . Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else . He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife 's occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne 's admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ) , they might pass for a happy couple . They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ; but here , as on most topics , he had the superiority , for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father 's having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked . As to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife 's , and his practice not so bad . \" I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary 's interference , \" was what Anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to Mary 's reproach of \" Charles spoils the children so that I can not get them into any order , \" she never had the smallest temptation to say , \" Very true . \" One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house . Known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable . \" I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill , \" was Charles 's language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke Mary : \" I do believe if Charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me . I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse than I ever own . \" Mary 's declaration was , \" I hate sending the children to the Great House , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day . \" And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne , to say , \" Oh ! Miss Anne , I can not help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children . They are quite different creatures with you ! But to be sure , in general they are so spoilt ! It is a pity you can not put your sister in the way of managing them . They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen , poor little dears ! without partiality ; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated-- ! Bless me ! how troublesome they are sometimes . I assure you , Miss Anne , it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should . I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; \" do n't do this , \" and \" do n't do that ; \" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them . \" She had this communication , moreover , from Mary . \" Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but I am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house - maid and laundry - maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long . I meet them wherever I go ; and I declare , I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them . If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them . \" And on Mrs Musgrove 's side , it was , \" I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter - in - law 's concerns , for I know it would not do ; but I shall tell you , Miss Anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles 's nursery - maid : I hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , I can declare , she is such a fine - dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near . Mrs Charles quite swears by her , I know ; but I just give you this hint , that you may be upon the watch ; because , if you see anything amiss , you need not be afraid of mentioning it . \" Again , it was Mary 's complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , \" I have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it . It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world , but I know it is taken notice of by many persons . \" How was Anne to set all these matters to rights ? She could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister 's benefit . In all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well . Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from Kellynch ; Mary 's ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage . It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters . She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware . She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation . Excepting one short period of her life , she had never , since the age of fourteen , never since the loss of her dear mother , known the happiness of being listened to , or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste . In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world ; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's fond partiality for their own daughters ' performance , and total indifference to any other person 's , gave her much more pleasure for their sakes , than mortification for her own . The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company . The neighbourhood was not large , but the Musgroves were visited by everybody , and had more dinner - parties , and more callers , more visitors by invitation and by chance , than any other family . There were more completely popular . The girls were wild for dancing ; and the evenings ended , occasionally , in an unpremeditated little ball . There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross , in less affluent circumstances , who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures : they would come at any time , and help play at anything , or dance anywhere ; and Anne , very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post , played country dances to them by the hour together ; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else , and often drew this compliment;-- \" Well done , Miss Anne ! very well done indeed ! Lord bless me ! how those little fingers of yours fly about ! \" So passed the first three weeks . Michaelmas came ; and now Anne 's heart must be in Kellynch again . A beloved home made over to others ; all the precious rooms and furniture , groves , and prospects , beginning to own other eyes and other limbs ! She could not think of much else on the 29th of September ; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary , who , on having occasion to note down the day of the month , exclaimed , \" Dear me , is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch ? I am glad I did not think of it before . How low it makes me ! \" The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness , and were to be visited . Mary deplored the necessity for herself . \" Nobody knew how much she should suffer . She should put it off as long as she could ; \" but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back . Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going . She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression . Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour . Anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft 's side , to give a bias of any sort . She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft 's suddenly saying,-- \" It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country . \" Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not . \" Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ? \" added Mrs Croft . She could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when Mrs Croft 's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother . She immediately felt how reasonable it was , that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward , and not of Frederick ; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour 's present state with proper interest . The rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the Admiral say to Mary-- \" We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft 's here soon ; I dare say you know him by name . \" He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c. , to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question . She could not , however , reach such a degree of certainty , as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house , where the Crofts had previously been calling . The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in . That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted , when Louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage . \" And I will tell you our reason , \" she added , \" and all about it . I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard ! And we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano - forte . I will tell you why she is out of spirits . When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ? ) , they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma 's head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard 's captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! And upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor Richard ! So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things . \" The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were , that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome , hopeless son ; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year ; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore ; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family , though quite as much as he deserved ; seldom heard of , and scarcely at all regretted , when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross , two years before . He had , in fact , though his sisters were now doing all they could for him , by calling him \" poor Richard , \" been nothing better than a thick - headed , unfeeling , unprofitable Dick Musgrove , who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name , living or dead . He had been several years at sea , and had , in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable , and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of , been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth 's frigate , the Laconia ; and from the Laconia he had , under the influence of his captain , written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence ; that is to say , the only two disinterested letters ; all the rest had been mere applications for money . In each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of Wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur . She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re - perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death . Mr Musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them . To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it might , that it probably would , turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from Clifton -- a very fine young man -- but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to Anne 's nerves . She found , however , that it was one to which she must inure herself . Since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points . And not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the Musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor Dick 's having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well - spelt praise , as \" a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster , \" were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival . The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Anne"}, {"position": [46, 47], "text": "She"}, {"position": [68,
