{"document": "20 Sir Walter , his two daughters , and Mrs Clay , were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room . But hardly were they so settled , when the door opened again , and Captain Wentworth walked in alone . Anne was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke . He was preparing only to bow and pass on , but her gentle \" How do you do ? \" brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground . Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done . While they were speaking , a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear . She could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on Captain Wentworth 's making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself . This , though late , and reluctant , and ungracious , was yet better than nothing , and her spirits improved . After talking , however , of the weather , and Bath , and the concert , their conversation began to flag , and so little was said at last , that she was expecting him to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said-- \" I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme . I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time . \" She assured him that she had not . \" It was a frightful hour , \" said he , \" a frightful day ! \" and he passed his hand across his eyes , as if the remembrance were still too painful , but in a moment , half smiling again , added , \" The day has produced some effects however ; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful . When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon , you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery . \" \" Certainly I could have none . But it appears -- I should hope it would be a very happy match . There are on both sides good principles and good temper . \" \" Yes , \" said he , looking not exactly forward ; \" but there , I think , ends the resemblance . With all my soul I wish them happy , and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it . They have no difficulties to contend with at home , no opposition , no caprice , no delays . The Musgroves are behaving like themselves , most honourably and kindly , only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter 's comfort . All this is much , very much in favour of their happiness ; more than perhaps-- \" He stopped . A sudden recollection seemed to occur , and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne 's cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground . After clearing his throat , however , he proceeded thus-- \" I confess that I do think there is a disparity , too great a disparity , and in a point no less essential than mind . I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable , sweet - tempered girl , and not deficient in understanding , but Benwick is something more . He is a clever man , a reading man ; and I confess , that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . But I have no reason to suppose it so . It seems , on the contrary , to have been a perfectly spontaneous , untaught feeling on his side , and this surprises me . A man like him , in his situation ! with a heart pierced , wounded , almost broken ! Fanny Harville was a very superior creature , and his attachment to her was indeed attachment . A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . He ought not ; he does not . \" Either from the consciousness , however , that his friend had recovered , or from other consciousness , he went no farther ; and Anne who , in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered , and in spite of all the various noises of the room , the almost ceaseless slam of the door , and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through , had distinguished every word , was struck , gratified , confused , and beginning to breathe very quick , and feel an hundred things in a moment . It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject ; and yet , after a pause , feeling the necessity of speaking , and having not the smallest wish for a total change , she only deviated so far as to say-- \" You were a good while at Lyme , I think ? \" \" About a fortnight . I could not leave it till Louisa 's doing well was quite ascertained . I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace . It had been my doing , solely mine . She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak . The country round Lyme is very fine . I walked and rode a great deal ; and the more I saw , the more I found to admire . \" \" I should very much like to see Lyme again , \" said Anne . \" Indeed ! I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling . The horror and distress you were involved in , the stretch of mind , the wear of spirits ! I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust . \" \" The last hours were certainly very painful , \" replied Anne ; \" but when pain is over , the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure . One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it , unless it has been all suffering , nothing but suffering , which was by no means the case at Lyme . We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . So much novelty and beauty ! I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short \" ( with a faint blush at some recollections ) , \" altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable . \" As she ceased , the entrance door opened again , and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting . \" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple , \" was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from Captain Wentworth . Their interesting , almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time , but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on ! She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards Louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations . She was in good humour with all . She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all , and to pity every one , as being less happy than herself . The delightful emotions were a little subdued , when on stepping back from the group , to be joined again by Captain Wentworth , she saw that he was gone . She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room . He was gone ; he had disappeared , she felt a moment 's regret . But \" they should meet again . He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder . She was in need of a little interval for recollection . \" Upon Lady Russell 's appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could . Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in . Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne 's felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister 's ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment . Anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room . Her happiness was from within . Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed ; but she knew nothing about it . She was thinking only of the last half hour , and as they passed to their seats , her mind took a hasty range over it . His choice of subjects , his expressions , and still more his manner and look , had been such as she could see in only one light . His opinion of Louisa Musgrove 's inferiority , an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give , his wonder at Captain Benwick , his feelings as to a first , strong attachment ; sentences begun which he could not finish , his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance , all , all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least ; that anger , resentment , avoidance , were no more ; and that they were succeeded , not merely by friendship and regard , but by the tenderness of the past . Yes , some share of the tenderness of the past . She could not contemplate the change as implying less . He must love her . These were thoughts , with their attendant visions , which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation ; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him , without even trying to discern him . When their places were determined on , and they were all properly arranged , she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room , but he was not ; her eye could not reach him ; and the concert being just opening , she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way . The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches : Anne was among those on the foremost , and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well , with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis , as to have a seat by her . Miss Elliot , surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of Colonel Wallis 's gallantry , was quite contented . Anne 's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening ; it was just occupation enough : she had feelings for the tender , spirits for the gay , attention for the scientific , and patience for the wearisome ; and had never liked a concert better , at least during the first act . Towards the close of it , in the interval succeeding an Italian song , she explained the words of the song to Mr Elliot . They had a concert bill between them . \" This , \" said she , \" is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language . I am a very poor Italian scholar . \" \" Yes , yes , I see you are . I see you know nothing of the matter . You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted , transposed , curtailed Italian lines , into clear , comprehensible , elegant English . You need not say anything more of your ignorance . Here is complete proof . \" \" I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient . \" \" I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long , \" replied he , \" without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot ; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman . \" \" For shame ! for shame ! this is too much flattery . I forget what we are to have next , \" turning to the bill . \" Perhaps , \" said Mr Elliot , speaking low , \" I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . \" \" Indeed ! How so ? You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family . \" \" I knew you by report long before you came to Bath . I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . I have been acquainted with you by character many years . Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me . \" Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise . No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery . To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance , by nameless people , is irresistible ; and Anne was all curiosity . She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain . He delighted in being asked , but he would not tell . \" No , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now . He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . \" Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford , Captain Wentworth 's brother . He might have been in Mr Elliot 's company , but she had not courage to ask the question . \" The name of Anne Elliot , \" said he , \" has long had an interesting sound to me . Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if I dared , I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change . \" Such , she believed , were his words ; but scarcely had she received their sound , than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her , which rendered every thing else trivial . Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking . \" A well - looking man , \" said Sir Walter , \" a very well - looking man . \" \" A very fine young man indeed ! \" said Lady Dalrymple . \" More air than one often sees in Bath . Irish , I dare say . \" \" No , I just know his name . A bowing acquaintance . Wentworth ; Captain Wentworth of the navy . His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch . \" Before Sir Walter had reached this point , Anne 's eyes had caught the right direction , and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance . As her eyes fell on him , his seemed to be withdrawn from her . It had that appearance . It seemed as if she had been one moment too late ; and as long as she dared observe , he did not look again : but the performance was recommencing , and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward . When she could give another glance , he had moved away . He could not have come nearer to her if he would ; she was so surrounded and shut in : but she would rather have caught his eye . Mr Elliot 's speech , too , distressed her . She had no longer any inclination to talk to him . She wished him not so near her . The first act was over . Now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing - saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea . Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move . She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell 's account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity . She was persuaded by Lady Russell 's countenance that she had seen him . He did not come however . Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance , but he never came . The anxious interval wore away unproductively . The others returned , the room filled again , benches were reclaimed and repossessed , and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out , another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes , as real or affected taste for it prevailed . To Anne , it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation . She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more , without the interchange of one friendly look . In re - settling themselves there were now many changes , the result of which was favourable for her . Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again , and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret , in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own , Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer - by . She could not do so , without comparing herself with Miss Larolles , the inimitable Miss Larolles ; but still she did it , and not with much happier effect ; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours , she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed . Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when Captain Wentworth was again in sight . She saw him not far off . He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . She felt that something must be the matter . The change was indubitable . The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great . Why was it ? She thought of her father , of Lady Russell . Could there have been any unpleasant glances ? He began by speaking of the concert gravely , more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross ; owned himself disappointed , had expected singing ; and in short , must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over . Anne replied , and spoke in defence of the performance so well , and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly , that his countenance improved , and he replied again with almost a smile . They talked for a few minutes more ; the improvement held ; he even looked down towards the bench , as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying ; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round . It came from Mr Elliot . He begged her pardon , but she must be applied to , to explain Italian again . Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung . Anne could not refuse ; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit . A few minutes , though as few as possible , were inevitably consumed ; and when her own mistress again , when able to turn and look as she had done before , she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth , in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell . \" He must wish her good night ; he was going ; he should get home as fast as he could . \" \" Is not this song worth staying for ? \" said Anne , suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging . \" No ! \" he replied impressively , \" there is nothing worth my staying for ; \" and he was gone directly . Jealousy of Mr Elliot ! It was the only intelligible motive . Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection ! Could she have believed it a week ago ; three hours ago ! For a moment the gratification was exquisite . But , alas ! there were very different thoughts to succeed . How was such jealousy to be quieted ? How was the truth to reach him ? How , in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations , would he ever learn of her real sentiments ? It was misery to think of Mr Elliot 's attentions . Their evil was incalculable .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Sir Walter"}, {"position": [4, 5], "text": "his"}, {"position": [1382, 1384], "text": "Sir Walter"},
