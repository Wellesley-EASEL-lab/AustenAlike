{"document": "5 On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft 's seeing Kellynch Hall , Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell 's , and keep out of the way till all was over ; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them . This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once . Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the Admiral 's side , as could not but influence Sir Walter , who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd 's assurances of his being known , by report , to the Admiral , as a model of good breeding . The house and grounds , and furniture , were approved , the Crofts were approved , terms , time , every thing , and every body , was right ; and Mr Shepherd 's clerks were set to work , without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that \" This indenture sheweth . \" Sir Walter , without hesitation , declared the Admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the Admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , \" I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton . The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . \" reciprocal compliments , which would have been esteemed about equal . The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas ; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month , there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement . Lady Russell , convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath , and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country , did not think that , everything considered , she wished to remain . It would be most right , and most wise , and , therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others . Something occurred , however , to give her a different duty . Mary , often a little unwell , and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints , and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter , was indisposed ; and foreseeing that she should not have a day 's health all the autumn , entreated , or rather required her , for it was hardly entreaty , to come to Uppercross Cottage , and bear her company as long as she should want her , instead of going to Bath . \" I can not possibly do without Anne , \" was Mary 's reasoning ; and Elizabeth 's reply was , \" Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath . \" To be claimed as a good , though in an improper style , is at least better than being rejected as no good at all ; and Anne , glad to be thought of some use , glad to have anything marked out as a duty , and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country , and her own dear country , readily agreed to stay . This invitation of Mary 's removed all Lady Russell 's difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge . So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay 's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her . Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to Anne , in Mrs Clay 's being of so much use , while Anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation . Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell . With a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father 's character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible . She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind . Mrs Clay had freckles , and a projecting tooth , and a clumsy wrist , which he was continually making severe remarks upon , in her absence ; but she was young , and certainly altogether well - looking , and possessed , in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners , infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been . Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister . She had little hope of success ; but Elizabeth , who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself , should never , she thought , have reason to reproach her for giving no warning . She spoke , and seemed only to offend . Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her , and indignantly answered for each party 's perfectly knowing their situation . \" Mrs Clay , \" said she , warmly , \" never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people . And as to my father , I really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now . If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety . One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times . That tooth of her 's and those freckles . Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him . I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them . You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay 's freckles . \" \" There is hardly any personal defect , \" replied Anne , \" which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to . \" \" I think very differently , \" answered Elizabeth , shortly ; \" an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones . However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me . \" Anne had done ; glad that it was over , and not absolutely hopeless of doing good . Elizabeth , though resenting the suspicion , might yet be made observant by it . The last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw Sir Walter , Miss Elliot , and Mrs Clay to Bath . The party drove off in very good spirits ; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves , and Anne walked up at the same time , in a sort of desolate tranquillity , to the Lodge , where she was to spend the first week . Her friend was not in better spirits than herself . Lady Russell felt this break - up of the family exceedingly . Their respectability was as dear to her as her own , and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit . It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne . Accordingly their removal was made together , and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage , in the first stage of Lady Russell 's journey . Uppercross was a moderate - sized village , which a few years back had been completely in the old English style , containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers ; the mansion of the squire , with its high walls , great gates , and old trees , substantial and unmodernized , and the compact , tight parsonage , enclosed in its own neat garden , with a vine and a pear - tree trained round its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ' squire , it had received the improvement of a farm - house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and Uppercross Cottage , with its veranda , French windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller 's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House , about a quarter of a mile farther on . Here Anne had often been staying . She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch . The two families were so continually meeting , so much in the habit of running in and out of each other 's house at all hours , that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone ; but being alone , her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course . Though better endowed than the elder sister , Mary had not Anne 's understanding nor temper . While well , and happy , and properly attended to , she had great good humour and excellent spirits ; but any indisposition sunk her completely . She had no resources for solitude ; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self - importance , was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill - used . In person , she was inferior to both sisters , and had , even in her bloom , only reached the dignity of being \" a fine girl . \" She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing - room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on Anne 's appearing , greeted her with-- \" So , you are come at last ! I began to think I should never see you . I am so ill I can hardly speak . I have not seen a creature the whole morning ! \" \" I am sorry to find you unwell , \" replied Anne . \" You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday ! \" \" Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure . Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way , and not able to ring the bell ! So , Lady Russell would not get out . I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . \" Anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband . \" Oh ! Charles is out shooting . I have not seen him since seven o'clock . He would go , though I told him how ill I was . He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one . I assure you , I have not seen a soul this whole long morning . \" \" You have had your little boys with you ? \" \" Yes , as long as I could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good . Little Charles does not mind a word I say , and Walter is growing quite as bad . \" \" Well , you will soon be better now , \" replied Anne , cheerfully . \" You know I always cure you when I come . How are your neighbours at the Great House ? \" \" I can give you no account of them . I have not seen one of them to - day , except Mr Musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me . It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves , I suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way . \" \" You will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone . It is early . \" \" I never want them , I assure you . They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me . Oh ! Anne , I am so very unwell ! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday . \" \" My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself ! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . \" \" Dear me ! what can you possibly have to do ? \" \" A great many things , I assure you . More than I can recollect in a moment ; but I can tell you some . I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father 's books and pictures . I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of Elizabeth 's plants are for Lady Russell . I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do , Mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave . I was told that they wished it . But all these things took up a great deal of time . \" \" Oh ! well ! \" and after a moment 's pause , \" but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday . \" \" Did you go then ? I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party . \" \" Oh yes ! I went . I was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning . It would have been strange if I had not gone . \" \" I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party . \" \" Nothing remarkable . One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one 's own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward . So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise ; and I think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it . \" A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne 's side produced nearly a cure on Mary 's . She could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time . Then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk . \" Where shall we go ? \" said she , when they were ready . \" I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you ? \" \" I have not the smallest objection on that account , \" replied Anne . \" I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves . \" \" Oh ! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible . They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister . However , we may as well go and sit with them a little while , and when we have that over , we can enjoy our walk . \" Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it . To the Great House accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old - fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano - forte and a harp , flower - stands and little tables placed in every direction . Oh ! could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot , could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on , have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness ! The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment . The Musgroves , like their houses , were in a state of alteration , perhaps of improvement . The father and mother were in the old English style , and the young people in the new . Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very good sort of people ; friendly and hospitable , not much educated , and not at all elegant . Their children had more modern minds and manners . There was a numerous family ; but the only two grown up , excepting Charles , were Henrietta and Louisa , young ladies of nineteen and twenty , who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments , and were now like thousands of other young ladies , living to be fashionable , happy , and merry . Their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad . Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance ; but still , saved as we all are , by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange , she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments ; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together , that good - humoured mutual affection , of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters . They were received with great cordiality . Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family , which was generally , as Anne very well knew , the least to blame . The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough ; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it , to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves , at Mary 's particular invitation
