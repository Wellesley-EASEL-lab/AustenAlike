{"document": "2 Mr Shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter , would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted . Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration . She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities , whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great , from the opposition of two leading principles . She was of strict integrity herself , with a delicate sense of honour ; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter 's feelings , as solicitous for the credit of the family , as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them , as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding . She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . Herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and Sir Walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of Anne and her sisters , was , as being Sir Walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt . But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth . She drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted Anne , who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question . She consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter . Every emendation of Anne 's had been on the side of honesty against importance . She wanted more vigorous measures , a more complete reformation , a quicker release from debt , a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity . \" If we can persuade your father to all this , \" said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , \" much may be done . If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . \" This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . She wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated Lady Russell 's influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation . Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell 's too gentle reductions . How Anne 's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence . Lady Russell 's had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne . \" What ! every comfort of life knocked off ! Journeys , London , servants , horses , table-- contractions and restrictions every where ! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman ! No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms . \" \" Quit Kellynch Hall . \" The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd , whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter 's retrenching , and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode . \" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , \" he said , \" in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side . It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support . In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household . \" Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out . There had been three alternatives , London , Bath , or another house in the country . All Anne 's wishes had been for the latter . A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have Lady Russell 's society , still be near Mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition . But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home . Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred . It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament : he might there be important at comparatively little expense . Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell 's spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there . Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne 's known wishes . It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood . Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to Sir Walter 's feelings they must have been dreadful . And with regard to Anne 's dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother 's death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend 's health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good . Anne had been too little from home , too little seen . Her spirits were not high . A larger society would improve them . She wanted her to be more known . The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part , and a very material part of the scheme , which had been happily engrafted on the beginning . He was not only to quit his home , but to see it in the hands of others ; a trial of fortitude , which stronger heads than Sir Walter 's have found too much . Kellynch Hall was to be let . This , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle . Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house . Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word \" advertise , \" but never dared approach it again . Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all . How quick come the reasons for approving what we like ! Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand , for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country . Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted . It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father 's house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve . Lady Russell , indeed , had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth , and seemed to love her , rather because she would love her , than because Elizabeth deserved it . She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility . From situation , Mrs Clay was , in Lady Russell 's estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot 's reach , was therefore an object of first - rate importance .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Mr Shepherd"},
