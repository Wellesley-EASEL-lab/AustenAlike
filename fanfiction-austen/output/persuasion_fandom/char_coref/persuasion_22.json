{"document": "22 Anne went home to think over all that she had heard . In one point , her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot . There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him . He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth , in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness ; and the evil of his attentions last night , the irremediable mischief he might have done , was considered with sensations unqualified , unperplexed . Pity for him was all over . But this was the only point of relief . In every other respect , in looking around her , or penetrating forward , she saw more to distrust and to apprehend . She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him . She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith , but here was a reward indeed springing from it ! Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done . Could the knowledge have been extended through her family ? But this was a vain idea . She must talk to Lady Russell , tell her , consult with her , and having done her best , wait the event with as much composure as possible ; and after all , her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell ; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself . She found , on reaching home , that she had , as she intended , escaped seeing Mr Elliot ; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit ; but hardly had she congratulated herself , and felt safe , when she heard that he was coming again in the evening . \" I had not the smallest intention of asking him , \" said Elizabeth , with affected carelessness , \" but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least . \" \" Indeed , I do say it . I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation . Poor man ! I was really in pain for him ; for your hard - hearted sister , Miss Anne , seems bent on cruelty . \" \" Oh ! \" cried Elizabeth , \" I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman 's hints . However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together . They appear to so much advantage in company with each other . Each behaving so pleasantly . Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect . \" \" Quite delightful ! \" cried Mrs Clay , not daring , however , to turn her eyes towards Anne . \" Exactly like father and son ! Dear Miss Elliot , may I not say father and son ? \" \" Oh ! I lay no embargo on any body 's words . If you will have such ideas ! But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men . \" \" My dear Miss Elliot ! \" exclaimed Mrs Clay , lifting her hands and eyes , and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence . \" Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him . I did invite him , you know . I sent him away with smiles . When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him . \" Anne admired the good acting of the friend , in being able to shew such pleasure as she did , in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object . It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot ; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise . To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room ; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her . She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere , but now she saw insincerity in everything . His attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith , she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments . She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along . She was accordingly more guarded , and more cool , than she had been the night before . He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised ; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation ; but the charm was broken : he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin 's vanity ; he found , at least , that it was not to be done now , by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too - commanding claims of the others . He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest , bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable . She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning , going early , and that he would be gone the greater part of two days . He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of his return ; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain . It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them ! Mrs Clay 's selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his ; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once , with all its evils , to be clear of Mr Elliot 's subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it . On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell , and accomplish the necessary communication ; and she would have gone directly after breakfast , but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble , which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion . She saw Mrs Clay fairly off , therefore , before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street . \" Very well , \" said Elizabeth , \" I have nothing to send but my love . Oh ! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through . I really can not be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out . Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications . You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night . I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert . Something so formal and arrange in her air ! and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course . \" \" And mine , \" added Sir Walter . \" Kindest regards . And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon . Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately . \" While her father spoke , there was a knock at the door . Who could it be ? Anne , remembering the preconcerted visits , at all hours , of Mr Elliot , would have expected him , but for his known engagement seven miles off . After the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and \" Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove \" were ushered into the room . Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but Anne was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well . They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of . She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove , Henrietta , and Captain Harville , beside their two selves . He gave her a very plain , intelligible account of the whole ; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding . The scheme had received its first impulse by Captain Harville 's wanting to come to Bath on business . He had begun to talk of it a week ago ; and by way of doing something , as shooting was over , Charles had proposed coming with him , and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much , as an advantage to her husband ; but Mary could not bear to be left , and had made herself so unhappy about it , that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense , or at an end . But then , it had been taken up by his father and mother . His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding - clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother 's party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville ; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience . They had arrived late the night before . Mrs Harville , her children , and Captain Benwick , remained with Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross . Anne 's only surprise was , that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta 's wedding - clothes to be talked of . She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand ; but she learned from Charles that , very recently , ( since Mary 's last letter to herself ) , Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years ; and that on the strength of his present income , with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question , the two families had consented to the young people 's wishes , and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months , quite as soon as Louisa 's . \" And a very good living it was , \" Charles added : \" only five - and - twenty miles from Uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of Dorsetshire . In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least , Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation . Not that he will value it as he ought , \" he observed , \" Charles is too cool about sporting . That 's the worst of him . \" \" I am extremely glad , indeed , \" cried Anne , \" particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other-- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . \" \" Oh ! yes . My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find . Money , you know , coming down with money -- two daughters at once -- it can not be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things . However , I do not mean to say they have not a right to it . It is very fit they should have daughters ' shares ; and I am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me . Mary does not above half like Henrietta 's match . She never did , you know . But she does not do him justice , nor think enough about Winthrop . I can not make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now . \" \" Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , \" exclaimed Anne , \" should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? \" He answered rather hesitatingly , \" Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long . \" Anne could not help laughing . \" That can not be much to your taste , I know , \" said she ; \" but I do believe him to be an excellent young man . \" \" To be sure he is . Nobody doubts it ; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself . I have a great value for Benwick ; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say . His reading has done him no harm , for he has fought as well as read . He is a brave fellow . I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before . We had a famous set - to at rat - hunting all the morning in my father 's great barns ; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since . \" Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles 's following the others to admire mirrors and china ; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross , and rejoice in its happiness ; and though she sighed as she rejoiced , her sigh had none of the ill - will of envy in it . She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could , but she did not want to lessen theirs . The visit passed off altogether in high good humour . Mary was in excellent spirits , enjoying the gaiety and the change , and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother - in - law 's carriage with four horses , and with her own complete independence of Camden Place , that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought , and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house , as they were detailed to her . She had no demands on her father or sister , and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing - rooms . Elizabeth was , for a short time , suffering a good deal . She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them ; but she could not bear to have the difference of style , the reduction of servants , which a dinner must betray , witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch . It was a struggle between propriety and vanity ; but vanity got the better , and then Elizabeth was happy again . These were her internal persuasions : \" Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister 's family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove ; put her quite out of her way . I am sure she would rather not come ; she can not feel easy with us . I will ask them all for an evening ; that will be much better ; that will be a novelty and a treat . They have not seen two such drawing rooms before . They will be delighted to come to - morrow evening . It shall be a regular party , small , but most elegant . \" And this satisfied Elizabeth : and when the invitation was given to the two present , and promised for the absent , Mary was as completely satisfied . She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot , and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention . Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning ; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary , to go and see her and Henrietta directly . Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present . They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes ; but Anne convinced herself that a day 's delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence , and hastened forward to the White Hart , to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn , with an eagerness of good - will which many associations contributed to form . They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and Anne had the kindest welcome from each . Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently - improved views , of fresh - formed happiness , which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all ; and Mrs Musgrove 's real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress . It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining . A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected . A large party in an hotel ensured a quick - changing , unsettled scene . One five minutes brought a note , the next a parcel ; and Anne had not been there half an hour , when their dining - room , spacious as it was , seemed more than half filled : a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove , and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth . The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment . It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again . Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings ; she had derived from it a delightful conviction ; but she feared from his looks , that the same unfortunate persuasion , which had hastened him away from the Concert Room , still governed . He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation . She tried to be calm , and leave things to take their course , and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:-- \" Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long . We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment 's inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness . \" And yet , a few minutes afterwards , she felt as if their being in company with each other , under their present circumstances , could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind . \" Anne , \" cried Mary , still at her window , \" there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her . I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now . They seemed deep in talk . Who is it ? Come , and tell me . Good heavens ! I recollect . It is Mr Elliot himself . \" \" No , \" cried Anne , quickly , \" it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . \" As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was . Mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot , calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself , but Anne did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned . Her distress returned , however , on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors , as if they believed themselves quite in the secret . It was evident that the report concerning her had spread , and a short pause succeeded , which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther . \" Do come , Anne \" cried Mary , \" come and look yourself . You will be too late if you do not make haste . They are parting ; they are shaking hands . He is turning away . Not know Mr Elliot , indeed ! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme . \" To pacify Mary , and perhaps screen her own embarrassment , Anne did move quietly to the window . She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot , which she had never believed , before he disappeared on one side , as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other ; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest , she calmly said , \" Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; \" and walked back to her chair , recomposed , and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well . The visitors took their leave ; and Charles , having civilly seen them off , and then made a face at them , and abused them for coming , began with-- \" Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like . I have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to - morrow night . A'n't I a good boy ? I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all . It holds nine . I have engaged Captain Wentworth . Anne will not be sorry to join us , I am sure . We all like a play . Have not I done well , mother ? \" Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play , if Henrietta and all the others liked it , when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming-- \" Good heavens , Charles ! how can you think of such a thing ? Take a box for to - morrow night ! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to - morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter , and Mr Elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ? How can you be so forgetful ? \" \" Phoo ! phoo ! \" replied Charles , \" what 's an evening party ? Never worth remembering . Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us . You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play . \" \" Oh ! Charles , I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go . \" \" No , I did not promise . I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ` happy . ' There was no promise . \" \" But you must go , Charles . It would be unpardonable to fail . We were asked on purpose to be introduced . There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves . Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately . We are quite near relations , you know ; and Mr Elliot too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with ! Every attention is due to Mr Elliot . Consider , my father 's heir : the future representative of the family . \" \" Do n't talk to me about heirs and representatives , \" cried Charles . \" I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . What is Mr Elliot to me ? \" The careless expression was life to Anne , who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself . Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her . Mrs Musgrove interposed . \" We had better put it off . Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday . It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . \" Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying-- \" If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary 's account ) would not be the smallest impediment . I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps . \" She had spoken it ; but she trembled when it was done , conscious that her words were listened to , and daring not even to try to observe their effect . It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day ; Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife , by persisting that he would go to the play to - morrow if nobody else would . Captain Wentworth left his seat , and walked to the fire - place ; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards , and taking a station , with less bare - faced design , by Anne . \" You have not been long enough in Bath , \" said he , \" to enjoy the evening parties of the place . \" \" Oh ! no . The usual character of them has nothing for me . I am no card - player . \" \" You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes . \" \" I am not yet so much changed , \" cried Anne , and stopped , fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction . After waiting a few moments he said , and as if it were the result of immediate feeling , \" It is a period , indeed ! Eight years and a half is a period . \" Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne 's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in . They were obliged to move . Anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her . Their preparations , however , were stopped short . Alarming sounds were heard ; other visitors approached , and the door was thrown open for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot , whose entrance seemed to give a general chill . Anne felt an instant oppression , and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same . The comfort , the freedom , the gaiety of the room was over , hushed into cold composure , determined silence , or insipid talk , to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister . How mortifying to feel that it was so ! Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular . Captain Wentworth was acknowledged again by each , by Elizabeth more graciously than before . She even addressed him once , and looked at him more than once . Elizabeth was , in fact , revolving a great measure . The sequel explained it . After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings , she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves . \" To - morrow evening , to meet a few friends : no formal party . \" It was all said very gracefully , and the cards with which she had provided herself , the \" Miss Elliot at home , \" were laid on the table , with a courteous , comprehensive smile to all , and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth . The truth was , that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his . The past was nothing . The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing - room . The card was pointedly given , and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared . The interruption had been short , though severe , and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out , but not to Anne . She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . She knew him ; she saw disdain in his eye , and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering , as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . Her spirits sank . He held the card in his hand after they were gone , as if deeply considering it . \" Only think of Elizabeth 's including everybody ! \" whispered Mary very audibly . \" I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted ! You see he can not put the card out of his hand . \" Anne caught his eye , saw his cheeks glow , and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt , and turned away , that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her . The party separated . The gentlemen had their own pursuits , the ladies proceeded on their own business , and they met no more while Anne belonged to them . She was earnestly begged to return and dine , and give them all the rest of the day , but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more , and fit only for home , where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose . Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow 's party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath , while harassing herself with the never - ending question , of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not ? They were reckoning him as certain , but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together . She generally thought he would come , because she generally thought he ought ; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion , as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings . She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay 's face as she listened . It was transient : cleared away in an instant ; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having , by some complication of mutual trick , or some overbearing authority of his , been obliged to attend ( perhaps for half an hour ) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter . She exclaimed , however , with a very tolerable imitation of nature : -- \" Oh ! dear ! very true . Only think , Miss Elliot , to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street . I was never more astonished . He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard . He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to - morrow . He was full of ` to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Anne"}, {"position": [9, 10], "text": "she"}, {"position": [17, 18], "text":
