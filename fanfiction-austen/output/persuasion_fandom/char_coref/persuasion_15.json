{"document": "15 Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place , a lofty dignified situation , such as becomes a man of consequence ; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there , much to their satisfaction . Anne entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself , \" Oh ! when shall I leave you again ? \" A degree of unexpected cordiality , however , in the welcome she received , did her good . Her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness . Her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage . Mrs Clay was very pleasant , and very smiling , but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course . Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival , but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for . They were evidently in excellent spirits , and she was soon to listen to the causes . They had no inclination to listen to her . After laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood , which Anne could not pay , they had only a few faint enquiries to make , before the talk must be all their own . Uppercross excited no interest , Kellynch very little : it was all Bath . They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect . Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place ; their drawing - rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of , and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting - up , or the taste of the furniture . Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after . Everybody was wanting to visit them . They had drawn back from many introductions , and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing . Here were funds of enjoyment . Could Anne wonder that her father and sister were happy ? She might not wonder , but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change , should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder , should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town ; and she must sigh , and smile , and wonder too , as Elizabeth threw open the folding - doors and walked with exultation from one drawing - room to the other , boasting of their space ; at the possibility of that woman , who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall , finding extent to be proud of between two walls , perhaps thirty feet asunder . But this was not all which they had to make them happy . They had Mr Elliot too . Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot . He was not only pardoned , they were delighted with him . He had been in Bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through Bath in November , in his way to London , when the intelligence of Sir Walter 's being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty - four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in Camden Place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re - established . They had not a fault to find in him . He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side . It had originated in misapprehension entirely . He had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent . Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours , he was quite indignant . He , who had ever boasted of being an Elliot , and whose feelings , as to connection , were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day . He was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it . He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject . The circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a Colonel Wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , Sir Walter added ) , who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it . Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story . She was certainly not a woman of family , but well educated , accomplished , rich , and excessively in love with his friend . There had been the charm . She had sought him . Without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted Elliot , and Sir Walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman . Here was a great deal to soften the business . A very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him ! Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation . Mr Elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place . Anne listened , but without quite understanding it . Allowances , large allowances , she knew , must be made for the ideas of those who spoke . She heard it all under embellishment . All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators . Still , however , she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared , in Mr Elliot 's wishing , after an interval of so many years , to be well received by them . In a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance . In all probability he was already the richer of the two , and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title . A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? She could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for Elizabeth 's sake . There might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her . Elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself . How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot 's frequent visits were talked of . Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme , but without being much attended to . \" Oh ! yes , perhaps , it had been Mr Elliot . They did not know . It might be him , perhaps . \" They could not listen to her description of him . They were describing him themselves ; Sir Walter especially . He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance , his air of elegance and fashion , his good shaped face , his sensible eye ; but , at the same time , \" must lament his being very much under - hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse . Mr Elliot appeared to think that he ( Sir Walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; \" but Sir Walter had \" not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him . He did not mean to complain , however . Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . \" Mr Elliot , and his friends in Marlborough Buildings , were talked of the whole evening . \" Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them ! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should ! \" and there was a Mrs Wallis , at present known only to them by description , as she was in daily expectation of her confinement ; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as \" a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in Camden Place , \" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted . Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis ; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman , beautiful . \" He longed to see her . He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets . The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women . He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women , but the number of the plain was out of all proportion . He had frequently observed , as he walked , that one handsome face would be followed by thirty , or five - and - thirty frights ; and once , as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street , he had counted eighty - seven women go by , one after another , without there being a tolerable face among them . It had been a frosty morning , to be sure , a sharp frost , which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of . But still , there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath ; and as for the men ! they were infinitely worse . Such scarecrows as the streets were full of ! It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable , by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced . He had never walked anywhere arm - in - arm with Colonel Wallis ( who was a fine military figure , though sandy - haired ) without observing that every woman 's eye was upon him ; every woman 's eye was sure to be upon Colonel Wallis . \" Modest Sir Walter ! He was not allowed to escape , however . His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis 's companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis , and certainly was not sandy - haired . \" How is Mary looking ? \" said Sir Walter , in the height of his good humour . \" The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day . \" \" Oh ! no , that must have been quite accidental . In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas . \" \" If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse . \" Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything . \" A knock at the door ! and so late ! It was ten o'clock . Could it be Mr Elliot ? They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent . It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did . They could think of no one else . Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot 's knock . \" Mrs Clay was right . With all the state which a butler and foot - boy could give , Mr Elliot was ushered into the room . It was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress . Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but \" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , \" & c. & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; \" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter \" ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ) ; and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was . He looked completely astonished , but not more astonished than pleased ; his eyes brightened ! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship , alluded to the past , and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already . He was quite as good - looking as he had appeared at Lyme , his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be , so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person 's manners . They were not the same , but they were , perhaps , equally good . He sat down with them , and improved their conversation very much . There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man . Ten minutes were enough to certify that . His tone , his expressions , his choice of subject , his knowing where to stop ; it was all the operation of a sensible , discerning mind . As soon as he could , he began to talk to her of Lyme , wanting to compare opinions respecting the place , but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time ; to give his own route , understand something of hers , and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her . She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme . His regret increased as he listened . He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself . If he had but asked who the party were ! The name of Musgrove would have told him enough . \" Well , it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn , which he had adopted , when quite a young man , on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious . \" The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty , \" said he , \" as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing , are more absurd , I believe , than those of any other set of beings in the world . The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view . \" But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone : he knew it ; he was soon diffused again among the others , and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme . His enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place . Having alluded to \" an accident , \" he must hear the whole . When he questioned , Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt . She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it . He staid an hour with them . The elegant little clock on the mantel- piece had struck \" eleven with its silver sounds , \" and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale , before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long . Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well !", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "Sir Walter"}, {"position": [28,
