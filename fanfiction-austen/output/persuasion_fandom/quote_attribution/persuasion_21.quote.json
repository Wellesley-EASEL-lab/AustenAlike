Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife 's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him . Mr Elliot , raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self - indulgence he had become a prudent man ) , and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend 's probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined . The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it . They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that Mr Elliot 's had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known . With a confidence in Mr Elliot 's regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but Mr Elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation . Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her . It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity ; and Anne felt , at some moments , that no flagrant open crime could have been worse . She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence . Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend 's usual state of mind . There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation . She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich . But there was nobody to stir in it . Mr Elliot would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money . She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel , and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law . This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means . To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear . It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne 's good offices with Mr Elliot . She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne 's feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot 's character would allow , when Anne 's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith 's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation . \""}, {"position": [8034, 8035], "text": "\""}, {"position": [8170, 8299], "text": "Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed .
