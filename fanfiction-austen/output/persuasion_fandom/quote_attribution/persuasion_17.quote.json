Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ` the best education in the world , ' know nothing worth attending to . Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour 's leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one 's species better .
