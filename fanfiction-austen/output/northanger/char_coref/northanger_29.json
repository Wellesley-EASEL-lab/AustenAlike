{"document": "29 Catherine was too wretched to be fearful . The journey in itself had no terrors for her ; and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness . Leaning back in one corner of the carriage , in a violent burst of tears , she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head ; and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it . Unfortunately , the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from Woodston ; and , for fourteen miles , every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different . Every mile , as it brought her nearer Woodston , added to her sufferings , and when within the distance of five , she passed the turning which led to it , and thought of Henry , so near , yet so unconscious , her grief and agitation were excessive . The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life . It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage . Yes , only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard \u2014 had he even confused her by his too significant reference ! and now \u2014 what had she done , or what had she omitted to do , to merit such a change ? The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge . Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained ; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each . Designedly , at least , Henry could not have betrayed her . If , indeed , by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for , of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations , she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation . If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer , she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house . But a justification so full of torture to herself , she trusted , would not be in his power . Anxious as were all her conjectures on this point , it was not , however , the one on which she dwelt most . There was a thought yet nearer , a more prevailing , more impetuous concern . How Henry would think , and feel , and look , when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her being gone , was a question of force and interest to rise over every other , to be never ceasing , alternately irritating and soothing ; it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence , and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment . To the General , of course , he would not dare to speak ; but to Eleanor \u2014 what might he not say to Eleanor about her ? In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries , on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose , the hours passed away , and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for . The pressing anxieties of thought , which prevented her from noticing anything before her , when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston , saved her at the same time from watching her progress ; and though no object on the road could engage a moment \u2019s attention , she found no stage of it tedious . From this , she was preserved too by another cause , by feeling no eagerness for her journey \u2019s conclusion ; for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best , even after an absence such as hers \u2014 an eleven weeks \u2019 absence . What had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family , that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it , extend an useless resentment , and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will ? She could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor \u2019s merit ; she felt it too strongly for expression ; and should a dislike be taken against them , should they be thought of unfavourably , on their father \u2019s account , it would cut her to the heart . With these feelings , she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well - known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home . Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger ; but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post - masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it ; so great had been her ignorance of her route . She met with nothing , however , to distress or frighten her . Her youth , civil manners , and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require ; and stopping only to change horses , she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm , and between six and seven o\u2019clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton . A heroine returning , at the close of her career , to her native village , in all the triumph of recovered reputation , and all the dignity of a countess , with a long train of noble relations in their several phaetons , and three waiting - maids in a travelling chaise and four , behind her , is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well delight to dwell ; it gives credit to every conclusion , and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestows . But my affair is widely different ; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and disgrace ; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness . A heroine in a hack post - chaise is such a blow upon sentiment , as no attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand . Swiftly therefore shall her post - boy drive through the village , amid the gaze of Sunday groups , and speedy shall be her descent from it . But , whatever might be the distress of Catherine \u2019s mind , as she thus advanced towards the parsonage , and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it , she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went ; first , in the appearance of her carriage \u2014 and secondly , in herself . The chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in Fullerton , the whole family were immediately at the window ; and to have it stop at the sweep - gate was a pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy \u2014 a pleasure quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children , a boy and girl of six and four years old , who expected a brother or sister in every carriage . Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine ! happy the voice that proclaimed the discovery ! but whether such happiness were the lawful property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood . Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine \u2019s heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible . So surrounded , so caressed , she was even happy ! in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued , and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity , they were all seated round the tea - table , which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller , whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice , before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her . Reluctantly , and with much hesitation , did she then begin what might perhaps , at the end of half an hour , be termed , by the courtesy of her hearers , an explanation ; but scarcely , within that time , could they at all discover the cause , or collect the particulars , of her sudden return . They were far from being an irritable race ; far from any quickness in catching , or bitterness in resenting , affronts : but here , when the whole was unfolded , was an insult not to be overlooked , nor , for the first half hour , to be easily pardoned . Without suffering any romantic alarm , in the consideration of their daughter \u2019s long and lonely journey , Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her ; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered ; and that , in forcing her on such a measure , General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly \u2014 neither as a gentleman nor as a parent . Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that \u201c it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , \u201d grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour . \u201c My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , \u201d said her mother at last ; \u201c depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . \u201d \u201c I can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , \u201d said Sarah , \u201c but why not do it civilly ? \u201d \u201c I am sorry for the young people , \u201d returned Mrs. Morland ; \u201c they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General Tilney . \u201d Catherine sighed . \u201c Well , \u201d continued her philosophic mother , \u201c I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done . It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets . \u201d Catherine hoped so too , and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment , but her spirits were quite worn down ; and , to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish , she readily agreed to her mother \u2019s next counsel of going early to bed . Her parents , seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings , and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey , parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away ; and though , when they all met the next morning , her recovery was not equal to their hopes , they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil . They never once thought of her heart , which , for the parents of a young lady of seventeen , just returned from her first excursion from home , was odd enough ! As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend \u2019s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure . The strength of these feelings , however , was far from assisting her pen ; and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor Tilney . To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation , convey gratitude without servile regret , be guarded without coldness , and honest without resentment \u2014 a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of \u2014 and , above all , which she might not blush herself , if Henry should chance to see , was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance ; and , after long thought and much perplexity , to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety . The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks , and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart . \u201c This has been a strange acquaintance , \u201d observed Mrs. Morland , as the letter was finished ; \u201c soon made and soon ended . I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella . Ah ! poor James ! well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . \u201d Catherine coloured as she warmly answered , \u201c No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . \u201d \u201c If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy . It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years ; and then what a pleasure it will be ! \u201d Mrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation . The hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into Catherine \u2019s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her . She could never forget Henry Tilney , or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment ; but he might forget her ; and in that case , to meet \u2014 ! her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James \u2019s disappointment . \u201c We are sorry for him , \u201d said she ; \u201c but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ; for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with , and who was so entirely without fortune ; and now , after such behaviour , we can not think at all well of her . Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice . \u201d This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could listen to ; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance , and made her reply less rational ; for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well - known road . It was not three months ago since , wild with joyful expectation , she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day , with an heart light , gay , and independent ; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed , and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it . Three months ago had seen her all this ; and now , how altered a being did she return ! She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked - for appearance , acting on a steady affection , would naturally call forth ; and great was their surprise , and warm their displeasure , on hearing how she had been treated \u2014 though Mrs. Morland \u2019s account of it was no inflated representation , no studied appeal to their passions . \u201c Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , \u201d said she . \u201c She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house . Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again ! and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . \u201d Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself . His wonder , his conjectures , and his explanations became in succession hers , with the addition of this single remark\u2014\u201cI really have not patience with the General\u201d\u2014to fill up every accidental pause . And , \u201c I really have not patience with the General , \u201d was uttered twice after Mr. Allen left the room , without any relaxation of anger , or any material digression of thought . A more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition ; and , after completing the fourth , she immediately added , \u201c Only think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was . I must show it you some day or other . Bath is a nice place , Catherine , after all . I assure you I did not above half like coming away . Mrs. Thorpe \u2019s being there was such a comfort to us , was not it ? You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . \u201d \u201c Yes , but _ that _ did not last long , \u201d said Catherine , her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there . \u201c Very true : we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe , and then we wanted for nothing . My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ? I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since . Do you remember that evening ? \u201d \u201c Do I ! oh ! perfectly . \u201d \u201c It was very agreeable , was not it ? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable . I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure . I remember I had my favourite gown on . \u201d Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to\u2014\u201cI really have not patience with the General ! such an agreeable , worthy man as he seemed to be ! i do not suppose , Mrs. Morland , you ever saw a better - bred man in your life . His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them , Catherine . But no wonder ; Milsom Street , you know . \u201d As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter \u2019s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends . There was a great deal of good sense in all this ; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power ; and Catherine \u2019s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced . It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 2], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [17, 18], "text": "her"}, {"position": [20, 21], "text": "she"}, {"position": [49, 50], "text":
