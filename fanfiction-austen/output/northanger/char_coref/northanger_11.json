{"document": "22 The housemaid \u2019s folding back her window - shutters at eight o\u2019clock the next day was the sound which first roused Catherine ; and she opened her eyes , wondering that they could ever have been closed , on objects of cheerfulness ; her fire was already burning , and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night . Instantaneously , with the consciousness of existence , returned her recollection of the manuscript ; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid \u2019s going away , she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground , and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow . She now plainly saw that she must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had shuddered over in books , for the roll , seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets , was altogether but of trifling size , and much less than she had supposed it to be at first . Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page . She started at its import . Could it be possible , or did not her senses play her false ? An inventory of linen , in coarse and modern characters , seemed all that was before her ! if the evidence of sight might be trusted , she held a washing - bill in her hand . She seized another sheet , and saw the same articles with little variation ; a third , a fourth , and a fifth presented nothing new . Shirts , stockings , cravats , and waistcoats faced her in each . Two others , penned by the same hand , marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting , in letters , hair - powder , shoe - string , and breeches - ball . And the larger sheet , which had enclosed the rest , seemed by its first cramp line , \u201c To poultice chestnut mare\u201d\u2014a farrier \u2019s bill ! such was the collection of papers ( left perhaps , as she could then suppose , by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them ) which had filled her with expectation and alarm , and robbed her of half her night \u2019s rest ! she felt humbled to the dust . Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom ? A corner of it , catching her eye as she lay , seemed to rise up in judgment against her . Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies . To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that , so modern , so habitable!\u2014Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet , the key of which was open to all ! How could she have so imposed on herself ? Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly ! and it was in a great measure his own doing , for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures , she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it . This was the only comfort that occurred . Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly , those detestable papers then scattered over the bed , she rose directly , and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before , returned them to the same spot within the cabinet , with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again , to disgrace her even with herself . Why the locks should have been so difficult to open , however , was still something remarkable , for she could now manage them with perfect ease . In this there was surely something mysterious , and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute , till the possibility of the door \u2019s having been at first unlocked , and of being herself its fastener , darted into her head , and cost her another blush . She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections , and found her way with all speed to the breakfast - parlour , as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before . Henry was alone in it ; and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest , with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited , was rather distressing . For the world would she not have her weakness suspected , and yet , unequal to an absolute falsehood , was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little . \u201c But we have a charming morning after it , \u201d she added , desiring to get rid of the subject ; \u201c and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over . What beautiful hyacinths ! i have just learnt to love a hyacinth . \u201d \u201c And how might you learn ? By accident or argument ? \u201d \u201c Your sister taught me ; I can not tell how . Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . \u201d \u201c But now you love a hyacinth . So much the better . You have gained a new source of enjoyment , and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible . Besides , a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex , as a means of getting you out of doors , and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take . And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic , who can tell , the sentiment once raised , but you may in time come to love a rose ? \u201d \u201c But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors . The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me , and in fine weather I am out more than half my time . Mamma says I am never within . \u201d \u201c At any rate , however , I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth . The mere habit of learning to love is the thing ; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing . Has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction ? \u201d Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the General , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind , but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure . The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine \u2019s notice when they were seated at table ; and , luckily , it had been the General \u2019s choice . He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste , confessed it to be neat and simple , thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country ; and for his part , to his uncritical palate , the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire , as from that of Dresden or S\u00eave . But this was quite an old set , purchased two years ago . The manufacture was much improved since that time ; he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town , and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind , might have been tempted to order a new set . He trusted , however , that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one \u2014 though not for himself . Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him . Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston , where business required and would keep him two or three days . They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse , and immediately on re - entering the breakfast - room , Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure . \u201c This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother \u2019s fortitude , \u201d observed the General to Eleanor . \u201c Woodston will make but a sombre appearance to - day . \u201d \u201c Is it a pretty place ? \u201d asked Catherine . \u201c What say you , Eleanor ? Speak your opinion , for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men . I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations . The house stands among fine meadows facing the south - east , with an excellent kitchen - garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son . It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one . Did Henry \u2019s income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill - provided for . Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business . But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment . The money is nothing , it is not an object , but employment is the thing . Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession . \u201d The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes . The silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable . Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house , and he now offered himself as her conductor ; and though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter , it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself , under any circumstances , not to be gladly accepted ; for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey , and had seen only a few of its rooms . The netting - box , just leisurely drawn forth , was closed with joyful haste , and she was ready to attend him in a moment . \u201c And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . \u201d She curtsied her acquiescence . \u201c But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object . The weather was at present favourable , and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so . Which would she prefer ? He was equally at her service . Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend \u2019s wishes ? But he thought he could discern . Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland \u2019s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather . But when did she judge amiss ? The abbey would be always safe and dry . He yielded implicitly , and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment . \u201d He left the room , and Catherine , with a disappointed , anxious face , began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination , under a mistaken idea of pleasing her ; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney \u2019s saying , with a little confusion , \u201c I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father \u2019s account ; he always walks out at this time of day . \u201d Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood . Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed ? Could there be any unwillingness on the General \u2019s side to show her over the abbey ? The proposal was his own . And was not it odd that he should _ always _ take his walk so early ? Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so . It was certainly very provoking . She was all impatience to see the house , and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds . If Henry had been with them indeed ! But now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it . Such were her thoughts , but she kept them to herself , and put on her bonnet in patient discontent . She was struck , however , beyond her expectation , by the grandeur of the abbey , as she saw it for the first time from the lawn . The whole building enclosed a large court ; and two sides of the quadrangle , rich in Gothic ornaments , stood forward for admiration . The remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees , or luxuriant plantations , and the steep woody hills rising behind , to give it shelter , were beautiful even in the leafless month of March . Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it ; and her feelings of delight were so strong , that without waiting for any better authority , she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise . The General listened with assenting gratitude ; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour . The kitchen - garden was to be next admired , and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park . The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay , being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen \u2019s , as well as her father \u2019s , including church - yard and orchard . The walls seemed countless in number , endless in length ; a village of hot - houses seemed to arise among them , and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure . The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , \u201c without any ambition of that sort himself \u2014 without any solicitude about it \u2014 he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom . If he had a hobby - horse , it was _ that _ . He loved a garden . Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit \u2014 or if he did not , his friends and children did . There were great vexations , however , attending such a garden as his . The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits . The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year . Mr. Allen , he supposed , must feel these inconveniences as well as himself . \u201d \u201c No , not at all . Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . \u201d With a triumphant smile of self - satisfaction , the General wished he could do the same , for he never entered his , without being vexed in some way or other , by its falling short of his plan . \u201c How were Mr. Allen \u2019s succession - houses worked ? \u201d describing the nature of his own as they entered them . \u201c Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then . \u201d \u201c He is a happy man ! \u201d said the General , with a look of very happy contempt . Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired . \u201c But where are you going , Eleanor ? Why do you choose that cold , damp path to it ? Miss Morland will get wet . Our best way is across the park . \u201d \u201c This is so favourite a walk of mine , \u201d said Miss Tilney , \u201c that I always think it the best and nearest way . But perhaps it may be damp . \u201d It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the General \u2019s disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward . He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition . He excused himself , however , from attending them : \u201c The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . \u201d He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . \u201c I am particularly fond of this spot , \u201d said her companion , with a sigh . \u201c It was my mother \u2019s favourite walk . \u201d Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before , and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance , and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more . \u201c I used to walk here so often with her ! \u201d added Eleanor ; \u201c though I never loved it then , as I have loved it since . At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice . But her memory endears it now . \u201d \u201c And ought it not , \u201d reflected Catherine , \u201c to endear it to her husband ? Yet the General would not enter it . \u201d Miss Tilney continuing silent , she ventured to say , \u201c Her death must have been a great affliction ! \u201d \u201c A great and increasing one , \u201d replied the other , in a low voice . \u201c I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . \u201d She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , \u201c I have no sister , you know \u2014 and though Henry \u2014 though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . \u201d \u201c To be sure you must miss him very much . \u201d \u201c A mother would have been always present . A mother would have been a constant friend ; her influence would have been beyond all other . \u201d \u201c Was she a very charming woman ? Was she handsome ? Was there any picture of her in the abbey ? And why had she been so partial to that grove ? Was it from dejection of spirits?\u201d\u2014were questions now eagerly poured forth ; the first three received a ready affirmative , the two others were passed by ; and Catherine \u2019s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question , whether answered or not . Of her unhappiness in marriage , she felt persuaded . The General certainly had been an unkind husband . He did not love her walk : could he therefore have loved her ? And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . \u201c Her picture , I suppose , \u201d blushing at the consummate art of her own question , \u201c hangs in your father \u2019s room ? \u201d \u201c No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place . Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber \u2014 where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . \u201d Here was another proof . A portrait \u2014 very like \u2014 of a departed wife , not valued by the husband ! he must have been dreadfully cruel to her ! Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which , in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited ; and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion . Yes , aversion ! his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her . She had often read of such characters , characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn ; but here was proof positive of the contrary . She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the General ; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation , she found herself again obliged to walk with him , listen to him , and even to smile when he smiled . Being no longer able , however , to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects , she soon began to walk with lassitude ; the General perceived it , and with a concern for her health , which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him , was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house . He would follow them in a quarter of an hour . Again they parted \u2014 but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return . This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable . 23 An hour passed away before the General came in , spent , on the part of his young guest , in no very favourable consideration of his character . \u201c This lengthened absence , these solitary rambles , did not speak a mind at ease , or a conscience void of reproach . \u201d At length he appeared ; and , whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations , he could still smile with _ them _ . Miss Tilney , understanding in part her friend \u2019s curiosity to see the house , soon revived the subject ; and her father being , contrary to Catherine \u2019s expectations , unprovided with any pretence for further delay , beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return , was at last ready to escort them . They set forward ; and , with a grandeur of air , a dignified step , which caught the eye , but could not shake the doubts of the well - read Catherine , he led the way across the hall , through the common drawing - room and one useless antechamber , into a room magnificent both in size and furniture \u2014 the real drawing - room , used only with company of consequence . It was very noble \u2014 very grand \u2014 very charming!\u2014was all that Catherine had to say , for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin ; and all minuteness of praise , all praise that had much meaning , was supplied by the General : the costliness or elegance of any room \u2019s fitting - up could be nothing to her ; she cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century . When the General had satisfied his own curiosity , in a close examination of every well - known ornament , they proceeded into the library , an apartment , in its way , of equal magnificence , exhibiting a collection of books , on which an humble man might have looked with pride . Catherine heard , admired , and wondered with more genuine feeling than before \u2014 gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge , by running over the titles of half a shelf , and was ready to proceed . But suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes . Large as was the building , she had already visited the greatest part ; though , on being told that , with the addition of the kitchen , the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court , she could scarcely believe it , or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted . It was some relief , however , that they were to return to the rooms in common use , by passing through a few of less importance , looking into the court , which , with occasional passages , not wholly unintricate , connected the different sides ; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister , having traces of cells pointed out , and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her \u2014 by finding herself successively in a billiard - room , and in the General \u2019s private apartment , without comprehending their connection , or being able to turn aright when she left them ; and lastly , by passing through a dark little room , owning Henry \u2019s authority , and strewed with his litter of books , guns , and greatcoats . From the dining - room , of which , though already seen , and always to be seen at five o\u2019clock , the General could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length , for the more certain information of Miss Morland , as to what she neither doubted nor cared for , they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen \u2014 the ancient kitchen of the convent , rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days , and in the stoves and hot closets of the present . The General \u2019s improving hand had not loitered here : every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this , their spacious theatre ; and , when the genius of others had failed , his own had often produced the perfection wanted . His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent . With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey ; the fourth side of the quadrangle having , on account of its decaying state , been removed by the General \u2019s father , and the present erected in its place . All that was venerable ceased here . The new building was not only new , but declared itself to be so ; intended only for offices , and enclosed behind by stable - yards , no uniformity of architecture had been thought necessary . Catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest , for the purposes of mere domestic economy ; and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen , had the General allowed it ; but if he had a vanity , it was in the arrangement of his offices ; and as he was convinced that , to a mind like Miss Morland \u2019s , a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened , must always be gratifying , he should make no apology for leading her on . They took a slight survey of all ; and Catherine was impressed , beyond her expectation , by their multiplicity and their convenience . The purposes for which a few shapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton , were here carried on in appropriate divisions , commodious and roomy . The number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices . Wherever they went , some pattened girl stopped to curtsy , or some footman in dishabille sneaked off . Yet this was an abbey ! how inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about \u2014 from abbeys and castles , in which , though certainly larger than Northanger , all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost . How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself . They returned to the hall , that the chief staircase might be ascended , and the beauty of its wood , and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out : having gained the top , they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which her room lay , and shortly entered one on the same plan , but superior in length and breadth . She was here shown successively into three large bed - chambers , with their dressing - rooms , most completely and handsomely fitted up ; everything that money and taste could do , to give comfort and elegance to apartments , had been bestowed on these ; and , being furnished within the last five years , they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing , and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine . As they were surveying the last , the General , after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured , turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine , and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be \u201c our friends from Fullerton . \u201d She felt the unexpected compliment , and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself , and so full of civility to all her family . The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?\u2014And what was there more to be seen?\u2014Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?\u2014And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ? Miss Tilney drew back directly , and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine , who , having seen , in a momentary glance beyond them , a narrower passage , more numerous openings , and symptoms of a winding staircase , believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice ; and felt , as she unwillingly paced back the gallery , that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest . The General \u2019s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant . Something was certainly to be concealed ; her fancy , though it had trespassed lately once or twice , could not mislead her here ; and what that something was , a short sentence of Miss Tilney \u2019s , as they followed the General at some distance downstairs , seemed to point out : \u201c I was going to take you into what was my mother \u2019s room \u2014 the room in which she died \u2014 \u201d were all her words ; but few as they were , they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine . It was no wonder that the General should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain ; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed , which released his suffering wife , and left him to the stings of conscience . She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour . Catherine understood her : the General must be watched from home , before that room could be entered . \u201c It remains as it was , I suppose ? \u201d said she , in a tone of feeling . \u201c Yes , entirely . \u201d \u201c And how long ago may it be that your mother died ? \u201d \u201c She has been dead these nine years . \u201d And nine years , Catherine knew , was a trifle of time , compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife , before her room was put to rights . \u201c You were with her , I suppose , to the last ? \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said Miss Tilney , sighing ; \u201c I was unfortunately from home . Her illness was sudden and short ; and , before I arrived it was all over . \u201d Catherine \u2019s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words . Could it be possible ? Could Henry \u2019s father \u2014 ? And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions ! and , when she saw him in the evening , while she worked with her friend , slowly pacing the drawing - room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness , with downcast eyes and contracted brow , she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him . It was the air and attitude of a Montoni ! what could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity , in its fearful review of past scenes of guilt ? Unhappy man ! and the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly , as to catch Miss Tilney \u2019s notice . \u201c My father , \u201d she whispered , \u201c often walks about the room in this way ; it is nothing unusual . \u201d \u201c So much the worse ! \u201d thought Catherine ; such ill - timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks , and boded nothing good . After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry \u2019s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell . When the butler would have lit his master \u2019s candle , however , he was forbidden . The latter was not going to retire . \u201c I have many pamphlets to finish , \u201d said he to Catherine , \u201c before I can close my eyes , and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep . Can either of us be more meetly employed ? _ My _ eyes will be blinding for the good of others , and _ yours _ preparing by rest for future mischief . \u201d But neither the business alleged , nor the magnificent compliment , could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose . To be kept up for hours , after the family were in bed , by stupid pamphlets was not very likely . There must be some deeper cause : something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept ; and the probability that Mrs. Tilney yet lived , shut up for causes unknown , and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food , was the conclusion which necessarily followed . Shocking as was the idea , it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened , as , in the natural course of things , she must ere long be released . The suddenness of her reputed illness , the absence of her daughter , and probably of her other children , at the time \u2014 all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment . Its origin \u2014 jealousy perhaps , or wanton cruelty \u2014 was yet to be unravelled . In revolving these matters , while she undressed , it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman \u2019s confinement \u2014 might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days ; for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division ? In the high - arched passage , paved with stone , which already she had trodden with peculiar awe , she well remembered the doors of which the General had given no account . To what might not those doors lead ? In support of the plausibility of this conjecture , it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery , in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney , must be , as certainly as her memory could guide her , exactly over this suspected range of cells , and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse , communicating by some secret means with those cells , might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband . Down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well - prepared insensibility ! Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises , and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far ; but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible . The side of the quadrangle , in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting , being , according to her belief , just opposite her own , it struck her that , if judiciously watched , some rays of light from the General \u2019s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows , as he passed to the prison of his wife ; and , twice before she stepped into bed , she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery , to see if it appeared ; but all abroad was dark , and it must yet be too early . The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up . Till midnight , she supposed it would be in vain to watch ; but then , when the clock had struck twelve , and all was quiet , she would , if not quite appalled by darkness , steal out and look once more . The clock struck twelve \u2014 and Catherine had been half an hour asleep .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "The housemaid"}, {"position": [6, 7], "text": "her"},
