{"document": "27 The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella : _ Bath , April _ My dearest Catherine , I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight , and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner . I really am quite ashamed of my idleness ; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing . I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath , but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other . Pray write to me soon , and direct to my own home . Thank God , we leave this vile place to - morrow . Since you went away , I have had no pleasure in it \u2014 the dust is beyond anything ; and everybody one cares for is gone . I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive . I am quite uneasy about your dear brother , not having heard from him since he went to Oxford ; and am fearful of some misunderstanding . Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it . The spring fashions are partly down ; and the hats the most frightful you can imagine . I hope you spend your time pleasantly , but am afraid you never think of me . I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together . I rejoice to say that the young man whom , of all others , I particularly abhor , has left Bath . You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away . Afterwards he got worse , and became quite my shadow . Many girls might have been taken in , for never were such attentions ; but I knew the fickle sex too well . He went away to his regiment two days ago , and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again . He is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw , and amazingly disagreeable . The last two days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis : I pitied his taste , but took no notice of him . The last time we met was in Bath Street , and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me ; I would not even look at him . He went into the pump - room afterwards ; but I would not have followed him for all the world . Such a contrast between him and your brother ! pray send me some news of the latter \u2014 I am quite unhappy about him ; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away , with a cold , or something that affected his spirits . I would write to him myself , but have mislaid his direction ; and , as I hinted above , am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss . Pray explain everything to his satisfaction ; or , if he still harbours any doubt , a line from himself to me , or a call at Putney when next in town , might set all to rights . I have not been to the Rooms this age , nor to the play , except going in last night with the Hodges , for a frolic , at half price : they teased me into it ; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone . We happened to sit by the Mitchells , and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out . I knew their spite : at one time they could not be civil to me , but now they are all friendship ; but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them . You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own . Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it \u2014 it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take . I wear nothing but purple now : I know I look hideous in it , but no matter \u2014 it is your dear brother \u2019s favourite colour . Lose no time , my dearest , sweetest Catherine , in writing to him and to me , Who ever am , etc . Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine . Its inconsistencies , contradictions , and falsehood struck her from the very first . She was ashamed of Isabella , and ashamed of having ever loved her . Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty , and her demands impudent . \u201c Write to James on her behalf ! no , James should never hear Isabella \u2019s name mentioned by her again . \u201d On Henry \u2019s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother \u2019s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation . When she had finished it\u2014\u201cSo much for Isabella , \u201d she cried , \u201c and for all our intimacy ! she must think me an idiot , or she could not have written so ; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her . I see what she has been about . She is a vain coquette , and her tricks have not answered . I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her . \u201d \u201c It will soon be as if you never had , \u201d said Henry . \u201c There is but one thing that I can not understand . I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time . Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ? \u201d \u201c I have very little to say for Frederick \u2019s motives , such as I believe them to have been . He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself . If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . \u201d \u201c Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ? \u201d \u201c I am persuaded that he never did . \u201d \u201c And only made believe to do so for mischief \u2019s sake ? \u201d Henry bowed his assent . \u201c Well , then , I must say that I do not like him at all . Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all . As it happens , there is no great harm done , because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose . But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? \u201d \u201c But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose \u2014 consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . \u201d \u201c It is very right that you should stand by your brother . \u201d \u201c And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe . But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . \u201d Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness . Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty , while Henry made himself so agreeable . She resolved on not answering Isabella \u2019s letter , and tried to think no more of it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 12], "text": "Isabella"}, {"position": [18, 19], "text":
