{"document": "21 A moment \u2019s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of . It was by no means unreasonably large , and contained neither tapestry nor velvet . The walls were papered , the floor was carpeted ; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those of the drawing - room below ; the furniture , though not of the latest fashion , was handsome and comfortable , and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful . Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point , she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything , as she greatly dreaded disobliging the General by any delay . Her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste , and she was preparing to unpin the linen package , which the chaise - seat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation , when her eye suddenly fell on a large high chest , standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace . The sight of it made her start ; and , forgetting everything else , she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder , while these thoughts crossed her : \u201c This is strange indeed ! i did not expect such a sight as this ! an immense heavy chest ! what can it hold ? Why should it be placed here ? Pushed back too , as if meant to be out of sight ! i will look into it \u2014 cost me what it may , I will look into it \u2014 and directly too \u2014 by daylight . If I stay till evening my candle may go out . \u201d She advanced and examined it closely : it was of cedar , curiously inlaid with some darker wood , and raised , about a foot from the ground , on a carved stand of the same . The lock was silver , though tarnished from age ; at each end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver , broken perhaps prematurely by some strange violence ; and , on the centre of the lid , was a mysterious cipher , in the same metal . Catherine bent over it intently , but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty . She could not , in whatever direction she took it , believe the last letter to be a _ T ; _ and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment . If not originally theirs , by what strange events could it have fallen into the Tilney family ? Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater ; and seizing , with trembling hands , the hasp of the lock , she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its contents . With difficulty , for something seemed to resist her efforts , she raised the lid a few inches ; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her , starting , quit her hold , and the lid closed with alarming violence . This ill - timed intruder was Miss Tilney \u2019s maid , sent by her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland ; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her , it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing , and forced her , in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery , to proceed in her dressing without further delay . Her progress was not quick , for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm ; and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt , she could not remain many paces from the chest . At length , however , having slipped one arm into her gown , her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged . One moment surely might be spared ; and , so desperate should be the exertion of her strength , that , unless secured by supernatural means , the lid in one moment should be thrown back . With this spirit she sprang forward , and her confidence did not deceive her . Her resolute effort threw back the lid , and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane , properly folded , reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession ! She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney , anxious for her friend \u2019s being ready , entered the room , and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation , was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search . \u201c That is a curious old chest , is not it ? \u201d said Miss Tilney , as Catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass . \u201c It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here . How it came to be first put in this room I know not , but I have not had it moved , because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets . The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open . In that corner , however , it is at least out of the way . \u201d Catherine had no leisure for speech , being at once blushing , tying her gown , and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch . Miss Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered \u201c Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ \u201d Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General \u2019s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace . The dining - parlour was a noble room , suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing - room than the one in common use , and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of Catherine , who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants . Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the General , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill - sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating - room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , \u201c that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen \u2019s ? \u201d \u201c No , indeed , \u201d was Catherine \u2019s honest assurance ; \u201c Mr. Allen \u2019s dining - parlour was not more than half as large , \u201d and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life . The General \u2019s good humour increased . Why , as he _ had _ such rooms , he thought it would be simple not to make use of them ; but , upon his honour , he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size . Mr. Allen \u2019s house , he was sure , must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness . The evening passed without any further disturbance , and , in the occasional absence of General Tilney , with much positive cheerfulness . It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey ; and even then , even in moments of languor or restraint , a sense of general happiness preponderated , and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them . The night was stormy ; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon ; and by the time the party broke up , it blew and rained violently . Catherine , as she crossed the hall , listened to the tempest with sensations of awe ; and , when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door , felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey . Yes , these were characteristic sounds ; they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes , which such buildings had witnessed , and such storms ushered in ; and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn ! _ She _ had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants . Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning . In a house so furnished , and so guarded , she could have nothing to explore or to suffer , and might go to her bedroom as securely as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton . Thus wisely fortifying her mind , as she proceeded upstairs , she was enabled , especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her , to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart ; and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire . \u201c How much better is this , \u201d said she , as she walked to the fender\u2014\u201chow much better to find a fire ready lit , than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed , as so many poor girls have been obliged to do , and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot ! how glad I am that Northanger is what it is ! if it had been like some other places , I do not know that , in such a night as this , I could have answered for my courage : but now , to be sure , there is nothing to alarm one . \u201d She looked round the room . The window curtains seemed in motion . It could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the divisions of the shutters ; and she stepped boldly forward , carelessly humming a tune , to assure herself of its being so , peeped courageously behind each curtain , saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her , and on placing a hand against the shutter , felt the strongest conviction of the wind \u2019s force . A glance at the old chest , as she turned away from this examination , was not without its use ; she scorned the causeless fears of an idle fancy , and began with a most happy indifference to prepare herself for bed . \u201c She should take her time ; she should not hurry herself ; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house . But she would not make up her fire ; _ that _ would seem cowardly , as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed . \u201d The fire therefore died away , and Catherine , having spent the best part of an hour in her arrangements , was beginning to think of stepping into bed , when , on giving a parting glance round the room , she was struck by the appearance of a high , old - fashioned black cabinet , which , though in a situation conspicuous enough , had never caught her notice before . Henry \u2019s words , his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first , immediately rushed across her ; and though there could be nothing really in it , there was something whimsical , it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence ! She took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet . It was not absolutely ebony and gold ; but it was japan , black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind ; and as she held her candle , the yellow had very much the effect of gold . The key was in the door , and she had a strange fancy to look into it ; not , however , with the smallest expectation of finding anything , but it was so very odd , after what Henry had said . In short , she could not sleep till she had examined it . So , placing the candle with great caution on a chair , she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn it ; but it resisted her utmost strength . Alarmed , but not discouraged , she tried it another way ; a bolt flew , and she believed herself successful ; but how strangely mysterious ! the door was still immovable . She paused a moment in breathless wonder . The wind roared down the chimney , the rain beat in torrents against the windows , and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation . To retire to bed , however , unsatisfied on such a point , would be vain , since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity . Again , therefore , she applied herself to the key , and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope \u2019s last effort , the door suddenly yielded to her hand : her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory , and having thrown open each folding door , the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock , though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual , a double range of small drawers appeared in view , with some larger drawers above and below them ; and in the centre , a small door , closed also with a lock and key , secured in all probability a cavity of importance . Catherine \u2019s heart beat quick , but her courage did not fail her . With a cheek flushed by hope , and an eye straining with curiosity , her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth . It was entirely empty . With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second , a third , a fourth ; each was equally empty . Not one was left unsearched , and in not one was anything found . Well read in the art of concealing a treasure , the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her , and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain . The place in the middle alone remained now unexplored ; and though she had \u201c never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet , and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far , it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it . \u201d It was some time however before she could unfasten the door , the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer ; but at length it did open ; and not vain , as hitherto , was her search ; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity , apparently for concealment , and her feelings at that moment were indescribable . Her heart fluttered , her knees trembled , and her cheeks grew pale . She seized , with an unsteady hand , the precious manuscript , for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters ; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold , resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest . The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm ; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction ; it had yet some hours to burn ; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion , she hastily snuffed it . Alas ! it was snuffed and extinguished in one . A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect . Catherine , for a few moments , was motionless with horror . It was done completely ; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath . Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room . A violent gust of wind , rising with sudden fury , added fresh horror to the moment . Catherine trembled from head to foot . In the pause which succeeded , a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear . Human nature could support no more . A cold sweat stood on her forehead , the manuscript fell from her hand , and groping her way to the bed , she jumped hastily in , and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes . To close her eyes in sleep that night , she felt must be entirely out of the question . With a curiosity so justly awakened , and feelings in every way so agitated , repose must be absolutely impossible . The storm too abroad so dreadful ! she had not been used to feel alarm from wind , but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence . The manuscript so wonderfully found , so wonderfully accomplishing the morning \u2019s prediction , how was it to be accounted for ? What could it contain ? To whom could it relate ? By what means could it have been so long concealed ? And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it ! till she had made herself mistress of its contents , however , she could have neither repose nor comfort ; and with the sun \u2019s first rays she was determined to peruse it . But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene . She shuddered , tossed about in her bed , and envied every quiet sleeper . The storm still raged , and various were the noises , more terrific even than the wind , which struck at intervals on her startled ear . The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion , and at another the lock of her door was agitated , as if by the attempt of somebody to enter . Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery , and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans . Hour after hour passed away , and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep .", "clusters":
