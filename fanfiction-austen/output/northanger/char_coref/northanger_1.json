{"document": "2 In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland \u2019s personal and mental endowments , when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks \u2019 residence in Bath , it may be stated , for the reader \u2019s more certain information , lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be , that her heart was affectionate ; her disposition cheerful and open , without conceit or affectation of any kind \u2014 her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl ; her person pleasing , and , when in good looks , pretty \u2014 and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is . When the hour of departure drew near , the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe . A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness , and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together ; and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet . Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm - house , must , at such a moment , relieve the fulness of her heart . Who would not think so ? But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets , that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness , and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations . Her cautions were confined to the following points . \u201c I beg , Catherine , you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat , when you come from the Rooms at night ; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend ; I will give you this little book on purpose . \u201d Sally , or rather Sarah ( for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can ? ) , must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister . It is remarkable , however , that she neither insisted on Catherine \u2019s writing by every post , nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance , nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce . Everything indeed relative to this important journey was done , on the part of the Morlands , with a degree of moderation and composure , which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life , than with the refined susceptibilities , the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite . Her father , instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker , or even putting an hundred pounds bank - bill into her hands , gave her only ten guineas , and promised her more when she wanted it . Under these unpromising auspices , the parting took place , and the journey began . It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety . Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them , nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero . Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear , on Mrs. Allen \u2019s side , of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn , and that fortunately proved to be groundless . They arrived at Bath . Catherine was all eager delight \u2014 her eyes were here , there , everywhere , as they approached its fine and striking environs , and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel . She was come to be happy , and she felt happy already . They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street . It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen , that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work , and how she will , probably , contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable \u2014 whether by her imprudence , vulgarity , or jealousy \u2014 whether by intercepting her letters , ruining her character , or turning her out of doors . Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females , whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them . She had neither beauty , genius , accomplishment , nor manner . The air of a gentlewoman , a great deal of quiet , inactive good temper , and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible , intelligent man like Mr. Allen . In one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public , being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be . Dress was her passion . She had a most harmless delight in being fine ; and our heroine \u2019s entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn , and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion . Catherine too made some purchases herself , and when all these matters were arranged , the important evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms . Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand , her clothes put on with care , and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do . With such encouragement , Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd . As for admiration , it was always very welcome when it came , but she did not depend on it . Mrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late . The season was full , the room crowded , and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could . As for Mr. Allen , he repaired directly to the card - room , and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves . With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e , Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by the door , as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow ; Catherine , however , kept close at her side , and linked her arm too firmly within her friend \u2019s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly . But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd ; it seemed rather to increase as they went on , whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door , they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience . But this was far from being the case , and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room , their situation was just the same ; they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies . Still they moved on \u2014 something better was yet in view ; and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench . Here there was something less of crowd than below ; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her , and of all the dangers of her late passage through them . It was a splendid sight , and she began , for the first time that evening , to feel herself at a ball : she longed to dance , but she had not an acquaintance in the room . Mrs. Allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly , every now and then , \u201c I wish you could dance , my dear \u2014 I wish you could get a partner . \u201d For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes ; but they were repeated so often , and proved so totally ineffectual , that Catherine grew tired at last , and would thank her no more . They were not long able , however , to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained . Everybody was shortly in motion for tea , and they must squeeze out like the rest . Catherine began to feel something of disappointment \u2014 she was tired of being continually pressed against by people , the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest , and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives ; and when at last arrived in the tea - room , she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join , no acquaintance to claim , no gentleman to assist them . They saw nothing of Mr. Allen ; and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation , were obliged to sit down at the end of a table , at which a large party were already placed , without having anything to do there , or anybody to speak to , except each other . Mrs. Allen congratulated herself , as soon as they were seated , on having preserved her gown from injury . \u201c It would have been very shocking to have it torn , \u201d said she , \u201c would not it ? It is such a delicate muslin . For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room , I assure you . \u201d \u201c How uncomfortable it is , \u201d whispered Catherine , \u201c not to have a single acquaintance here ! \u201d \u201c Yes , my dear , \u201d replied Mrs. Allen , with perfect serenity , \u201c it is very uncomfortable indeed . \u201d \u201c What shall we do ? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here \u2014 we seem forcing ourselves into their party . \u201d \u201c Aye , so we do . That is very disagreeable . I wish we had a large acquaintance here . \u201d \u201c I wish we had _ any;_\u2014it would be somebody to go to . \u201d \u201c Very true , my dear ; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly . The Skinners were here last year \u2014 I wish they were here now . \u201d \u201c Had not we better go away as it is ? Here are no tea - things for us , you see . \u201d \u201c No more there are , indeed . How very provoking ! but I think we had better sit still , for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd ! how is my head , my dear ? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it , I am afraid . \u201d \u201c No , indeed , it looks very nice . But , dear Mrs. Allen , are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people ? I think you _ must _ know somebody . \u201d \u201c I do n\u2019t , upon my word \u2014 I wish I did . I wish I had a large acquaintance here with all my heart , and then I should get you a partner . I should be so glad to have you dance . There goes a strange - looking woman ! what an odd gown she has got on ! how old - fashioned it is ! look at the back . \u201d After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours ; it was thankfully accepted , and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it , which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening , till they were discovered and joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over . \u201c Well , Miss Morland , \u201d said he , directly , \u201c I hope you have had an agreeable ball . \u201d \u201c Very agreeable indeed , \u201d she replied , vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn . \u201c I wish she had been able to dance , \u201d said his wife ; \u201c I wish we could have got a partner for her . I have been saying how glad I should be if the Skinners were here this winter instead of last ; or if the Parrys had come , as they talked of once , she might have danced with George Parry . I am so sorry she has not had a partner ! \u201d \u201c We shall do better another evening I hope , \u201d was Mr. Allen \u2019s consolation . The company began to disperse when the dancing was over \u2014 enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort ; and now was the time for a heroine , who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening , to be noticed and admired . Every five minutes , by removing some of the crowd , gave greater openings for her charms . She was now seen by many young men who had not been near her before . Not one , however , started with rapturous wonder on beholding her , no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room , nor was she once called a divinity by anybody . Yet Catherine was in very good looks , and had the company only seen her three years before , they would _ now _ have thought her exceedingly handsome . She _ was _ looked at , however , and with some admiration ; for , in her own hearing , two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl . Such words had their due effect ; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before \u2014 her humble vanity was contented \u2014 she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms , and went to her chair in good humour with everybody , and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention . 3 Every morning now brought its regular duties \u2014 shops were to be visited ; some new part of the town to be looked at ; and the Pump - room to be attended , where they paraded up and down for an hour , looking at everybody and speaking to no one . The wish of a numerous acquaintance in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen , and she repeated it after every fresh proof , which every morning brought , of her knowing nobody at all . They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms ; and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine . The master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman - like young man as a partner ; his name was Tilney . He seemed to be about four or five and twenty , was rather tall , had a pleasing countenance , a very intelligent and lively eye , and , if not quite handsome , was very near it . His address was good , and Catherine felt herself in high luck . There was little leisure for speaking while they danced ; but when they were seated at tea , she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being . He talked with fluency and spirit \u2014 and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested , though it was hardly understood by her . After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them , he suddenly addressed her with\u2014\u201cI have hitherto been very remiss , madam , in the proper attentions of a partner here ; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath ; whether you were ever here before ; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms , the theatre , and the concert ; and how you like the place altogether . I have been very negligent \u2014 but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars ? If you are I will begin directly . \u201d \u201c You need not give yourself that trouble , sir . \u201d \u201c No trouble , I assure you , madam . \u201d Then forming his features into a set smile , and affectedly softening his voice , he added , with a simpering air , \u201c Have you been long in Bath , madam ? \u201d \u201c About a week , sir , \u201d replied Catherine , trying not to laugh . \u201c Really ! \u201d with affected astonishment . \u201c Why should you be surprised , sir ? \u201d \u201c Why , indeed ! \u201d said he , in his natural tone . \u201c But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply , and surprise is more easily assumed , and not less reasonable than any other . Now let us go on . Were you never here before , madam ? \u201d \u201c Never , sir . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir , I was there last Monday . \u201d \u201c Have you been to the theatre ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir , I was at the play on Tuesday . \u201d \u201c To the concert ? \u201d \u201c Yes , sir , on Wednesday . \u201d \u201c And are you altogether pleased with Bath ? \u201d \u201c Yes \u2014 I like it very well . \u201d \u201c Now I must give one smirk , and then we may be rational again . \u201d Catherine turned away her head , not knowing whether she might venture to laugh . \u201c I see what you think of me , \u201d said he gravely\u2014\u201cI shall make but a poor figure in your journal to - morrow . \u201d \u201c My journal ! \u201d \u201c Yes , I know exactly what you will say : Friday , went to the Lower Rooms ; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings \u2014 plain black shoes \u2014 appeared to much advantage ; but was strangely harassed by a queer , half - witted man , who would make me dance with him , and distressed me by his nonsense . \u201d \u201c Indeed I shall say no such thing . \u201d \u201c Shall I tell you what you ought to say ? \u201d \u201c If you please . \u201d \u201c I danced with a very agreeable young man , introduced by Mr. King ; had a great deal of conversation with him \u2014 seems a most extraordinary genius \u2014 hope I may know more of him . _ That _ , madam , is what I _ wish _ you to say . \u201d \u201c But , perhaps , I keep no journal . \u201d \u201c Perhaps you are not sitting in this room , and I am not sitting by you . These are points in which a doubt is equally possible . Not keep a journal ! how are your absent cousins to understand the tenor of your life in Bath without one ? How are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be , unless noted down every evening in a journal ? How are your various dresses to be remembered , and the particular state of your complexion , and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities , without having constant recourse to a journal ? My dear madam , I am not so ignorant of young ladies \u2019 ways as you wish to believe me ; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated . Everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female . Nature may have done something , but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal . \u201d \u201c I have sometimes thought , \u201d said Catherine , doubtingly , \u201c whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen ! that is \u2014 I should not think the superiority was always on our side . \u201d \u201c As far as I have had opportunity of judging , it appears to me that the usual style of letter - writing among women is faultless , except in three particulars . \u201d \u201c And what are they ? \u201d \u201c A general deficiency of subject , a total inattention to stops , and a very frequent ignorance of grammar . \u201d \u201c Upon my word ! i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment . You do not think too highly of us in that way . \u201d \u201c I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men , than that they sing better duets , or draw better landscapes . In every power , of which taste is the foundation , excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes . \u201d They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen : \u201c My dear Catherine , \u201d said she , \u201c do take this pin out of my sleeve ; I am afraid it has torn a hole already ; I shall be quite sorry if it has , for this is a favourite gown , though it cost but nine shillings a yard . \u201d \u201c That is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , \u201d said Mr. Tilney , looking at the muslin . \u201c Do you understand muslins , sir ? \u201d \u201c Particularly well ; I always buy my own cravats , and am allowed to be an excellent judge ; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown . I bought one for her the other day , and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it . I gave but five shillings a yard for it , and a true Indian muslin . \u201d Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius . \u201c Men commonly take so little notice of those things , \u201d said she ; \u201c I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another . You must be a great comfort to your sister , sir . \u201d \u201c I hope I am , madam . \u201d \u201c And pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland \u2019s gown ? \u201d \u201c It is very pretty , madam , \u201d said he , gravely examining it ; \u201c but I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . \u201d \u201c How can you , \u201d said Catherine , laughing , \u201c be so \u2014 \u201d She had almost said \u201c strange . \u201d \u201c I am quite of your opinion , sir , \u201d replied Mrs. Allen ; \u201c and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . \u201d \u201c But then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak . Muslin can never be said to be wasted . I have heard my sister say so forty times , when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted , or careless in cutting it to pieces . \u201d \u201c Bath is a charming place , sir ; there are so many good shops here . We are sadly off in the country ; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury , but it is so far to go \u2014 eight miles is a long way ; Mr. Allen says it is nine , measured nine ; but I am sure it can not be more than eight ; and it is such a fag \u2014 I come back tired to death . Now , here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes . \u201d Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said ; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced . Catherine feared , as she listened to their discourse , that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others . \u201c What are you thinking of so earnestly ? \u201d said he , as they walked back to the ballroom ; \u201c not of your partner , I hope , for , by that shake of the head , your meditations are not satisfactory . \u201d Catherine coloured , and said , \u201c I was not thinking of anything . \u201d \u201c That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . \u201d \u201c Well then , I will not . \u201d \u201c Thank you ; for now we shall soon be acquainted , as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet , and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much . \u201d They danced again ; and , when the assembly closed , parted , on the lady \u2019s side at least , with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance . Whether she thought of him so much , while she drank her warm wine and water , and prepared herself for bed , as to dream of him when there , can not be ascertained ; but I hope it was no more than in a slight slumber , or a morning doze at most ; for if it be true , as a celebrated writer has maintained , that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman \u2019s love is declared,[1 ] it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her . How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen \u2019s head , but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied ; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was , and had been assured of Mr. Tilney \u2019s being a clergyman , and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire .
