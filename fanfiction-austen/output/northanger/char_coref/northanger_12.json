{"document": "24 The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments . It was Sunday , and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the General in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home ; and great as was Catherine \u2019s curiosity , her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner , either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o\u2019clock , or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp . The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney , which immediately fronted the family pew . By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained ; and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph , in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband , who must have been in some way or other her destroyer , affected her even to tears . That the General , having erected such a monument , should be able to face it , was not perhaps very strange , and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view , maintain so elevated an air , look so fearlessly around , nay , that he should even enter the church , seemed wonderful to Catherine . Not , however , that many instances of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced . She could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice , going on from crime to crime , murdering whomsoever they chose , without any feeling of humanity or remorse ; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career . The erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney \u2019s actual decease . Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber , were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed \u2014 what could it avail in such a case ? Catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced , and a supposititious funeral carried on . The succeeding morning promised something better . The General \u2019s early walk , ill - timed as it was in every other view , was favourable here ; and when she knew him to be out of the house , she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise . Eleanor was ready to oblige her ; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise , their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed - chamber . It represented a very lovely woman , with a mild and pensive countenance , justifying , so far , the expectations of its new observer ; but they were not in every respect answered , for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features , hair , complexion , that should be the very counterpart , the very image , if not of Henry \u2019s , of Eleanor\u2019s \u2014 the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking , bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child . A face once taken was taken for generations . But here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness . She contemplated it , however , in spite of this drawback , with much emotion , and , but for a yet stronger interest , would have left it unwillingly . Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse ; she could only look at her companion . Eleanor \u2019s countenance was dejected , yet sedate ; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing . Again she passed through the folding doors , again her hand was upon the important lock , and Catherine , hardly able to breathe , was turning to close the former with fearful caution , when the figure , the dreaded figure of the General himself at the further end of the gallery , stood before her ! the name of \u201c Eleanor \u201d at the same moment , in his loudest tone , resounded through the building , giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence , and to Catherine terror upon terror . An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him , yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye ; and when her friend , who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her , had joined and disappeared with him , she ran for safety to her own room , and , locking herself in , believed that she should never have courage to go down again . She remained there at least an hour , in the greatest agitation , deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend , and expecting a summons herself from the angry General to attend him in his own apartment . No summons , however , arrived ; and at last , on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey , she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors . The breakfast - room was gay with company ; and she was named to them by the General as the friend of his daughter , in a complimentary style , which so well concealed his resentful ire , as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present . And Eleanor , with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character , taking an early occasion of saying to her , \u201c My father only wanted me to answer a note , \u201d she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the General , or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so . Upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence , after the company left them , and nothing occurred to disturb it . In the course of this morning \u2019s reflections , she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone . It would be much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter . To involve her in the danger of a second detection , to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart , could not be the office of a friend . The General \u2019s utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter ; and , besides , she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion . It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions , from which the other had , in all likelihood , been hitherto happily exempt ; nor could she therefore , in _ her _ presence , search for those proofs of the General \u2019s cruelty , which however they might yet have escaped discovery , she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth , in the shape of some fragmented journal , continued to the last gasp . Of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress ; and as she wished to get it over before Henry \u2019s return , who was expected on the morrow , there was no time to be lost . The day was bright , her courage high ; at four o\u2019clock , the sun was now two hours above the horizon , and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual . It was done ; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike . It was no time for thought ; she hurried on , slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors , and without stopping to look or breathe , rushed forward to the one in question . The lock yielded to her hand , and , luckily , with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being . On tiptoe she entered ; the room was before her ; but it was some minutes before she could advance another step . She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature . She saw a large , well - proportioned apartment , an handsome dimity bed , arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid \u2019s care , a bright Bath stove , mahogany wardrobes , and neatly painted chairs , on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows ! Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked , and worked they were . Astonishment and doubt first seized them ; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame . She could not be mistaken as to the room ; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!\u2014in Miss Tilney \u2019s meaning , in her own calculation ! this apartment , to which she had given a date so ancient , a position so awful , proved to be one end of what the General \u2019s father had built . There were two other doors in the chamber , leading probably into dressing - closets ; but she had no inclination to open either . Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked , or the volume in which she had last read , remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper ? No : whatever might have been the General \u2019s crimes , he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection . She was sick of exploring , and desired but to be safe in her own room , with her own heart only privy to its folly ; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered , when the sound of footsteps , she could hardly tell where , made her pause and tremble . To be found there , even by a servant , would be unpleasant ; but by the General ( and he seemed always at hand when least wanted ) , much worse ! she listened \u2014 the sound had ceased ; and resolving not to lose a moment , she passed through and closed the door . At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened ; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs , by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery . She had no power to move . With a feeling of terror not very definable , she fixed her eyes on the staircase , and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view . \u201c Mr. Tilney ! \u201d she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment . He looked astonished too . \u201c Good God ! \u201d she continued , not attending to his address . \u201c How came you here ? How came you up that staircase ? \u201d \u201c How came I up that staircase ! \u201d he replied , greatly surprised . \u201c Because it is my nearest way from the stable - yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? \u201d Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford . She moved on towards the gallery . \u201c And may I not , in my turn , \u201d said he , as he pushed back the folding doors , \u201c ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . \u201d \u201c I have been , \u201d said Catherine , looking down , \u201c to see your mother \u2019s room . \u201d \u201c My mother \u2019s room ! is there anything extraordinary to be seen there ? \u201d \u201c No , nothing at all . I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . \u201d \u201c I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me . You look pale . I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs . Perhaps you did not know \u2014 you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use ? \u201d \u201c No , I was not . You have had a very fine day for your ride . \u201d \u201c Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? \u201d \u201c Oh no ! she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday \u2014 and we were coming here to these rooms \u2014 but only , \u201d dropping her voice , \u201c your father was with us . \u201d \u201c And that prevented you , \u201d said Henry , earnestly regarding her . \u201c Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage ? \u201d \u201c No , I only wanted to see \u2014 Is not it very late ? I must go and dress . \u201d \u201c It is only a quarter past four , \u201d showing his watch ; \u201c and you are not now in Bath . No theatre , no rooms to prepare for . Half an hour at Northanger must be enough . \u201d She could not contradict it , and therefore suffered herself to be detained , though her dread of further questions made her , for the first time in their acquaintance , wish to leave him . They walked slowly up the gallery . \u201c Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you ? \u201d \u201c No , and I am very much surprised . Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly . \u201d \u201c Promised so faithfully ! a faithful promise ! that puzzles me . I have heard of a faithful performance . But a faithful promise \u2014 the fidelity of promising ! it is a power little worth knowing , however , since it can deceive and pain you . My mother \u2019s room is very commodious , is it not ? Large and cheerful - looking , and the dressing - closets so well disposed ! It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house , and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own . She sent you to look at it , I suppose ? \u201d \u201c No . \u201d \u201c It has been your own doing entirely ? \u201d Catherine said nothing . After a short silence , during which he had closely observed her , he added , \u201c As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity , this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother \u2019s character , as described by Eleanor , which does honour to her memory . The world , I believe , never saw a better woman . But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this . The domestic , unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent , venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours . Eleanor , I suppose , has talked of her a great deal ? \u201d \u201c Yes , a great deal . That is \u2014 no , not much , but what she did say was very interesting . Her dying so suddenly \u201d ( slowly , and with hesitation it was spoken ) , \u201c and you \u2014 none of you being at home \u2014 and your father , I thought \u2014 perhaps had not been very fond of her . \u201d \u201c And from these circumstances , \u201d he replied ( his quick eye fixed on hers ) , \u201c you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence \u2014 some\u201d\u2014(involuntarily she shook her head)\u2014\u201cor it may be \u2014 of something still less pardonable . \u201d She raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before . \u201c My mother \u2019s illness , \u201d he continued , \u201c the seizure which ended in her death , _ was _ sudden . The malady itself , one from which she had often suffered , a bilious fever \u2014 its cause therefore constitutional . On the third day , in short , as soon as she could be prevailed on , a physician attended her , a very respectable man , and one in whom she had always placed great confidence . Upon his opinion of her danger , two others were called in the next day , and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours . On the fifth day she died . During the progress of her disorder , Frederick and I ( _ we _ were both at home ) saw her repeatedly ; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her , or which her situation in life could command . Poor Eleanor was absent , and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin . \u201d \u201c But your father , \u201d said Catherine , \u201c was _ he _ afflicted ? \u201d \u201c For a time , greatly so . You have erred in supposing him not attached to her . He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to \u2014 we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition \u2014 and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did . His value of her was sincere ; and , if not permanently , he was truly afflicted by her death . \u201d \u201c I am very glad of it , \u201d said Catherine ; \u201c it would have been very shocking ! \u201d \u201c If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to \u2014 Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained . What have you been judging from ? Remember the country and the age in which we live . Remember that we are English , that we are Christians . Consult your own understanding , your own sense of the probable , your own observation of what is passing around you . Does our education prepare us for such atrocities ? Do our laws connive at them ? Could they be perpetrated without being known , in a country like this , where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing , where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies , and where roads and newspapers lay everything open ? Dearest Miss Morland , what ideas have you been admitting ? \u201d They had reached the end of the gallery , and with tears of shame she ran off to her own room . 25 The visions of romance were over . Catherine was completely awakened . Henry \u2019s address , short as it had been , had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done . Most grievously was she humbled . Most bitterly did she cry . It was not only with herself that she was sunk \u2014 but with Henry . Her folly , which now seemed even criminal , was all exposed to him , and he must despise her forever . The liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father \u2014 could he ever forgive it ? The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears \u2014 could they ever be forgotten ? She hated herself more than she could express . He had \u2014 she thought he had , once or twice before this fatal morning , shown something like affection for her . But now \u2014 in short , she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour , went down when the clock struck five , with a broken heart , and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor \u2019s inquiry if she was well . The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room , and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual . Catherine had never wanted comfort more , and he looked as if he was aware of it . The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness ; and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity . She did not learn either to forget or defend the past ; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther , and that it might not cost her Henry \u2019s entire regard . Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done , nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary , self - created delusion , each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm , and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which , before she entered the abbey , had been craving to be frightened . She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of Northanger . She saw that the infatuation had been created , the mischief settled , long before her quitting Bath , and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged . Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe \u2019s works , and charming even as were the works of all her imitators , it was not in them perhaps that human nature , at least in the Midland counties of England , was to be looked for . Of the Alps and Pyrenees , with their pine forests and their vices , they might give a faithful delineation ; and Italy , Switzerland , and the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there represented . Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country , and even of that , if hard pressed , would have yielded the northern and western extremities . But in the central part of England there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved , in the laws of the land , and the manners of the age . Murder was not tolerated , servants were not slaves , and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured , like rhubarb , from every druggist . Among the Alps and Pyrenees , perhaps , there were no mixed characters . There , such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend . But in England it was not so ; among the English , she believed , in their hearts and habits , there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad . Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable . Her mind made up on these several points , and her resolution formed , of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense , she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever ; and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day . Henry \u2019s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct , in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed , was of the greatest assistance to her ; and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress , her spirits became absolutely comfortable , and capable , as heretofore , of continual improvement by anything he said . There were still some subjects , indeed , under which she believed they must always tremble \u2014 the mention of a chest or a cabinet , for instance \u2014 and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape : but even _ she _ could allow that an occasional memento of past folly , however painful , might not be without use . The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance . Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater . She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella \u2019s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James . Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella . James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton . But Isabella had promised and promised again ; and when she promised a thing , she was so scrupulous in performing it ! this made it so particularly strange ! For nine successive mornings , Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment , which each morning became more severe : but , on the tenth , when she entered the breakfast - room , her first object was a letter , held out by Henry \u2019s willing hand . She thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself . \u201c \u2019 Tis only from James , however , \u201d as she looked at the direction . She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : \u201c Dear Catherine , \u201c Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me . I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again . I shall not enter into particulars \u2014 they would only pain you more . You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God ! i am undeceived in time ! but it is a heavy blow ! after my father \u2019s consent had been so kindly given \u2014 but no more of this . She has made me miserable forever ! let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; _ your _ love I do build upon . I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced . Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much . I have written to him and my father . Her duplicity hurts me more than all ; till the very last , if I reasoned with her , she declared herself as much attached to me as ever , and laughed at my fears . I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it ; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved , I was that man . I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney . We parted at last by mutual consent \u2014 happy for me had we never met ! i can never expect to know such another woman ! Dearest Catherine , beware how you give your heart . \u201c Believe me , \u201d & c. Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began . He was prevented , however , from even looking his surprise by his father \u2019s entrance . They went to breakfast directly ; but Catherine could hardly eat anything . Tears filled her eyes , and even ran down her cheeks as she sat . The letter was one moment in her hand , then in her lap , and then in her pocket ; and she looked as if she knew not what she did . The General , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible . As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room ; but the housemaids were busy in it , and she was obliged to come down again . She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her . She drew back , trying to beg their pardon , but was , with gentle violence , forced to return ; and the others withdrew , after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her . After half an hour \u2019s free indulgence of grief and reflection , Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends ; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration . Perhaps , if particularly questioned , she might just give an idea \u2014 just distantly hint at it \u2014 but not more . To expose a friend , such a friend as Isabella had been to her \u2014 and then their own brother so closely concerned in it ! She believed she must waive the subject altogether . Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast - room ; and each , as she entered it , looked at her anxiously . Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , \u201c No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? Mr. and Mrs. Morland \u2014 your brothers and sisters \u2014 I hope they are none of them ill ? \u201d \u201c No , I thank you \u201d ( sighing as she spoke ) ; \u201c they are all very well . My letter was from my brother at Oxford . \u201d Nothing further was said for a few minutes ; and then speaking through her tears , she added , \u201c I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again ! \u201d \u201c I am sorry , \u201d said Henry , closing the book he had just opened ; \u201c if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . \u201d \u201c It contained something worse than anybody could suppose ! poor James is so unhappy ! you will soon know why . \u201d \u201c To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , \u201d replied Henry warmly , \u201c must be a comfort to him under any distress . \u201d \u201c I have one favour to beg , \u201d said Catherine , shortly afterwards , in an agitated manner , \u201c that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . \u201d \u201c Our brother ! frederick ! \u201d \u201c Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . \u201d Eleanor \u2019s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment ; but Henry began to suspect the truth , and something , in which Miss Thorpe \u2019s name was included , passed his lips . \u201c How quick you are ! \u201d cried Catherine : \u201c you have guessed it , I declare ! And yet , when we talked about it in Bath , you little thought of its ending so . Isabella \u2014 no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her \u2014 Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours ! could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? \u201d \u201c I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed . I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland \u2019s disappointment . His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable . I think you must be deceived so far . I am very sorry for Mr. Morland \u2014 sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy ; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick \u2019s marrying her than at any other part of the story . \u201d \u201c It is very true , however ; you shall read James \u2019s letter yourself . Stay \u2014 There is one part \u2014 \u201d recollecting with a blush the last line . \u201c Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? \u201d \u201c No , read it yourself , \u201d cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer . \u201c I do not know what I was thinking of \u201d ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; \u201c James only means to give me good advice . \u201d He gladly received the letter , and , having read it through , with close attention , returned it saying , \u201c Well , if it is to be so , I can only say that I am sorry for it . Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected . I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . \u201d Miss Tilney , at Catherine \u2019s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe \u2019s connections and fortune . \u201c Her mother is a very good sort of woman , \u201d was Catherine \u2019s answer . \u201c What was her father ? \u201d \u201c A lawyer , I believe . They live at Putney . \u201d \u201c Are they a wealthy family ? \u201d \u201c No , not very . I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family . Your father is so very liberal ! He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children . \u201d The brother and sister looked at each other . \u201c But , \u201d said Eleanor , after a short pause , \u201c would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ? She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so . And how strange an infatuation on Frederick \u2019s side ! a girl who , before his eyes , is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man ! is not it inconceivable , Henry ? Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly ! who found no woman good enough to be loved ! \u201d \u201c That is the most unpromising circumstance , the strongest presumption against him . When I think of his past declarations , I give him up . Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe \u2019s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured . It is all over with Frederick indeed ! he is a deceased man \u2014 defunct in understanding . Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . \u201d \u201c Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , \u201d said Eleanor with a smile . \u201c But perhaps , \u201d observed Catherine , \u201c though she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours . Now she has really got the man she likes , she may be constant . \u201d \u201c Indeed I am afraid she will , \u201d replied Henry ; \u201c I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick \u2019s only chance . I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . \u201d \u201c You think it is all for ambition , then ? And , upon my word , there are some things that seem very like it . I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more . I never was so deceived in anyone \u2019s character in my life before . \u201d \u201c Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . \u201d \u201c My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it . \u201d \u201c Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours . You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy . Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent . You would not , for instance , now go to a ball for the world . You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve , on whose regard you can place dependence , or whose counsel , in any difficulty , you could rely on . You feel all this ? \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said Catherine , after a few moments \u2019 reflection , \u201c I do not \u2014 ought I ? To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought . \u201d \u201c You feel , as you always do , what is most to the credit of human nature . Such feelings ought to be investigated , that they may know themselves . \u201d Catherine , by some chance or other , found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on , though so unaccountably , to mention the circumstance which had produced it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [48, 49], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [52, 53],
