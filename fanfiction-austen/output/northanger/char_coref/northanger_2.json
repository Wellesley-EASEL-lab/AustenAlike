{"document": "4 With more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump - room the next day , secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning were over , and ready to meet him with a smile ; but no smile was demanded \u2014 Mr. Tilney did not appear . Every creature in Bath , except himself , was to be seen in the room at different periods of the fashionable hours ; crowds of people were every moment passing in and out , up the steps and down ; people whom nobody cared about , and nobody wanted to see ; and he only was absent . \u201c What a delightful place Bath is , \u201d said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock , after parading the room till they were tired ; \u201c and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here . \u201d This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now ; but we are told to \u201c despair of nothing we would attain , \u201d as \u201c unwearied diligence our point would gain \u201d ; and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward , for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age , who was sitting by her , and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes , addressed her with great complaisance in these words : \u201c I think , madam , I can not be mistaken ; it is a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing you , but is not your name Allen ? \u201d This question answered , as it readily was , the stranger pronounced hers to be Thorpe ; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate , whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages , and that many years ago . Their joy on this meeting was very great , as well it might , since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years . Compliments on good looks now passed ; and , after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together , how little they had thought of meeting in Bath , and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend , they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families , sisters , and cousins , talking both together , far more ready to give than to receive information , and each hearing very little of what the other said . Mrs. Thorpe , however , had one great advantage as a talker , over Mrs. Allen , in a family of children ; and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons , and the beauty of her daughters , when she related their different situations and views \u2014 that John was at Oxford , Edward at Merchant Taylors \u2019 , and William at sea \u2014 and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were , Mrs. Allen had no similar information to give , no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend , and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions , consoling herself , however , with the discovery , which her keen eyes soon made , that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe \u2019s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own . \u201c Here come my dear girls , \u201d cried Mrs. Thorpe , pointing at three smart - looking females who , arm in arm , were then moving towards her . \u201c My dear Mrs. Allen , I long to introduce them ; they will be so delighted to see you : the tallest is Isabella , my eldest ; is not she a fine young woman ? The others are very much admired too , but I believe Isabella is the handsomest . \u201d The Miss Thorpes were introduced ; and Miss Morland , who had been for a short time forgotten , was introduced likewise . The name seemed to strike them all ; and , after speaking to her with great civility , the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest , \u201c How excessively like her brother Miss Morland is ! \u201d \u201c The very picture of him indeed ! \u201d cried the mother \u2014 and \u201c I should have known her anywhere for his sister ! \u201d was repeated by them all , two or three times over . For a moment Catherine was surprised ; but Mrs. Thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with Mr. James Morland , before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college , of the name of Thorpe ; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmas vacation with his family , near London . The whole being explained , many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her ; of being considered as already friends , through the friendship of their brothers , etc . , which Catherine heard with pleasure , and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command ; and , as the first proof of amity , she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe , and take a turn with her about the room . Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance , and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe . Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love . Their conversation turned upon those subjects , of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies : such as dress , balls , flirtations , and quizzes . Miss Thorpe , however , being four years older than Miss Morland , and at least four years better informed , had a very decided advantage in discussing such points ; she could compare the balls of Bath with those of Tunbridge , its fashions with the fashions of London ; could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire ; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other ; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd . These powers received due admiration from Catherine , to whom they were entirely new ; and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity , had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe \u2019s manners , and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her , softened down every feeling of awe , and left nothing but tender affection . Their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump - room , but required , when they all quitted it together , that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen \u2019s house ; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands , after learning , to their mutual relief , that they should see each other across the theatre at night , and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning . Catherine then ran directly upstairs , and watched Miss Thorpe \u2019s progress down the street from the drawing - room window ; admired the graceful spirit of her walk , the fashionable air of her figure and dress ; and felt grateful , as well she might , for the chance which had procured her such a friend . Mrs. Thorpe was a widow , and not a very rich one ; she was a good - humoured , well - meaning woman , and a very indulgent mother . Her eldest daughter had great personal beauty , and the younger ones , by pretending to be as handsome as their sister , imitating her air , and dressing in the same style , did very well . This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself , of her past adventures and sufferings , which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters ; in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth , and conversations , which had passed twenty years before , be minutely repeated . 5 Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening , in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe , though they certainly claimed much of her leisure , as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach ; but she looked in vain . Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump - room . She hoped to be more fortunate the next day ; and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning , she hardly felt a doubt of it ; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants , and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is . As soon as divine service was over , the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other ; and after staying long enough in the pump - room to discover that the crowd was insupportable , and that there was not a genteel face to be seen , which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season , they hastened away to the Crescent , to breathe the fresh air of better company . Here Catherine and Isabella , arm in arm , again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation ; they talked much , and with much enjoyment ; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner . He was nowhere to be met with ; every search for him was equally unsuccessful , in morning lounges or evening assemblies ; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms , at dressed or undressed balls , was he perceivable ; nor among the walkers , the horsemen , or the curricle - drivers of the morning . His name was not in the pump - room book , and curiosity could do no more . He must be gone from Bath . Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short ! this sort of mysteriousness , which is always so becoming in a hero , threw a fresh grace in Catherine \u2019s imagination around his person and manners , and increased her anxiety to know more of him . From the Thorpes she could learn nothing , for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen . It was a subject , however , in which she often indulged with her fair friend , from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him ; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken . Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man , and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine , and would therefore shortly return . She liked him the better for being a clergyman , \u201c for she must confess herself very partial to the profession \u201d ; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it . Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion \u2014 but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love , or the duties of friendship , to know when delicate raillery was properly called for , or when a confidence should be forced . Mrs. Allen was now quite happy \u2014 quite satisfied with Bath . She had found some acquaintance , had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend ; and , as the completion of good fortune , had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself . Her daily expressions were no longer , \u201c I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath ! \u201d They were changed into , \u201c How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! \u201d and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families , as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be ; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe , in what they called conversation , but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion , and not often any resemblance of subject , for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children , and Mrs. Allen of her gowns . The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm , and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves . They called each other by their Christian name , were always arm in arm when they walked , pinned up each other \u2019s train for the dance , and were not to be divided in the set ; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments , they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt , and shut themselves up , to read novels together . Yes , novels ; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel - writers , of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances , to the number of which they are themselves adding \u2014 joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works , and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine , who , if she accidentally take up a novel , is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust . Alas ! if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another , from whom can she expect protection and regard ? I can not approve of it . Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure , and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans . Let us not desert one another ; we are an injured body . Although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world , no species of composition has been so much decried . From pride , ignorance , or fashion , our foes are almost as many as our readers . And while the abilities of the nine - hundredth abridger of the History of England , or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton , Pope , and Prior , with a paper from the Spectator , and a chapter from Sterne , are eulogized by a thousand pens \u2014 there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist , and of slighting the performances which have only genius , wit , and taste to recommend them . \u201c I am no novel - reader \u2014 I seldom look into novels \u2014 Do not imagine that _ I _ often read novels \u2014 It is really very well for a novel . \u201d Such is the common ca nt . \u201c And what are you reading , Miss \u2014 \u2014 ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! it is only a novel ! \u201d replies the young lady , while she lays down her book with affected indifference , or momentary shame . \u201c It is only Cecilia , or Camilla , or Belinda \u201d ; or , in short , only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed , in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature , the happiest delineation of its varieties , the liveliest effusions of wit and humour , are conveyed to the world in the best - chosen language . Now , had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the Spectator , instead of such a work , how proudly would she have produced the book , and told its name ; though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication , of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste : the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances , unnatural characters , and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living ; and their language , too , frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [7, 8], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [20, 21], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [823, 824],
