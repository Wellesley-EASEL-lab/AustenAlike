{"document": "18 With a mind thus full of happiness , Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away , without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together . She began first to be sensible of this , and to sigh for her conversation , as she walked along the pump - room one morning , by Mrs. Allen \u2019s side , without anything to say or to hear ; and scarcely had she felt a five minutes \u2019 longing of friendship , before the object of it appeared , and inviting her to a secret conference , led the way to a seat . \u201c This is my favourite place , \u201d said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors , which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either ; \u201c it is so out of the way . \u201d Catherine , observing that Isabella \u2019s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other , as in eager expectation , and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch , thought the present a fine opportunity for being really so ; and therefore gaily said , \u201c Do not be uneasy , Isabella , James will soon be here . \u201d \u201c Psha ! my dear creature , \u201d she replied , \u201c do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow . It would be hideous to be always together ; we should be the jest of the place . And so you are going to Northanger ! i am amazingly glad of it . It is one of the finest old places in England , I understand . I shall depend upon a most particular description of it . \u201d \u201c You shall certainly have the best in my power to give . But who are you looking for ? Are your sisters coming ? \u201d \u201c I am not looking for anybody . One \u2019s eyes must be somewhere , and you know what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine , when my thoughts are an hundred miles off . I am amazingly absent ; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world . Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp . \u201d \u201c But I thought , Isabella , you had something in particular to tell me ? \u201d \u201c Oh yes , and so I have . But here is a proof of what I was saying . My poor head , I had quite forgot it . Well , the thing is this : I have just had a letter from John ; you can guess the contents . \u201d \u201c No , indeed , I can not . \u201d \u201c My sweet love , do not be so abominably affected . What can he write about , but yourself ? You know he is over head and ears in love with you . \u201d \u201c With _ me _ , dear Isabella ! \u201d \u201c Nay , my sweetest Catherine , this is being quite absurd ! modesty , and all that , is very well in its way , but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming . I have no idea of being so overstrained ! it is fishing for compliments . His attentions were such as a child must have noticed . And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement . He says so in this letter , says that he as good as made you an offer , and that you received his advances in the kindest way ; and now he wants me to urge his suit , and say all manner of pretty things to you . So it is in vain to affect ignorance . \u201d Catherine , with all the earnestness of truth , expressed her astonishment at such a charge , protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe \u2019s being in love with her , and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him . \u201c As to any attentions on his side , I do declare , upon my honour , I never was sensible of them for a moment \u2014 except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming . And as to making me an offer , or anything like it , there must be some unaccountable mistake . I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind , you know ! and , as I ever wish to be believed , I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us . The last half hour before he went away ! it must be all and completely a mistake \u2014 for I did not see him once that whole morning . \u201d \u201c But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar \u2019s Buildings \u2014 it was the day your father \u2019s consent came \u2014 and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . \u201d \u201c Are you ? Well , if you say it , it was so , I dare say \u2014 but for the life of me , I can not recollect it . I _ do _ remember now being with you , and seeing him as well as the rest \u2014 but that we were ever alone for five minutes \u2014 However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him . I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me \u2014 but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side ; I never had the smallest idea of it . Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon \u2014 that is \u2014 I do not know what I ought to say \u2014 but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way . I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours , Isabella , I am sure ; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another\u2014_he _ is not the person . \u201d Isabella was silent . \u201c My dear friend , you must not be angry with me . I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me . And , you know , we shall still be sisters . \u201d \u201c Yes , yes \u201d ( with a blush ) , \u201c there are more ways than one of our being sisters . But where am I wandering to ? Well , my dear Catherine , the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John \u2014 is not it so ? \u201d \u201c I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . \u201d \u201c Since that is the case , I am sure I shall not tease you any further . John desired me to speak to you on the subject , and therefore I have . But I confess , as soon as I read his letter , I thought it a very foolish , imprudent business , and not likely to promote the good of either ; for what were you to live upon , supposing you came together ? You have both of you something , to be sure , but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays ; and after all that romancers may say , there is no doing without money . I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . \u201d \u201c You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?\u2014You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? \u201d \u201c Oh ! as to that , \u201d answered Isabella laughingly , \u201c I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been . All that is best known to yourself . A little harmless flirtation or so will occur , and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by . But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely . All those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits . What one means one day , you know , one may not mean the next . Circumstances change , opinions alter . \u201d \u201c But my opinion of your brother never did alter ; it was always the same . You are describing what never happened . \u201d \u201c My dearest Catherine , \u201d continued the other without at all listening to her , \u201c I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about . I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother , because he is my brother , and who perhaps after all , you know , might be just as happy without you , for people seldom know what they would be at , young men especially , they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant . What I say is , why should a brother \u2019s happiness be dearer to me than a friend \u2019s ? You know I carry my notions of friendship pretty high . But , above all things , my dear Catherine , do not be in a hurry . Take my word for it , that if you are in too great a hurry , you will certainly live to repent it . Tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections , and I believe he is very right . Ah ! here he comes ; never mind , he will not see us , I am sure . \u201d Catherine , looking up , perceived Captain Tilney ; and Isabella , earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke , soon caught his notice . He approached immediately , and took the seat to which her movements invited him . His first address made Catherine start . Though spoken low , she could distinguish , \u201c What ! always to be watched , in person or by proxy ! \u201d \u201c Psha , nonsense ! \u201d was Isabella \u2019s answer in the same half whisper . \u201c Why do you put such things into my head ? If I could believe it \u2014 my spirit , you know , is pretty independent . \u201d \u201c I wish your heart were independent . That would be enough for me . \u201d \u201c My heart , indeed ! what can you have to do with hearts ? You men have none of you any hearts . \u201d \u201c If we have not hearts , we have eyes ; and they give us torment enough . \u201d \u201c Do they ? I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me . I will look another way . I hope this pleases you \u201d ( turning her back on him ) ; \u201c I hope your eyes are not tormented now . \u201d \u201c Never more so ; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view \u2014 at once too much and too little . \u201d Catherine heard all this , and quite out of countenance , could listen no longer . Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking . But for this Isabella showed no inclination . She was so amazingly tired , and it was so odious to parade about the pump - room ; and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters ; she was expecting her sisters every moment ; so that her dearest Catherine must excuse her , and must sit quietly down again . But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney . With much uneasiness did she thus leave them . It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella \u2019s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement . To doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible ; and yet , during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd . She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self , and not so much about money , and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney . How strange that she should not perceive his admiration ! catherine longed to give her a hint of it , to put her on her guard , and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother . The compliment of John Thorpe \u2019s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister . She was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere ; for she had not forgotten that he could mistake , and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious . In vanity , therefore , she gained but little ; her chief profit was in wonder . That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment . Isabella talked of his attentions ; _ she _ had never been sensible of any ; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste , and would never be said again ; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort . 19 A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely . The result of her observations was not agreeable . Isabella seemed an altered creature . When she saw her , indeed , surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar \u2019s Buildings or Pulteney Street , her change of manners was so trifling that , had it gone no farther , it might have passed unnoticed . A something of languid indifference , or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before , would occasionally come across her ; but had nothing worse appeared , _ that _ might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest . But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney \u2019s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over . What could be meant by such unsteady conduct , what her friend could be at , was beyond her comprehension . Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting ; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent . James was the sufferer . She saw him grave and uneasy ; and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart , to _ her _ it was always an object . For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned . Though his looks did not please her , his name was a passport to her goodwill , and she thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment ; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella \u2019s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it . He might be jealous of her brother as a rival , but if more had seemed implied , the fault must have been in her misapprehension . She wished , by a gentle remonstrance , to remind Isabella of her situation , and make her aware of this double unkindness ; but for remonstrance , either opportunity or comprehension was always against her . If able to suggest a hint , Isabella could never understand it . In this distress , the intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation ; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days , and Captain Tilney \u2019s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own . But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing ; he was not to be of the party to Northanger ; he was to continue at Bath . When Catherine knew this , her resolution was directly made . She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother \u2019s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement . \u201c My brother does know it , \u201d was Henry \u2019s answer . \u201c Does he ? Then why does he stay here ? \u201d He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , \u201c Why do not you persuade him to go away ? The longer he stays , the worse it will be for him at last . Pray advise him for his own sake , and for everybody \u2019s sake , to leave Bath directly . Absence will in time make him comfortable again ; but he can have no hope here , and it is only staying to be miserable . \u201d Henry smiled and said , \u201c I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . \u201d \u201c Then you will persuade him to go away ? \u201d \u201c Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him . I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged . He knows what he is about , and must be his own master . \u201d \u201c No , he does not know what he is about , \u201d cried Catherine ; \u201c he does not know the pain he is giving my brother . Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . \u201d \u201c And are you sure it is my brother \u2019s doing ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very sure . \u201d \u201c Is it my brother \u2019s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe \u2019s admission of them , that gives the pain ? \u201d \u201c Is not it the same thing ? \u201d \u201c I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference . No man is offended by another man \u2019s admiration of the woman he loves ; it is the woman only who can make it a torment . \u201d Catherine blushed for her friend , and said , \u201c Isabella is wrong . But I am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother . She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father \u2019s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever . You know she must be attached to him . \u201d \u201c I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . \u201d \u201c Oh no , not flirts . A woman in love with one man can not flirt with another . \u201d \u201c It is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly . The gentlemen must each give up a little . \u201d After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , \u201c Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? \u201d \u201c I can have no opinion on that subject . \u201d \u201c But what can your brother mean ? If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? \u201d \u201c You are a very close questioner . \u201d \u201c Am I ? I only ask what I want to be told . \u201d \u201c But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother \u2019s heart . \u201d \u201c My brother \u2019s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . \u201d \u201c Well ? \u201d \u201c Well ! nay , if it is to be guesswork , let us all guess for ourselves . To be guided by second - hand conjecture is pitiful . The premises are before you . My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week \u2019s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . \u201d \u201c Well , \u201d said Catherine , after some moments \u2019 consideration , \u201c _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother \u2019s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not . But is not your father uncomfortable about it ? Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ? Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go . \u201d \u201c My dear Miss Morland , \u201d said Henry , \u201c in this amiable solicitude for your brother \u2019s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? Are you not carried a little too far ? Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe \u2019s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ? Is he safe only in solitude ? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ? He can not think this \u2014 and you may be sure that he would not have you think it . I will not say , \u2018 Do not be uneasy , \u2019 because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can . You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend ; depend upon it , therefore , that real jealousy never can exist between them ; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration . Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . \u201d Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , \u201c Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us . His leave of absence will soon expire , and he must return to his regiment . And what will then be their acquaintance ? The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney \u2019s passion for a month . \u201d Catherine would contend no longer against comfort . She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech , but it now carried her captive . Henry Tilney must know best . She blamed herself for the extent of her fears , and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again . Her resolution was supported by Isabella \u2019s behaviour in their parting interview . The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine \u2019s stay in Pulteney Street , and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness , or make her quit them in apprehension . James was in excellent spirits , and Isabella most engagingly placid . Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart ; but that at such a moment was allowable ; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction , and once she drew back her hand ; but Catherine remembered Henry \u2019s instructions , and placed it all to judicious affection . The embraces , tears , and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 10], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [23, 24], "text": "her"},
