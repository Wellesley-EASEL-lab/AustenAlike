{"document": "22 The housemaid \u2019s folding back her window - shutters at eight o\u2019clock the next day was the sound which first roused Catherine ; and she opened her eyes , wondering that they could ever have been closed , on objects of cheerfulness ; her fire was already burning , and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night . Instantaneously , with the consciousness of existence , returned her recollection of the manuscript ; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid \u2019s going away , she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground , and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow . She now plainly saw that she must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had shuddered over in books , for the roll , seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets , was altogether but of trifling size , and much less than she had supposed it to be at first . Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page . She started at its import . Could it be possible , or did not her senses play her false ? An inventory of linen , in coarse and modern characters , seemed all that was before her ! if the evidence of sight might be trusted , she held a washing - bill in her hand . She seized another sheet , and saw the same articles with little variation ; a third , a fourth , and a fifth presented nothing new . Shirts , stockings , cravats , and waistcoats faced her in each . Two others , penned by the same hand , marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting , in letters , hair - powder , shoe - string , and breeches - ball . And the larger sheet , which had enclosed the rest , seemed by its first cramp line , \u201c To poultice chestnut mare\u201d\u2014a farrier \u2019s bill ! such was the collection of papers ( left perhaps , as she could then suppose , by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them ) which had filled her with expectation and alarm , and robbed her of half her night \u2019s rest ! she felt humbled to the dust . Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom ? A corner of it , catching her eye as she lay , seemed to rise up in judgment against her . Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies . To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that , so modern , so habitable!\u2014Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet , the key of which was open to all ! How could she have so imposed on herself ? Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly ! and it was in a great measure his own doing , for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures , she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it . This was the only comfort that occurred . Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly , those detestable papers then scattered over the bed , she rose directly , and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before , returned them to the same spot within the cabinet , with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again , to disgrace her even with herself . Why the locks should have been so difficult to open , however , was still something remarkable , for she could now manage them with perfect ease . In this there was surely something mysterious , and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute , till the possibility of the door \u2019s having been at first unlocked , and of being herself its fastener , darted into her head , and cost her another blush . She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections , and found her way with all speed to the breakfast - parlour , as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before . Henry was alone in it ; and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest , with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited , was rather distressing . For the world would she not have her weakness suspected , and yet , unequal to an absolute falsehood , was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little . \u201c But we have a charming morning after it , \u201d she added , desiring to get rid of the subject ; \u201c and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over . What beautiful hyacinths ! i have just learnt to love a hyacinth . \u201d \u201c And how might you learn ? By accident or argument ? \u201d \u201c Your sister taught me ; I can not tell how . Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . \u201d \u201c But now you love a hyacinth . So much the better . You have gained a new source of enjoyment , and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible . Besides , a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex , as a means of getting you out of doors , and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take . And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic , who can tell , the sentiment once raised , but you may in time come to love a rose ? \u201d \u201c But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors . The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me , and in fine weather I am out more than half my time . Mamma says I am never within . \u201d \u201c At any rate , however , I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth . The mere habit of learning to love is the thing ; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing . Has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction ? \u201d Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the General , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind , but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure . The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine \u2019s notice when they were seated at table ; and , luckily , it had been the General \u2019s choice . He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste , confessed it to be neat and simple , thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country ; and for his part , to his uncritical palate , the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire , as from that of Dresden or S\u00eave . But this was quite an old set , purchased two years ago . The manufacture was much improved since that time ; he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town , and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind , might have been tempted to order a new set . He trusted , however , that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one \u2014 though not for himself . Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him . Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston , where business required and would keep him two or three days . They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse , and immediately on re - entering the breakfast - room , Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure . \u201c This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother \u2019s fortitude , \u201d observed the General to Eleanor . \u201c Woodston will make but a sombre appearance to - day . \u201d \u201c Is it a pretty place ? \u201d asked Catherine . \u201c What say you , Eleanor ? Speak your opinion , for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men . I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations . The house stands among fine meadows facing the south - east , with an excellent kitchen - garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son . It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one . Did Henry \u2019s income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill - provided for . Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business . But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment . The money is nothing , it is not an object , but employment is the thing . Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession . \u201d The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes . The silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable . Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house , and he now offered himself as her conductor ; and though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter , it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself , under any circumstances , not to be gladly accepted ; for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey , and had seen only a few of its rooms . The netting - box , just leisurely drawn forth , was closed with joyful haste , and she was ready to attend him in a moment . \u201c And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . \u201d She curtsied her acquiescence . \u201c But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object . The weather was at present favourable , and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so . Which would she prefer ? He was equally at her service . Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend \u2019s wishes ? But he thought he could discern . Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland \u2019s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather . But when did she judge amiss ? The abbey would be always safe and dry . He yielded implicitly , and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment . \u201d He left the room , and Catherine , with a disappointed , anxious face , began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination , under a mistaken idea of pleasing her ; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney \u2019s saying , with a little confusion , \u201c I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father \u2019s account ; he always walks out at this time of day . \u201d Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood . Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed ? Could there be any unwillingness on the General \u2019s side to show her over the abbey ? The proposal was his own . And was not it odd that he should _ always _ take his walk so early ? Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so . It was certainly very provoking . She was all impatience to see the house , and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds . If Henry had been with them indeed ! But now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it . Such were her thoughts , but she kept them to herself , and put on her bonnet in patient discontent . She was struck , however , beyond her expectation , by the grandeur of the abbey , as she saw it for the first time from the lawn . The whole building enclosed a large court ; and two sides of the quadrangle , rich in Gothic ornaments , stood forward for admiration . The remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees , or luxuriant plantations , and the steep woody hills rising behind , to give it shelter , were beautiful even in the leafless month of March . Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it ; and her feelings of delight were so strong , that without waiting for any better authority , she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise . The General listened with assenting gratitude ; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour . The kitchen - garden was to be next admired , and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park . The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay , being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen \u2019s , as well as her father \u2019s , including church - yard and orchard . The walls seemed countless in number , endless in length ; a village of hot - houses seemed to arise among them , and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure . The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , \u201c without any ambition of that sort himself \u2014 without any solicitude about it \u2014 he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom . If he had a hobby - horse , it was _ that _ . He loved a garden . Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit \u2014 or if he did not , his friends and children did . There were great vexations , however , attending such a garden as his . The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits . The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year . Mr. Allen , he supposed , must feel these inconveniences as well as himself . \u201d \u201c No , not at all . Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . \u201d With a triumphant smile of self - satisfaction , the General wished he could do the same , for he never entered his , without being vexed in some way or other , by its falling short of his plan . \u201c How were Mr. Allen \u2019s succession - houses worked ? \u201d describing the nature of his own as they entered them . \u201c Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then . \u201d \u201c He is a happy man ! \u201d said the General , with a look of very happy contempt . Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired . \u201c But where are you going , Eleanor ? Why do you choose that cold , damp path to it ? Miss Morland will get wet . Our best way is across the park . \u201d \u201c This is so favourite a walk of mine , \u201d said Miss Tilney , \u201c that I always think it the best and nearest way . But perhaps it may be damp . \u201d It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the General \u2019s disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward . He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition . He excused himself , however , from attending them : \u201c The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . \u201d He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . \u201c I am particularly fond of this spot , \u201d said her companion , with a sigh . \u201c It was my mother \u2019s favourite walk . \u201d Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before , and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance , and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more . \u201c I used to walk here so often with her ! \u201d added Eleanor ; \u201c though I never loved it then , as I have loved it since . At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice . But her memory endears it now . \u201d \u201c And ought it not , \u201d reflected Catherine , \u201c to endear it to her husband ? Yet the General would not enter it . \u201d Miss Tilney continuing silent , she ventured to say , \u201c Her death must have been a great affliction ! \u201d \u201c A great and increasing one , \u201d replied the other , in a low voice . \u201c I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . \u201d She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , \u201c I have no sister , you know \u2014 and though Henry \u2014 though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . \u201d \u201c To be sure you must miss him very much . \u201d \u201c A mother would have been always present . A mother would have been a constant friend ; her influence would have been beyond all other . \u201d \u201c Was she a very charming woman ? Was she handsome ? Was there any picture of her in the abbey ? And why had she been so partial to that grove ? Was it from dejection of spirits?\u201d\u2014were questions now eagerly poured forth ; the first three received a ready affirmative , the two others were passed by ; and Catherine \u2019s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question , whether answered or not . Of her unhappiness in marriage , she felt persuaded . The General certainly had been an unkind husband . He did not love her walk : could he therefore have loved her ? And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . \u201c Her picture , I suppose , \u201d blushing at the consummate art of her own question , \u201c hangs in your father \u2019s room ? \u201d \u201c No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place . Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber \u2014 where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . \u201d Here was another proof . A portrait \u2014 very like \u2014 of a departed wife , not valued by the husband ! he must have been dreadfully cruel to her ! Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which , in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited ; and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion . Yes , aversion ! his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her . She had often read of such characters , characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn ; but here was proof positive of the contrary . She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the General ; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation , she found herself again obliged to walk with him , listen to him , and even to smile when he smiled . Being no longer able , however , to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects , she soon began to walk with lassitude ; the General perceived it , and with a concern for her health , which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him , was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house . He would follow them in a quarter of an hour . Again they parted \u2014 but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return . This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [1, 3], "text": "The housemaid"}, {"position":
