{"document": "14 The next morning was fair , and Catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled party . With Mr. Allen to support her , she felt no dread of the event : but she would gladly be spared a contest , where victory itself was painful , and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them . The Tilneys called for her at the appointed time ; and no new difficulty arising , no sudden recollection , no unexpected summons , no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their measures , my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement , though it was made with the hero himself . They determined on walking round Beechen Cliff , that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object from almost every opening in Bath . \u201c I never look at it , \u201d said Catherine , as they walked along the side of the river , \u201c without thinking of the south of France . \u201d \u201c You have been abroad then ? \u201d said Henry , a little surprised . \u201c Oh ! no , I only mean what I have read about . It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her father travelled through , in The Mysteries of Udolpho . But you never read novels , I dare say ? \u201d \u201c Why not ? \u201d \u201c Because they are not clever enough for you \u2014 gentlemen read better books . \u201d \u201c The person , be it gentleman or lady , who has not pleasure in a good novel , must be intolerably stupid . I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe \u2019s works , and most of them with great pleasure . The Mysteries of Udolpho , when I had once begun it , I could not lay down again ; I remember finishing it in two days \u2014 my hair standing on end the whole time . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d added Miss Tilney , \u201c and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me , and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note , instead of waiting for me , you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk , and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it . \u201d \u201c Thank you , Eleanor \u2014 a most honourable testimony . You see , Miss Morland , the injustice of your suspicions . Here was I , in my eagerness to get on , refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister , breaking the promise I had made of reading it aloud , and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part , by running away with the volume , which , you are to observe , was her own , particularly her own . I am proud when I reflect on it , and I think it must establish me in your good opinion . \u201d \u201c I am very glad to hear it indeed , and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself . But I really thought before , young men despised novels amazingly . \u201d \u201c It is _ amazingly ; _ it may well suggest _ amazement _ if they do \u2014 for they read nearly as many as women . I myself have read hundreds and hundreds . Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and Louisas . If we proceed to particulars , and engage in the never - ceasing inquiry of \u2018 Have you read this ? \u2019 and \u2018 Have you read that ? \u2019 I shall soon leave you as far behind me as \u2014 what shall I say?\u2014I want an appropriate simile.\u2014as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into Italy . Consider how many years I have had the start of you . I had entered on my studies at Oxford , while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home ! \u201d \u201c Not very good , I am afraid . But now really , do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world ? \u201d \u201c The nicest \u2014 by which I suppose you mean the neatest . That must depend upon the binding . \u201d \u201c Henry , \u201d said Miss Tilney , \u201c you are very impertinent . Miss Morland , he is treating you exactly as he does his sister . He is forever finding fault with me , for some incorrectness of language , and now he is taking the same liberty with you . The word \u2018 nicest , \u2019 as you used it , did not suit him ; and you had better change it as soon as you can , or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way . \u201d \u201c I am sure , \u201d cried Catherine , \u201c I did not mean to say anything wrong ; but it _ is _ a nice book , and why should not I call it so ? \u201d \u201c Very true , \u201d said Henry , \u201c and this is a very nice day , and we are taking a very nice walk , and you are two very nice young ladies . Oh ! it is a very nice word indeed ! it does for everything . Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness , propriety , delicacy , or refinement \u2014 people were nice in their dress , in their sentiments , or their choice . But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word . \u201d \u201c While , in fact , \u201d cried his sister , \u201c it ought only to be applied to you , without any commendation at all . You are more nice than wise . Come , Miss Morland , let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction , while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we like best . It is a most interesting work . You are fond of that kind of reading ? \u201d \u201c To say the truth , I do not much like any other . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! \u201d \u201c That is , I can read poetry and plays , and things of that sort , and do not dislike travels . But history , real solemn history , I can not be interested in . Can you ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I am fond of history . \u201d \u201c I wish I were too . I read it a little as a duty , but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me . The quarrels of popes and kings , with wars or pestilences , in every page ; the men all so good for nothing , and hardly any women at all \u2014 it is very tiresome : and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull , for a great deal of it must be invention . The speeches that are put into the heroes \u2019 mouths , their thoughts and designs \u2014 the chief of all this must be invention , and invention is what delights me in other books . \u201d \u201c Historians , you think , \u201d said Miss Tilney , \u201c are not happy in their flights of fancy . They display imagination without raising interest . I am fond of history \u2014 and am very well contented to take the false with the true . In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records , which may be as much depended on , I conclude , as anything that does not actually pass under one \u2019s own observation ; and as for the little embellishments you speak of , they are embellishments , and I like them as such . If a speech be well drawn up , I read it with pleasure , by whomsoever it may be made \u2014 and probably with much greater , if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson , than if the genuine words of Caractacus , Agricola , or Alfred the Great . \u201d \u201c You are fond of history ! and so are Mr. Allen and my father ; and I have two brothers who do not dislike it . So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable ! at this rate , I shall not pity the writers of history any longer . If people like to read their books , it is all very well , but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes , which , as I used to think , nobody would willingly ever look into , to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate ; and though I know it is all very right and necessary , I have often wondered at the person \u2019s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . \u201d \u201c That little boys and girls should be tormented , \u201d said Henry , \u201c is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny ; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians , I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim , and that by their method and style , they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life . I use the verb \u2018 to torment , \u2019 as I observed to be your own method , instead of \u2018 to instruct , \u2019 supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous . \u201d \u201c You think me foolish to call instruction a torment , but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell , if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together , and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it , as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home , you would allow that to _ torment _ and to _ instruct _ might sometimes be used as synonymous words . \u201d \u201c Very probably . But historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read ; and even you yourself , who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe , very intense application , may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth - while to be tormented for two or three years of one \u2019s life , for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it . Consider \u2014 if reading had not been taught , Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain \u2014 or perhaps might not have written at all . \u201d Catherine assented \u2014 and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady \u2019s merits closed the subject . The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on which she had nothing to say . They were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing , and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures , with all the eagerness of real taste . Here Catherine was quite lost . She knew nothing of drawing \u2014 nothing of taste : and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little profit , for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her . The little which she could understand , however , appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before . It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of an high hill , and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of a fine day . She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance . A misplaced shame . Where people wish to attach , they should always be ignorant . To come with a well - informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others , which a sensible person would always wish to avoid . A woman especially , if she have the misfortune of knowing anything , should conceal it as well as she can . The advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author ; and to her treatment of the subject I will only add , in justice to men , that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex , imbecility in females is a great enhancement of their personal charms , there is a portion of them too reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance . But Catherine did not know her own advantages \u2014 did not know that a good - looking girl , with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind , can not fail of attracting a clever young man , unless circumstances are particularly untoward . In the present instance , she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge , declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw ; and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed , in which his instructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in everything admired by him , and her attention was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste . He talked of foregrounds , distances , and second distances \u2014 side - screens and perspectives \u2014 lights and shades ; and Catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff , she voluntarily rejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape . Delighted with her progress , and fearful of wearying her with too much wisdom at once , Henry suffered the subject to decline , and by an easy transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak which he had placed near its summit , to oaks in general , to forests , the enclosure of them , waste lands , crown lands and government , he shortly found himself arrived at politics ; and from politics , it was an easy step to silence . The general pause which succeeded his short disquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by Catherine , who , in rather a solemn tone of voice , uttered these words , \u201c I have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London . \u201d Miss Tilney , to whom this was chiefly addressed , was startled , and hastily replied , \u201c Indeed ! and of what nature ? \u201d \u201c That I do not know , nor who is the author . I have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet . \u201d \u201c Good heaven ! where could you hear of such a thing ? \u201d \u201c A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from London yesterday . It is to be uncommonly dreadful . I shall expect murder and everything of the kind . \u201d \u201c You speak with astonishing composure ! but I hope your friend \u2019s accounts have been exaggerated ; and if such a design is known beforehand , proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect . \u201d \u201c Government , \u201d said Henry , endeavouring not to smile , \u201c neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters . There must be murder ; and government cares not how much . \u201d The ladies stared . He laughed , and added , \u201c Come , shall I make you understand each other , or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can ? No \u2014 I will be noble . I will prove myself a man , no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head . I have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours . Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute \u2014 neither vigorous nor keen . Perhaps they may want observation , discernment , judgment , fire , genius , and wit . \u201d \u201c Miss Morland , do not mind what he says ; but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot . \u201d \u201c Riot ! what riot ? \u201d \u201c My dear Eleanor , the riot is only in your own brain . The confusion there is scandalous . Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out , in three duodecimo volumes , two hundred and seventy - six pages in each , with a frontispiece to the first , of two tombstones and a lantern \u2014 do you understand ? And you , Miss Morland \u2014 my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions . You talked of expected horrors in London \u2014 and instead of instantly conceiving , as any rational creature would have done , that such words could relate only to a circulating library , she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George \u2019s Fields , the Bank attacked , the Tower threatened , the streets of London flowing with blood , a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons ( the hopes of the nation ) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents , and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney , in the moment of charging at the head of his troop , knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window . Forgive her stupidity . The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman ; but she is by no means a simpleton in general . \u201d Catherine looked grave . \u201c And now , Henry , \u201d said Miss Tilney , \u201c that you have made us understand each other , you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself \u2014 unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister , and a great brute in your opinion of women in general . Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways . \u201d \u201c I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them . \u201d \u201c No doubt ; but that is no explanation of the present . \u201d \u201c What am I to do ? \u201d \u201c You know what you ought to do . Clear your character handsomely before her . Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women . \u201d \u201c Miss Morland , I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world \u2014 especially of those \u2014 whoever they may be \u2014 with whom I happen to be in company . \u201d \u201c That is not enough . Be more serious . \u201d \u201c Miss Morland , no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do . In my opinion , nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half . \u201d \u201c We shall get nothing more serious from him now , Miss Morland . He is not in a sober mood . But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood , if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all , or an unkind one of me . \u201d It was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never be wrong . His manner might sometimes surprise , but his meaning must always be just : and what she did not understand , she was almost as ready to admire , as what she did . The whole walk was delightful , and though it ended too soon , its conclusion was delightful too ; her friends attended her into the house , and Miss Tilney , before they parted , addressing herself with respectful form , as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine , petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next . No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen \u2019s side , and the only difficulty on Catherine \u2019s was in concealing the excess of her pleasure . The morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her friendship and natural affection , for no thought of Isabella or James had crossed her during their walk . When the Tilneys were gone , she became amiable again , but she was amiable for some time to little effect ; Mrs. Allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety ; she had heard nothing of any of them . Towards the end of the morning , however , Catherine , having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment \u2019s delay , walked out into the town , and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe as she was loitering towards Edgar \u2019s Buildings between two of the sweetest girls in the world , who had been her dear friends all the morning . From her , she soon learned that the party to Clifton had taken place . \u201c They set off at eight this morning , \u201d said Miss Anne , \u201c and I am sure I do not envy them their drive . I think you and I are very well off to be out of the scrape . It must be the dullest thing in the world , for there is not a soul at Clifton at this time of year . Belle went with your brother , and John drove Maria . \u201d Catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of the arrangement . \u201c Oh ! yes , \u201d rejoined the other , \u201c Maria is gone . She was quite wild to go . She thought it would be something very fine . I can not say I admire her taste ; and for my part , I was determined from the first not to go , if they pressed me ever so much . \u201d Catherine , a little doubtful of this , could not help answering , \u201c I wish you could have gone too . It is a pity you could not all go . \u201d \u201c Thank you ; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me . Indeed , I would not have gone on any account . I was saying so to Emily and Sophia when you overtook us . \u201d Catherine was still unconvinced ; but glad that Anne should have the friendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her , she bade her adieu without much uneasiness , and returned home , pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it , and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella to resent her resistance any longer . 15 Early the next day , a note from Isabella , speaking peace and tenderness in every line , and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance , hastened Catherine , in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity , to Edgar \u2019s Buildings . The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour ; and , on Anne \u2019s quitting it to call her sister , Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday \u2019s party . Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it ; and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world , that nobody could imagine how charming it had been , and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive . Such was the information of the first five minutes ; the second unfolded thus much in detail \u2014 that they had driven directly to the York Hotel , ate some soup , and bespoke an early dinner , walked down to the pump - room , tasted the water , and laid out some shillings in purses and spars ; thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry - cook \u2019s , and hurrying back to the hotel , swallowed their dinner in haste , to prevent being in the dark ; and then had a delightful drive back , only the moon was not up , and it rained a little , and Mr. Morland \u2019s horse was so tired he could hardly get it along . Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction . It appeared that Blaize Castle had never been thought of ; and , as for all the rest , there was nothing to regret for half an instant . Maria \u2019s intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister Anne , whom she represented as insupportably cross , from being excluded the party . \u201c She will never forgive me , I am sure ; but , you know , how could I help it ? John would have me go , for he vowed he would not drive her , because she had such thick ankles . I dare say she will not be in good humour again this month ; but I am determined I will not be cross ; it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper . \u201d Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step , and a look of such happy importance , as engaged all her friend \u2019s notice . Maria was without ceremony sent away , and Isabella , embracing Catherine , thus began : \u201c Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you . Oh , that arch eye of yours ! it sees through everything . \u201d Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance . \u201c Nay , my beloved , sweetest friend , \u201d continued the other , \u201c compose yourself . I am amazingly agitated , as you perceive . Let us sit down and talk in comfort . Well , and so you guessed it the moment you had my note ? Sly creature ! oh ! my dear Catherine , you alone , who know my heart , can judge of my present happiness . Your brother is the most charming of men . I only wish I were more worthy of him . But what will your excellent father and mother say ? Oh ! heavens ! when I think of them I am so agitated ! \u201d Catherine \u2019s understanding began to awake : an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind ; and , with the natural blush of so new an emotion , she cried out , \u201c Good heaven ! my dear Isabella , what do you mean ? Can you \u2014 can you really be in love with James ? \u201d This bold surmise , however , she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact . The anxious affection , which she was accused of having continually watched in Isabella \u2019s every look and action , had , in the course of their yesterday \u2019s party , received the delightful confession of an equal love . Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James . Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest , wonder , and joy . Her brother and her friend engaged ! new to such circumstances , the importance of it appeared unspeakably great , and she contemplated it as one of those grand events , of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return . The strength of her feelings she could not express ; the nature of them , however , contented her friend . The happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion , and the fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy . Delighting , however , as Catherine sincerely did , in the prospect of the connection , it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations . \u201c You will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland \u2019s family than to my own . \u201d This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine . \u201c You are so like your dear brother , \u201d continued Isabella , \u201c that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you . But so it always is with me ; the first moment settles everything . The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas \u2014 the very first moment I beheld him \u2014 my heart was irrecoverably gone . I remember I wore my yellow gown , with my hair done up in braids ; and when I came into the drawing - room , and John introduced him , I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before . \u201d Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love ; for , though exceedingly fond of her brother , and partial to all his endowments , she had never in her life thought him handsome . \u201c I remember too , Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening , and wore her puce - coloured sarsenet ; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her ; I could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it . Oh ! catherine , the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother \u2019s account ! i would not have you suffer half what I have done ! i am grown wretchedly thin , I know ; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety ; you have seen enough of it . I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually \u2014 so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church ! but my secret I was always sure would be safe with _ you _ . \u201d Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer ; but ashamed of an ignorance little expected , she dared no longer contest the point , nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her . Her brother , she found , was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton , to make known his situation and ask consent ; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella . Catherine endeavoured to persuade her , as she was herself persuaded , that her father and mother would never oppose their son \u2019s wishes . \u201c It is impossible , \u201d said she , \u201c for parents to be more kind , or more desirous of their children \u2019s happiness ; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately . \u201d \u201c Morland says exactly the same , \u201d replied Isabella ; \u201c and yet I dare not expect it ; my fortune will be so small ; they never can consent to it . Your brother , who might marry anybody ! \u201d Here Catherine again discerned the force of love . \u201c Indeed , Isabella , you are too humble . The difference of fortune can be nothing to signify . \u201d \u201c Oh ! my sweet Catherine , in _ your _ generous heart I know it would signify nothing ; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many . As for myself , I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed . Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . \u201d This charming sentiment , recommended as much by sense as novelty , gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance ; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea . \u201c I am sure they will consent , \u201d was her frequent declaration ; \u201c I am sure they will be delighted with you . \u201d \u201c For my own part , \u201d said Isabella , \u201c my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me . Where people are really attached , poverty itself is wealth ; grandeur I detest : I would not settle in London for the universe . A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy . There are some charming little villas about Richmond . \u201d \u201c Richmond ! \u201d cried Catherine . \u201c You must settle near Fullerton . You must be near us . \u201d \u201c I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not . If I can but be near _ you _ , I shall be satisfied . But this is idle talking ! i will not allow myself to think of such things , till we have your father \u2019s answer . Morland says that by sending it to - night to Salisbury , we may have it to - morrow . To - morrow ? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter . I know it will be the death of me . \u201d A reverie succeeded this conviction \u2014 and when Isabella spoke again , it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding - gown . Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself , who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire . Catherine wished to congratulate him , but knew not what to say , and her eloquence was only in her eyes . From them , however , the eight parts of speech shone out most expressively , and James could combine them with ease . Impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home , his adieus were not long ; and they would have been yet shorter , had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go . Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone . \u201c Indeed , Morland , I must drive you away . Consider how far you have to ride . I can not bear to see you linger so . For heaven \u2019s sake , waste no more time . There , go , go \u2014 I insist on it . \u201d The two friends , with hearts now more united than ever , were inseparable for the day ; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along . Mrs. Thorpe and her son , who were acquainted with everything , and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland \u2019s consent , to consider Isabella \u2019s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family , were allowed to join their counsels , and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters . To Catherine \u2019s simple feelings , this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant , nor consistently supported ; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out , had its inconsistency been less their friend ; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their \u201c I know what \u201d ; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit , a display of family ingenuity , on one side in the mystery of an affected secret , on the other of undefined discovery , all equally acute . Catherine was with her friend again the next day , endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters ; a needful exertion , for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near , Isabella became more and more desponding , and before the letter arrived , had worked herself into a state of real distress . But when it did come , where could distress be found ? \u201c I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents , and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness , \u201d were the first three lines , and in one moment all was joyful security . The brightest glow was instantly spread over Isabella \u2019s features , all care and anxiety seemed removed , her spirits became almost too high for control , and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals . Mrs. Thorpe , with tears of joy , embraced her daughter , her son , her visitor , and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction . Her heart was overflowing with tenderness . It was \u201c dear John \u201d and \u201c dear Catherine \u201d at every word ; \u201c dear Anne and dear Maria \u201d must immediately be made sharers in their felicity ; and two \u201c dears \u201d at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned . John himself was no skulker in joy . He not only bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world , but swore off many sentences in his praise . The letter , whence sprang all this felicity , was short , containing little more than this assurance of success ; and every particular was deferred till James could write again . But for particulars Isabella could well afford to wait . The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland \u2019s promise ; his honour was pledged to make everything easy ; and by what means their income was to be formed , whether landed property were to be resigned , or funded money made over , was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern . She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment , and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities . She saw herself at the end of a few weeks , the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at Fullerton , the envy of every valued old friend in Putney , with a carriage at her command , a new name on her tickets , and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger . When the contents of the letter were ascertained , John Thorpe , who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to London , prepared to set off . \u201c Well , Miss Morland , \u201d said he , on finding her alone in the parlour , \u201c I am come to bid you good - bye . \u201d Catherine wished him a good journey . Without appearing to hear her , he walked to the window , fidgeted about , hummed a tune , and seemed wholly self - occupied . \u201c Shall not you be late at Devizes ? \u201d said Catherine . He made no answer ; but after a minute \u2019s silence burst out with , \u201c A famous good thing this marrying scheme , upon my soul ! a clever fancy of Morland \u2019s and Belle \u2019s . What do you think of it , Miss Morland ? _ I _ say it is no bad notion . \u201d \u201c I am sure I think it a very good one . \u201d \u201c Do you ? That \u2019s honest , by heavens ! i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however . Did you ever hear the old song , \u2018 Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? \u2019 I say , you will come to Belle \u2019s wedding , I hope . \u201d \u201c Yes ; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . \u201d \u201c And then you know\u201d\u2014twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh\u2014\u201cI say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . \u201d \u201c May we ? But I never sing . Well , I wish you a good journey . I dine with Miss Tilney to - day , and must now be going home . \u201d \u201c Nay , but there is no such confounded hurry . Who knows when we may be together again ? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight , and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me . \u201d \u201c Then why do you stay away so long ? \u201d replied Catherine \u2014 finding that he waited for an answer . \u201c That is kind of you , however \u2014 kind and good - natured . I shall not forget it in a hurry . But you have more good nature and all that , than anybody living , I believe . A monstrous deal of good nature , and it is not only good nature , but you have so much , so much of everything ; and then you have such \u2014 upon my soul , I do not know anybody like you . \u201d \u201c Oh ! dear , there are a great many people like me , I dare say , only a great deal better . Good morning to you . \u201d \u201c But I say , Miss Morland , I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long , if not disagreeable . \u201d \u201c Pray do . My father and mother will be very glad to see you . \u201d \u201c And I hope \u2014 I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . \u201d \u201c Oh ! dear , not at all . There are very few people I am sorry to see . Company is always cheerful . \u201d \u201c That is just my way of thinking . Give me but a little cheerful company , let me only have the company of the people I love , let me only be where I like and with whom I like , and the devil take the rest , say I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same . But I have a notion , Miss Morland , you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters . \u201d \u201c Perhaps we may ; but it is more than I ever thought of . And as to _ most matters _ , to say the truth , there are not many that I know my own mind about . \u201d \u201c By Jove , no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me . My notion of things is simple enough . Let me only have the girl I like , say I , with a comfortable house over my head , and what care I for all the rest ? Fortune is nothing . I am sure of a good income of my own ; and if she had not a penny , why , so much the better . \u201d \u201c Very true . I think like you there . If there is a good fortune on one side , there can be no occasion for any on the other . No matter which has it , so that there is enough . I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another . And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence . Good day . We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton , whenever it is convenient . \u201d And away she went . It was not in the power of all his gallantry to detain her longer . With such news to communicate , and such a visit to prepare for , her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge ; and she hurried away , leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address , and her explicit encouragement . The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother \u2019s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in Mr. and Mrs. Allen , by the communication of the wonderful event . How great was her disappointment ! the important affair , which many words of preparation ushered in , had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother \u2019s arrival ; and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people \u2019s happiness , with a remark , on the gentleman \u2019s side , in favour of Isabella \u2019s beauty , and on the lady \u2019s , of her great good luck . It was to Catherine the most surprising insensibility . The disclosure , however , of the great secret of James \u2019s going to Fullerton the day before , did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen . She could not listen to that with perfect calmness , but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment , wished she could have known his intention , wished she could have seen him before he went , as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother , and her kind compliments to all the Skinners .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 9],
