{"document": "26 From this time , the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people ; and Catherine found , with some surprise , that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella \u2019s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother . Their persuasion that the General would , upon this ground alone , independent of the objection that might be raised against her character , oppose the connection , turned her feelings moreover with some alarm towards herself . She was as insignificant , and perhaps as portionless , as Isabella ; and if the heir of the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself , at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest ? The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality , which , as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions , she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the General ; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money , which she had more than once heard him utter , and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children . They were so fully convinced , however , that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person for his father \u2019s consent , and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to come to Northanger than at the present time , that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own . But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella \u2019s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations . She proposed it to him accordingly ; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected . \u201c No , \u201d said he , \u201c my father \u2019s hands need not be strengthened , and Frederick \u2019s confession of folly need not be forestalled . He must tell his own story . \u201d \u201c But he will tell only half of it . \u201d \u201c A quarter would be enough . \u201d A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney . His brother and sister knew not what to think . Sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement , and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it . The General , meanwhile , though offended every morning by Frederick \u2019s remissness in writing , was free from any real anxiety about him , and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland \u2019s time at Northanger pass pleasantly . He often expressed his uneasiness on this head , feared the sameness of every day \u2019s society and employments would disgust her with the place , wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country , talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner , and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood . But then it was such a dead time of year , no wild - fowl , no game , and the Lady Frasers were not in the country . And it all ended , at last , in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston , they would take him by surprise there some day or other , and eat their mutton with him . Henry was greatly honoured and very happy , and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme . \u201c And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting , and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days . \u201d \u201c Well , well , we will take our chance some one of those days . There is no need to fix . You are not to put yourself at all out of your way . Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough . I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor \u2019s table . Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come on Monday ; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me . I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning ; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club . I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it . They are a set of very worthy men . They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year ; and I dine with them whenever I can . Tuesday , therefore , we may say is out of the question . But on Wednesday , I think , Henry , you may expect us ; and we shall be with you early , that we may have time to look about us . Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston , I suppose ; we shall be in the carriage by ten ; so , about a quarter before one on Wednesday , you may look for us . \u201d A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion , so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston ; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry , about an hour afterwards , came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting , and said , \u201c I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour . Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday , which bad weather , or twenty other causes , may prevent , I must go away directly , two days before I intended it . \u201d \u201c Go away ! \u201d said Catherine , with a very long face . \u201c And why ? \u201d \u201c Why ! how can you ask the question ? Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits , because I must go and prepare a dinner for you , to be sure . \u201d \u201c Oh ! not seriously ! \u201d \u201c Aye , and sadly too \u2014 for I had much rather stay . \u201d \u201c But how can you think of such a thing , after what the General said ? When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble , because _ anything _ would do . \u201d Henry only smiled . \u201c I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister \u2019s account and mine . You must know it to be so ; and the General made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . \u201d \u201c I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own . Good - bye . As to - morrow is Sunday , Eleanor , I shall not return . \u201d He went ; and , it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry \u2019s , she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right , however disagreeable to her his going . But the inexplicability of the General \u2019s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts . That he was very particular in his eating , she had , by her own unassisted observation , already discovered ; but why he should say one thing so positively , and mean another all the while , was most unaccountable ! how were people , at that rate , to be understood ? Who but Henry could have been aware of what his father was at ? From Saturday to Wednesday , however , they were now to be without Henry . This was the sad finale of every reflection : and Captain Tilney \u2019s letter would certainly come in his absence ; and Wednesday she was very sure would be wet . The past , present , and future were all equally in gloom . Her brother so unhappy , and her loss in Isabella so great ; and Eleanor \u2019s spirits always affected by Henry \u2019s absence ! what was there to interest or amuse her ? She was tired of the woods and the shrubberies \u2014 always so smooth and so dry ; and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house . The painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a consideration of the building . What a revolution in her ideas ! she , who had so longed to be in an abbey ! now , there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well - connected parsonage , something like Fullerton , but better : Fullerton had its faults , but Woodston probably had none . If Wednesday should ever come ! It did come , and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for . It came \u2014 it was fine \u2014 and Catherine trod on air . By ten o\u2019clock , the chaise and four conveyed the trio from the abbey ; and , after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles , they entered Woodston , a large and populous village , in a situation not unpleasant . Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler \u2019s shops which they passed . At the further end of the village , and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it , stood the parsonage , a new - built substantial stone house , with its semicircular sweep and green gates ; and , as they drove up to the door , Henry , with the friends of his solitude , a large Newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers , was ready to receive and make much of them . Catherine \u2019s mind was too full , as she entered the house , for her either to observe or to say a great deal ; and , till called on by the General for her opinion of it , she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting . Upon looking round it then , she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world ; but she was too guarded to say so , and the coldness of her praise disappointed him . \u201c We are not calling it a good house , \u201d said he . \u201c We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger \u2014 we are considering it as a mere parsonage , small and confined , we allow , but decent , perhaps , and habitable ; and altogether not inferior to the generality ; or , in other words , I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good . It may admit of improvement , however . Far be it from me to say otherwise ; and anything in reason \u2014 a bow thrown out , perhaps \u2014 though , between ourselves , if there is one thing more than another my aversion , it is a patched - on bow . \u201d Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits . The room in question was of a commodious , well - proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining - parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing - room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the General . It was a prettily shaped room , the windows reaching to the ground , and the view from them pleasant , though only over green meadows ; and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it . \u201c Oh ! why do not you fit up this room , Mr. Tilney ? What a pity not to have it fitted up ! it is the prettiest room I ever saw ; it is the prettiest room in the world ! \u201d \u201c I trust , \u201d said the General , with a most satisfied smile , \u201c that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady \u2019s taste ! \u201d \u201c Well , if it was my house , I should never sit anywhere else . Oh ! what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees \u2014 apple trees , too ! it is the prettiest cottage ! \u201d \u201c You like it \u2014 you approve it as an object \u2014 it is enough . Henry , remember that Robinson is spoken to about it . The cottage remains . \u201d Such a compliment recalled all Catherine \u2019s consciousness , and silenced her directly ; and , though pointedly applied to by the General for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings , nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her . The influence of fresh objects and fresh air , however , was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations ; and , having reached the ornamental part of the premises , consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow , on which Henry \u2019s genius had begun to act about half a year ago , she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure - ground she had ever been in before , though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner . A saunter into other meadows , and through part of the village , with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements , and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about , brought them to four o\u2019clock , when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three . At four they were to dine , and at six to set off on their return . Never had any day passed so quickly ! She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the General ; nay , that he was even looking at the side - table for cold meat which was not there . His son and daughter \u2019s observations were of a different kind . They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own , and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter \u2019s being oiled . At six o\u2019clock , the General having taken his coffee , the carriage again received them ; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit , so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations , that , could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son , Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it . 27 The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella : _ Bath , April _ My dearest Catherine , I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight , and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner . I really am quite ashamed of my idleness ; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing . I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath , but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other . Pray write to me soon , and direct to my own home . Thank God , we leave this vile place to - morrow . Since you went away , I have had no pleasure in it \u2014 the dust is beyond anything ; and everybody one cares for is gone . I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive . I am quite uneasy about your dear brother , not having heard from him since he went to Oxford ; and am fearful of some misunderstanding . Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it . The spring fashions are partly down ; and the hats the most frightful you can imagine . I hope you spend your time pleasantly , but am afraid you never think of me . I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together . I rejoice to say that the young man whom , of all others , I particularly abhor , has left Bath . You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away . Afterwards he got worse , and became quite my shadow . Many girls might have been taken in , for never were such attentions ; but I knew the fickle sex too well . He went away to his regiment two days ago , and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again . He is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw , and amazingly disagreeable . The last two days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis : I pitied his taste , but took no notice of him . The last time we met was in Bath Street , and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me ; I would not even look at him . He went into the pump - room afterwards ; but I would not have followed him for all the world . Such a contrast between him and your brother ! pray send me some news of the latter \u2014 I am quite unhappy about him ; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away , with a cold , or something that affected his spirits . I would write to him myself , but have mislaid his direction ; and , as I hinted above , am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss . Pray explain everything to his satisfaction ; or , if he still harbours any doubt , a line from himself to me , or a call at Putney when next in town , might set all to rights . I have not been to the Rooms this age , nor to the play , except going in last night with the Hodges , for a frolic , at half price : they teased me into it ; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone . We happened to sit by the Mitchells , and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out . I knew their spite : at one time they could not be civil to me , but now they are all friendship ; but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them . You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own . Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it \u2014 it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take . I wear nothing but purple now : I know I look hideous in it , but no matter \u2014 it is your dear brother \u2019s favourite colour . Lose no time , my dearest , sweetest Catherine , in writing to him and to me , Who ever am , etc . Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine . Its inconsistencies , contradictions , and falsehood struck her from the very first . She was ashamed of Isabella , and ashamed of having ever loved her . Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty , and her demands impudent . \u201c Write to James on her behalf ! no , James should never hear Isabella \u2019s name mentioned by her again . \u201d On Henry \u2019s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother \u2019s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation . When she had finished it\u2014\u201cSo much for Isabella , \u201d she cried , \u201c and for all our intimacy ! she must think me an idiot , or she could not have written so ; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her . I see what she has been about . She is a vain coquette , and her tricks have not answered . I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her . \u201d \u201c It will soon be as if you never had , \u201d said Henry . \u201c There is but one thing that I can not understand . I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time . Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ? \u201d \u201c I have very little to say for Frederick \u2019s motives , such as I believe them to have been . He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself . If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . \u201d \u201c Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ? \u201d \u201c I am persuaded that he never did . \u201d \u201c And only made believe to do so for mischief \u2019s sake ? \u201d Henry bowed his assent . \u201c Well , then , I must say that I do not like him at all . Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all . As it happens , there is no great harm done , because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose . But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? \u201d \u201c But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose \u2014 consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . \u201d \u201c It is very right that you should stand by your brother . \u201d \u201c And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe . But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . \u201d Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness . Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty , while Henry made himself so agreeable . She resolved on not answering Isabella \u2019s letter , and tried to think no more of it .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [17, 18], "text": "Catherine"}, {"position": [25, 26], "text":
