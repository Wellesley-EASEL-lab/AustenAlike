{"document": "14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together . Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs Harville 's children away as much as she could , every possible supply from Uppercross had been furnished , to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles , while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day ; and in short , it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable . Mary had had her evils ; but upon the whole , as was evident by her staying so long , she had found more to enjoy than to suffer . Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly . Charles laughed . \" Oh ! Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man . I do not know what he would be at . We asked him to come home with us for a day or two : Charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood , ' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come . I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart - broken man as Captain Benwick . \" Charles laughed again and said , \" Now Mary , you know very well how it really was . It was all your doing , \" ( turning to Anne . ) \" He fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross ; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off , his heart failed him , and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour , Mary knows it is . \" But Mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot , or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed . Anne 's good - will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard . She boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries . \" Oh ! he talks of you , \" cried Charles , \" in such terms-- \" Mary interrupted him . \" I declare , Charles , I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there . I declare , Anne , he never talks of you at all . \" \" No , \" admitted Charles , \" I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly . His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh ! I can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms ! Now Mary , I declare it was so , I heard it myself , and you were in the other room . ` Elegance , sweetness , beauty . ' Oh ! there was no end of Miss Elliot 's charms . \" \" And I am sure , \" cried Mary , warmly , \" it was a very little to his credit , if he did . Miss Harville only died last June . Such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , Lady Russell ? I am sure you will agree with me . \" \" I must see Captain Benwick before I decide , \" said Lady Russell , smiling . \" And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma'am , \" said Charles . \" Though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it . I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church 's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon . So , I give you notice , Lady Russell . \" \" Any acquaintance of Anne 's will always be welcome to me , \" was Lady Russell 's kind answer . \" Oh ! as to being Anne 's acquaintance , \" said Mary , \" I think he is rather my acquaintance , for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight . \" \" Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick . \" \" You will not find anything very agreeable in him , I assure you , ma'am . He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived . He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . He is not at all a well - bred young man . I am sure you will not like him . \" \" There we differ , Mary , \" said Anne . \" I think Lady Russell would like him . I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner . \" \" So do I , Anne , \" said Charles . \" I am sure Lady Russell would like him . He is just Lady Russell 's sort . Give him a book , and he will read all day long . \" \" Yes , that he will ! \" exclaimed Mary , tauntingly . \" He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop 's one 's scissors , or anything that happens . Do you think Lady Russell would like that ? \" Lady Russell could not help laughing . \" Upon my word , \" said she , \" I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as I may call myself . I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions . I wish he may be induced to call here . And when he does , Mary , you may depend upon hearing my opinion ; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand . \" \" You will not like him , I will answer for it . \" Lady Russell began talking of something else . Mary spoke with animation of their meeting with , or rather missing , Mr Elliot so extraordinarily . \" He is a man , \" said Lady Russell , \" whom I have no wish to see . His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . \" This decision checked Mary 's eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance . With regard to Captain Wentworth , though Anne hazarded no enquiries , there was voluntary communication sufficient . His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected . As Louisa improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week . He had not seen Louisa ; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger . He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father 's grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . Captain Benwick came not , however . He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week 's indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite . The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville 's little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme . Henrietta remained with Louisa ; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters . Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once , when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again . Though neither Henrietta , nor Louisa , nor Charles Hayter , nor Captain Wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in . Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain . It was a fine family - piece . Anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which Louisa 's illness must have so greatly shaken . But Mrs Musgrove , who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially , again and again , for all her attentions to them , concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing , with a happy glance round the room , that after all she had gone through , nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home . Louisa was now recovering apace . Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home , before her brothers and sisters went to school again . The Harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at Uppercross , whenever she returned . Captain Wentworth was gone , for the present , to see his brother in Shropshire . \" I hope I shall remember , in future , \" said Lady Russell , as soon as they were reseated in the carriage , \" not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays . \" Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters ; and sounds are quite innoxious , or most distressing , by their sort rather than their quantity . When Lady Russell not long afterwards , was entering Bath on a wet afternoon , and driving through the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place , amidst the dash of other carriages , the heavy rumble of carts and drays , the bawling of newspapermen , muffin - men and milkmen , and the ceaseless clink of pattens , she made no complaint . No , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like Mrs Musgrove , she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness . Anne did not share these feelings . She persisted in a very determined , though very silent disinclination for Bath ; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings , smoking in rain , without any wish of seeing them better ; felt their progress through the streets to be , however disagreeable , yet too rapid ; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived ? And looked back , with fond regret , to the bustles of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch . Elizabeth 's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest . Mr Elliot was in Bath . He had called in Camden Place ; had called a second time , a third ; had been pointedly attentive . If Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves , had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance , and proclaim the value of the connection , as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect . This was very wonderful if it were true ; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary , of his being \" a man whom she had no wish to see . \" She had a great wish to see him . If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree . Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath . She was put down in Camden Place ; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings , in Rivers Street .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [4, 5], "text": "Mary"}, {"position": [19, 20],
