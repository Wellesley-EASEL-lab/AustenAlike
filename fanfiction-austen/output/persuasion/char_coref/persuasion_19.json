{"document": "19 While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne , and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath , Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither . Before Mrs Croft had written , he was arrived , and the very next time Anne walked out , she saw him . Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay . They were in Milsom Street . It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple 's carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland 's , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance . He soon joined them again , successful , of course ; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes . Her ladyship 's carriage was a barouche , and did not hold more than four with any comfort . Miss Carteret was with her mother ; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies . There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot . Whoever suffered inconvenience , she must suffer none , but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two . The rain was a mere trifle , and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot . But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay ; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all , and her boots were so thick ! much thicker than Miss Anne 's ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal , that his cousin Anne 's boots were rather the thickest . It was fixed accordingly , that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage ; and they had just reached this point , when Anne , as she sat near the window , descried , most decidedly and distinctly , Captain Wentworth walking down the street . Her start was perceptible only to herself ; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world , the most unaccountable and absurd ! For a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . She was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and Mr Elliot ( always obliging ) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay 's . She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained . Why was she to suspect herself of another motive ? Captain Wentworth must be out of sight . She left her seat , she would go ; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half , or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was . She would see if it rained . She was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself , among a party of gentlemen and ladies , evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street . He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before ; he looked quite red . For the first time , since their renewed acquaintance , she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two . She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments . All the overpowering , blinding , bewildering , first effects of strong surprise were over with her . Still , however , she had enough to feel ! It was agitation , pain , pleasure , a something between delight and misery . He spoke to her , and then turned away . The character of his manner was embarrassment . She could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed . After a short interval , however , he came towards her , and spoke again . Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed : neither of them , probably , much the wiser for what they heard , and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly . They had by dint of being so very much together , got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness ; but he could not do it now . Time had changed him , or Louisa had changed him . There was consciousness of some sort or other . He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was . It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him . She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness . Lady Dalrymple 's carriage , for which Miss Elliot was growing very impatient , now drew up ; the servant came in to announce it . It was beginning to rain again , and altogether there was a delay , and a bustle , and a talking , which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot . At last Miss Elliot and her friend , unattended but by the servant , ( for there was no cousin returned ) , were walking off ; and Captain Wentworth , watching them , turned again to Anne , and by manner , rather than words , was offering his services to her . \" I am much obliged to you , \" was her answer , \" but I am not going with them . The carriage would not accommodate so many . I walk : I prefer walking . \" \" But it rains . \" \" Oh ! very little , Nothing that I regard . \" After a moment 's pause he said : \" Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , \" ( pointing to a new umbrella ) ; \" I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . \" She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , \" I am only waiting for Mr Elliot . He will be here in a moment , I am sure . \" She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in . Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly . There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring Anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a \" Good morning to you ! \" being all that she had time for , as she passed away . As soon as they were out of sight , the ladies of Captain Wentworth 's party began talking of them . \" Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin , I fancy ? \" \" Oh ! no , that is clear enough . One can guess what will happen there . He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe . What a very good - looking man ! \" \" Yes , and Miss Atkinson , who dined with him once at the Wallises , says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with . \" \" She is pretty , I think ; Anne Elliot ; very pretty , when one comes to look at her . It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister . \" \" Oh ! so do I. \" \" And so do I. No comparison . But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot . Anne is too delicate for them . \" Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin , if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place , without saying a word . She had never found it so difficult to listen to him , though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care , and though his subjects were principally such as were wo nt to be always interesting : praise , warm , just , and discriminating , of Lady Russell , and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay . But just now she could think only of Captain Wentworth . She could not understand his present feelings , whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not ; and till that point were settled , she could not be quite herself . She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time ; but alas ! alas ! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet . Another circumstance very essential for her to know , was how long he meant to be in Bath ; he had not mentioned it , or she could not recollect it . He might be only passing through . But it was more probable that he should be come to stay . In that case , so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath , Lady Russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere . Would she recollect him ? How would it all be ? She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick . It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell 's surprise ; and now , if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth , her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him . The following morning Anne was out with her friend , and for the first hour , in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain ; but at last , in returning down Pulteney Street , she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street . There were many other men about him , many groups walking the same way , but there was no mistaking him . She looked instinctively at Lady Russell ; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself . No , it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ) , she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell 's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him-- of her being , in short , intently observing him . She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell 's mind , the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes , the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace ! At last , Lady Russell drew back her head . \" Now , how would she speak of him ? \" \" You will wonder , \" said she , \" what has been fixing my eye so long ; but I was looking after some window - curtains , which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night . They described the drawing - room window - curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description . \" Anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . The part which provoked her most , was that in all this waste of foresight and caution , she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them . A day or two passed without producing anything . The theatre or the rooms , where he was most likely to be , were not fashionable enough for the Elliots , whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties , in which they were getting more and more engaged ; and Anne , wearied of such a state of stagnation , sick of knowing nothing , and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried , was quite impatient for the concert evening . It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple . Of course they must attend . It was really expected to be a good one , and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music . If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred . Elizabeth had turned from him , Lady Russell overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention . She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow . Mrs Smith gave a most good - humoured acquiescence . \" By all means , \" said she ; \" only tell me all about it , when you do come . Who is your party ? \" Anne named them all . Mrs Smith made no reply ; but when she was leaving her said , and with an expression half serious , half arch , \" Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to - morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you . \" Anne was startled and confused ; but after standing in a moment 's suspense , was obliged , and not sorry to be obliged , to hurry away .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 4], "text": "Admiral Croft"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "his"}, {"position": [32, 34], "text": "Mrs Croft"}],
