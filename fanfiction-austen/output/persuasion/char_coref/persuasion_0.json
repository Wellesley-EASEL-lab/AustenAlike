{"document": "[ Persuasion by Jane Austen 1818 ] 1 Sir Walter Elliot , of Kellynch Hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed . This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened : \" ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL . \" Walter Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , married , July 15 , 1784 , Elizabeth , daughter of James Stevenson , Esq . of South Park , in the county of Gloucester , by which lady ( who died 1800 ) he has issue Elizabeth , born June 1 , 1785 ; Anne , born August 9 , 1787 ; a still - born son , November 5 , 1789 ; Mary , born November 20 , 1791 . \" Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer 's hands ; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of Mary 's birth-- \" Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq . of Uppercross , in the county of Somerset , \" and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife . Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto:--\"Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset , \" and Sir Walter 's handwriting again in this finale:-- \" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq . , great grandson of the second Sir Walter . \" Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot 's character ; vanity of person and of situation . He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man . Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society . He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the Sir Walter Elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion . His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own . Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them . --Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father . She had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters . This friend , and Sir Walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance . Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot 's death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow . That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter 's continuing in singleness requires explanation . Be it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ) , prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake . For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do . Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother 's rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily . His two other children were of very inferior value . Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way-- she was only Anne . To Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god - daughter , favourite , and friend . Lady Russell loved them all ; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again . A few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem . He had never indulged much hope , he had now none , of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work . All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably . It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing . Anne haggard , Mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow 's foot about Lady Russell 's temples had long been a distress to him . Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment . Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . For thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing - rooms and dining - rooms in the country . Thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world . She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine - and - twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet - blood within the next twelvemonth or two . Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not . Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away . She had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of . The heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq . , whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her . She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot 's death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction . He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed . He was invited to Kellynch Hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came . The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married . Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth . Sir Walter has resented it . As the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; \" For they must have been seen together , \" he observed , \" once at Tattersall 's , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons . \" His disapprobation was expressed , but apparently very little regarded . Mr Elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased . This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by Elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father 's heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot 's eldest daughter . There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal . Yet so miserably had he conducted himself , that though she was at this present time ( the summer of 1814 ) wearing black ribbons for his wife , she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again . The disgrace of his first marriage might , perhaps , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring , have been got over , had he not done worse ; but he had , as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends , they had been informed , spoken most disrespectfully of them all , most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to , and the honours which were hereafter to be his own . This could not be pardoned . Such were Elizabeth Elliot 's sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy . But now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these . Her father was growing distressed for money . She knew , that when he now took up the Baronetage , it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople , and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd , his agent , from his thoughts . The Kellynch property was good , but not equal to Sir Walter 's apprehension of the state required in its possessor . While Lady Elliot lived , there had been method , moderation , and economy , which had just kept him within his income ; but with her had died all such right - mindedness , and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it . It had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter . He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town ; he had gone so far even as to say , \" Can we retrench ? Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ? \" and Elizabeth , to do her justice , had , in the first ardour of female alarm , set seriously to think what could be done , and had finally proposed these two branches of economy , to cut off some unnecessary charities , and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing - room ; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne , as had been the usual yearly custom . But these measures , however good in themselves , were insufficient for the real extent of the evil , the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards . Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy . She felt herself ill - used and unfortunate , as did her father ; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity , or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne . There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference . He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power , but he would never condescend to sell . No ; he would never disgrace his name so far . The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire , as he had received it . Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .", "clusters": [{"mentions":
