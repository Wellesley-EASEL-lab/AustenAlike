{"document": "10 Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur . Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either . They were more in love with him ; yet there it was not love . It was a little fever of admiration ; but it might , probably must , end in love with some . Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted , and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them . Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about , and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to . She did not attribute guile to any . It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning . There was no triumph , no pitiful triumph in his manner . He had , probably , never heard , and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter . He was only wrong in accepting the attentions ( for accepting must be the word ) of two young women at once . After a short struggle , however , Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field . Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change . He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him , Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death . It was Mary 's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta , and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to - morrow . Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise . One morning , about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion - house . It was a very fine November day , and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a long walk , and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them ; and when Mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , \" Oh , yes , I should like to join you very much , I am very fond of a long walk ; \" Anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient . She tried to dissuade Mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves ' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own . \" I can not imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk , \" said Mary , as she went up stairs . \" Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker ; and yet they would not have been pleased , if we had refused to join them . When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ? \" Just as they were setting off , the gentlemen returned . They had taken out a young dog , who had spoilt their sport , and sent them back early . Their time and strength , and spirits , were , therefore , exactly ready for this walk , and they entered into it with pleasure . Could Anne have foreseen such a junction , she would have staid at home ; but , from some feelings of interest and curiosity , she fancied now that it was too late to retract , and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves , who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance . Anne 's object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister . Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day , from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves , and withered hedges , and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn , that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness , that season which had drawn from every poet , worthy of being read , some attempt at description , or some lines of feeling . She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations ; but it was not possible , that when within reach of Captain Wentworth 's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves , she should not try to hear it ; yet she caught little very remarkable . It was mere lively chat , such as any young persons , on an intimate footing , might fall into . He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta . Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister . This distinction appeared to increase , and there was one speech of Louisa 's which struck her . After one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth , Captain Wentworth added : -- \" What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister ! They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills . They talked of coming into this side of the country . I wonder whereabouts they will upset to - day . Oh ! it does happen very often , I assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not . \" \" Ah ! You make the most of it , I know , \" cried Louisa , \" but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . \" It was spoken with enthusiasm . \" Had you ? \" cried he , catching the same tone ; \" I honour you ! \" And there was silence between them for a little while . Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again . The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by , unless some tender sonnet , fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year , with declining happiness , and the images of youth and hope , and spring , all gone together , blessed her memory . She roused herself to say , as they struck by order into another path , \" Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop ? \" But nobody heard , or , at least , nobody answered her . Winthrop , however , or its environs -- for young men are , sometimes to be met with , strolling about near home -- was their destination ; and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures , where the ploughs at work , and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence , and meaning to have spring again , they gained the summit of the most considerable hill , which parted Uppercross and Winthrop , and soon commanded a full view of the latter , at the foot of the hill on the other side . Winthrop , without beauty and without dignity , was stretched before them an indifferent house , standing low , and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm - yard . Mary exclaimed , \" Bless me ! here is Winthrop . I declare I had no idea ! Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . \" Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but \" No ! \" said Charles Musgrove , and \" No , no ! \" cried Louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly . Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , \" Oh ! no , indeed ! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ; \" and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not . After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations , it was settled between Charles and his two sisters , that he and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes , to see their aunt and cousins , while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill . Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth-- \" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . \" She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of . The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge - row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer ; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also . She turned through the same gate , but could not see them . Anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge - row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other . Mary sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on till she overtook her . Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre . They were speaking as they drew near . Louisa 's voice was the first distinguished . She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech . What Anne first heard was-- \" And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What ! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ? No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded . When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance ! \" \" She would have turned back then , but for you ? \" \" She would indeed . I am almost ashamed to say it . \" \" Happy for her , to have such a mind as yours at hand ! After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see . If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . But this , no doubt , you have been always doing . It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character , that no influence over it can be depended on . You are never sure of a good impression being durable ; everybody may sway it . Let those who would be happy be firm . Here is a nut , \" said he , catching one down from an upper bough . \" to exemplify : a beautiful glossy nut , which , blessed with original strength , has outlived all the storms of autumn . Not a puncture , not a weak spot anywhere . This nut , \" he continued , with playful solemnity , \" while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot , is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of . \" Then returning to his former earnest tone-- \" My first wish for all whom I am interested in , is that they should be firm . If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life , she will cherish all her present powers of mind . \" He had done , and was unanswered . It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth ! She could imagine what Louisa was feeling . For herself , she feared to move , lest she should be seen . While she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on . Before they were beyond her hearing , however , Louisa spoke again . \" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects , \" said she ; \" but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride . She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride . We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead . I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne ? \" After a moment 's pause , Captain Wentworth said-- \" Do you mean that she refused him ? \" \" Oh ! yes ; certainly . \" \" When did that happen ? \" \" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary . I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not . They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . \" The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more . Her own emotions still kept her fixed . She had much to recover from , before she could move . The listener 's proverbial fate was not absolutely hers ; she had heard no evil of herself , but she had heard a great deal of very painful import . She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth , and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation . As soon as she could , she went after Mary , and having found , and walked back with her to their former station , by the stile , felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected , and once more in motion together . Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give . Charles and Henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , Charles Hayter with them . The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two . In a long strip of meadow land , where there was ample space for all , they were thus divided , forming three distinct parties ; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation , and least complaisance , Anne necessarily belonged . She joined Charles and Mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles 's other arm ; but Charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife . Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when Mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while Anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all . This long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be Admiral Croft 's gig . He and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home . Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in , they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired ; it would save her a full mile , and they were going through Uppercross . The invitation was general , and generally declined . The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired , and Mary was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise . The walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister . The something might be guessed by its effects . \" Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired , \" cried Mrs Croft . \" Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . Here is excellent room for three , I assure you . If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four . You must , indeed , you must . \" Anne was still in the lane ; and though instinctively beginning to decline , she was not allowed to proceed . The Admiral 's kind urgency came in support of his wife 's ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and Captain Wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage . Yes ; he had done it . She was in the carriage , and felt that he had placed her there , that his will and his hands had done it , that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue , and his resolution to give her rest . She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her , which all these things made apparent . This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before . She understood him . He could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling . Though condemning her for the past , and considering it with high and unjust resentment , though perfectly careless of her , and though becoming attached to another , still he could not see her suffer , without the desire of giving her relief . It was a remainder of former sentiment ; it was an impulse of pure , though unacknowledged friendship ; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart , which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain , that she knew not which prevailed . Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given . They had travelled half their way along the rough lane , before she was quite awake to what they said . She then found them talking of \" Frederick . \" \" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy , \" said the Admiral ; \" but there is no saying which . He has been running after them , too , long enough , one would think , to make up his mind . Ay , this comes of the peace . If it were war now , he would have settled it long ago . We sailors , Miss Elliot , can not afford to make long courtships in time of war . How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ? \" \" We had better not talk about it , my dear , \" replied Mrs Croft , pleasantly ; \" for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . I had known you by character , however , long before . \" \" Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ? I do not like having such things so long in hand . I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch . Then there would always be company for them . And very nice young ladies they both are ; I hardly know one from the other . \" \" Very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed , \" said Mrs Croft , in a tone of calmer praise , such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother ; \" and a very respectable family . One could not be connected with better people . My dear Admiral , that post ! we shall certainly take that post . \" But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger ; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut , nor ran foul of a dung - cart ; and Anne , with some amusement at their style of driving , which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs , found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [5, 6], "text": "her"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "Anne"},
