{"document": "13 The remainder of Anne 's time at Uppercross , comprehending only two days , was spent entirely at the Mansion House ; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there , both as an immediate companion , and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future , which , in Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's distressed state of spirits , would have been difficulties . They had an early account from Lyme the next morning . Louisa was much the same . No symptoms worse than before had appeared . Charles came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account . He was tolerably cheerful . A speedy cure must not be hoped , but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted . In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville 's exertions as a nurse . \" She really left nothing for Mary to do . He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . Mary had been hysterical again this morning . When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good . He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do . \" Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon , and his father had at first half a mind to go with him , but the ladies could not consent . It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others , and increase his own distress ; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon . A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa . Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither , had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta ; but without Anne , it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon . They were indebted , the next day , to Charles Hayter , for all the minute knowledge of Louisa , which it was so essential to obtain every twenty - four hours . He made it his business to go to Lyme , and his account was still encouraging . The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger . Every report agreed in Captain Wentworth 's appearing fixed in Lyme . Anne was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded . \" What should they do without her ? They were wretched comforters for one another . \" And so much was said in this way , that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once . She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved . They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence . She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again . More than former happiness would be restored . There could not be a doubt , to her mind there was none , of what would follow her recovery . A few months hence , and the room now so deserted , occupied but by her silent , pensive self , might be filled again with all that was happy and gay , all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love , all that was most unlike Anne Elliot ! An hour 's complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell 's carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart . Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious . It stood the record of many sensations of pain , once severe , but now softened ; and of some instances of relenting feeling , some breathings of friendship and reconciliation , which could never be looked for again , and which could never cease to be dear . She left it all behind her , all but the recollection that such things had been . Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell 's house in September . It had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from . Her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the Lodge , and to gladden the eyes of its mistress . There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell 's joy in meeting her . She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross . But happily , either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or Lady Russell fancied her so ; and Anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty . When they came to converse , she was soon sensible of some mental change . The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest . She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath . Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her . There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject . They must speak of the accident at Lyme . Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and Captain Wentworth 's name must be mentioned by both . Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell . She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to Lady Russell 's eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa . When this was told , his name distressed her no longer . Lady Russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty - three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove . The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to Anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of Louisa . At the end of that period , Lady Russell 's politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , \" I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon . Anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ? It will be some trial to us both . \" Anne did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing-- \" I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it . \" She could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners ' . These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well - known apartments . In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself , \" These rooms ought to belong only to us . Oh , how fallen in their destination ! How unworthily occupied ! An ancient family to be so driven away ! Strangers filling their place ! \" No , except when she thought of her mother , and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside , she had no sigh of that description to heave . Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention . The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot 's not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter ! The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming-- \" Ay , a very bad business indeed . A new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress 's head , is not it , Miss Elliot ? This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! \" Admiral Croft 's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell , but they delighted Anne . His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible . \" Now , this must be very bad for you , \" said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie , \" to be coming and finding us here . I had not recollected it before , I declare , but it must be very bad . But now , do not stand upon ceremony . Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it . \" \" Another time , Sir , I thank you , not now . \" \" Well , whenever it suits you . You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door . A good place is not it ? But , \" ( checking himself ) , \" you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler 's room . Ay , so it always is , I believe . One man 's ways may be as good as another 's , but we all like our own best . And so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . \" Anne , finding she might decline it , did so , very gratefully . \" We have made very few changes either , \" continued the Admiral , after thinking a moment . \" Very few . We told you about the laundry - door , at Uppercross . That has been a very great improvement . The wonder was , how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did , so long ! You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however . I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father 's . A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot , \" ( looking with serious reflection ) , \" I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . Such a number of looking - glasses ! oh Lord ! there was no getting away from one 's self . So I got Sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now I am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that I never go near . \" Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say-- \" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft 's , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place . The breakfast - room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter . And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this . Pray say so , with my compliments . He will be glad to hear it . \" Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath . So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall , or of seeing him in company with her friend . Everything was safe enough , and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [4, 5], "text": "Anne"}, {"position": [24, 25],
