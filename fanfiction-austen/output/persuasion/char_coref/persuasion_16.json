{"document": "16 There was one point which Anne , on returning to her family , would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot 's being in love with Elizabeth , which was , her father 's not being in love with Mrs Clay ; and she was very far from easy about it , when she had been at home a few hours . On going down to breakfast the next morning , she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady 's side of meaning to leave them . She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said , that \" now Miss Anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; \" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper , \" That must not be any reason , indeed . I assure you I feel it none . She is nothing to me , compared with you ; \" and she was in full time to hear her father say , \" My dear madam , this must not be . As yet , you have seen nothing of Bath . You have been here only to be useful . You must not run away from us now . You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis , the beautiful Mrs Wallis . To your fine mind , I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification . \" He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself . Her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister . The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties , and promise to stay . In the course of the same morning , Anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her \" less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher . Had she been using any thing in particular ? \" \" No , nothing . \" \" Merely Gowland , \" he supposed . \" No , nothing at all . \" \" Ha ! he was surprised at that ; \" and added , \" certainly you can not do better than to continue as you are ; you can not be better than well ; or I should recommend Gowland , the constant use of Gowland , during the spring months . Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation , and you see what it has done for her . You see how it has carried away her freckles . \" If Elizabeth could but have heard this ! Such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened . But everything must take its chance . The evil of a marriage would be much diminished , if Elizabeth were also to marry . As for herself , she might always command a home with Lady Russell . Lady Russell 's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point , in her intercourse in Camden Place . The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour , and of Anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed . As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , \" Can this be Mr Elliot ? \" and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man . Everything united in him ; good understanding , correct opinions , knowledge of the world , and a warm heart . He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour , without pride or weakness ; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune , without display ; he judged for himself in everything essential , without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum . He was steady , observant , moderate , candid ; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness , which fancied itself strong feeling ; and yet , with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely , and a value for all the felicities of domestic life , which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess . She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage . Colonel Wallis said it , and Lady Russell saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice . Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay . It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in Mr Elliot 's great desire of a reconciliation . In Lady Russell 's view , it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth . Anne presumed , however , still to smile about it , and at last to mention \" Elizabeth . \" Lady Russell listened , and looked , and made only this cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth ! very well ; time will explain . \" It was a reference to the future , which Anne , after a little observation , felt she must submit to . She could determine nothing at present . In that house Elizabeth must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as \" Miss Elliot , \" that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible . Mr Elliot , too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months . A little delay on his side might be very excusable . In fact , Anne could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved . However it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself . They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times . He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . She knew it well ; and she remembered another person 's look also . They did not always think alike . His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers . It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister 's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them . The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and her daughter , the Honourable Miss Carteret ; and all the comfort of No.-- , Camden Place , was swept away for many days ; for the Dalrymples ( in Anne 's opinion , most unfortunately ) were cousins of the Elliots ; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly . Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility , and she must acknowledge herself disappointed . She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for \" our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret ; \" \" our cousins , the Dalrymples , \" sounded in her ears all day long . Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount , but had never seen any of the rest of the family ; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony , ever since the death of that said late viscount , when , in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter 's at the same time , there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch . No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland . The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner ; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself , no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch , and , consequently , there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed . How to have this anxious business set to rights , and be admitted as cousins again , was the question : and it was a question which , in a more rational manner , neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant . \" Family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in Laura Place , and would be living in style . She had been at Bath the year before , and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman . It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed , if it could be done , without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots . \" Sir Walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin . Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess . \" She was very much honoured , and should be happy in their acquaintance . \" The toils of the business were over , the sweets began . They visited in Laura Place , they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and the Honourable Miss Carteret , to be arranged wherever they might be most visible : and \" Our cousins in Laura Place,\"--\"Our cousin , Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , \" were talked of to everybody . Anne was ashamed . Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable , she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created , but they were nothing . There was no superiority of manner , accomplishment , or understanding . Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of \" a charming woman , \" because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody . Miss Carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth . Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better ; but yet \" it was an acquaintance worth having ; \" and when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value . Anne smiled and said , \" My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company . \" \" You are mistaken , \" said he gently , \" that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . My cousin Anne shakes her head . She is not satisfied . She is fastidious . My dear cousin \" ( sitting down by her ) , \" you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know ; but will it answer ? Will it make you happy ? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ? You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . \" \" Yes , \" sighed Anne , \" we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them ! \" then recollecting herself , and not wishing to be answered , she added , \" I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . I suppose \" ( smiling ) \" I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them . \" \" Pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims . In London , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in Bath ; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance . \" \" Well , \" said Anne , \" I certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place . \" \" I love your indignation , \" said he ; \" it is very natural . But here you are in Bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot . You talk of being proud ; I am called proud , I know , and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , I have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different . In one point , I am sure , my dear cousin , \" ( he continued , speaking lower , though there was no one else in the room ) \" in one point , I am sure , we must feel alike . We must feel that every addition to your father 's society , among his equals or superiors , may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him . \" He looked , as he spoke , to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father 's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her .", "clusters":
