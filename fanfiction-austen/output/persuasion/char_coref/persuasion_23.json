{"document": "23 One day only had passed since Anne 's conversation with Mrs Smith ; but a keener interest had succeeded , and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot 's conduct , except by its effects in one quarter , that it became a matter of course the next morning , still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street . She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner . Her faith was plighted , and Mr Elliot 's character , like the Sultaness Scheherazade 's head , must live another day . She could not keep her appointment punctually , however ; the weather was unfavourable , and she had grieved over the rain on her friends ' account , and felt it very much on her own , before she was able to attempt the walk . When she reached the White Hart , and made her way to the proper apartment , she found herself neither arriving quite in time , nor the first to arrive . The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time . She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said-- \" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . \" Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing . Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter 's engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper . Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation , and yet , as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk , she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars ; such as , \" how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over ; what my brother Hayter had said one day , and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister Hayter , and what the young people had wished , and what I said at first I never could consent to , but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well , \" and a great deal in the same style of open - hearted communication : minutiae which , even with every advantage of taste and delicacy , which good Mrs Musgrove could not give , could be properly interesting only to the principals . Mrs Croft was attending with great good - humour , and whenever she spoke at all , it was very sensibly . Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self - occupied to hear . \" And so , ma'am , all these thing considered , \" said Mrs Musgrove , in her powerful whisper , \" though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them . At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement . \" \" That is precisely what I was going to observe , \" cried Mrs Croft . \" I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement . I always think that no mutual-- \" \" Oh ! dear Mrs Croft , \" cried Mrs Musgrove , unable to let her finish her speech , \" there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement . It is what I always protested against for my children . It is all very well , I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement-- \" \" Yes , dear ma'am , \" said Mrs Croft , \" or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long . To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can . \" Anne found an unexpected interest here . She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , Captain Wentworth 's pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her . The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but Anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion . Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood . He looked at her with a smile , and a little motion of the head , which expressed , \" Come to me , I have something to say ; \" and the unaffected , easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was , strongly enforced the invitation . She roused herself and went to him . The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting , and though nearer to Captain Wentworth 's table , not very near . As she joined him , Captain Harville 's countenance re - assumed the serious , thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character . \" Look here , \" said he , unfolding a parcel in his hand , and displaying a small miniature painting , \" do you know who that is ? \" \" Certainly : Captain Benwick . \" \" Yes , and you may guess who it is for . But , \" ( in a deep tone , ) \" it was not done for her . Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ? I little thought then-- but no matter . This was drawn at the Cape . He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another ! It was a commission to me ! But who else was there to employ ? I hope I can allow for him . I am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another . He undertakes it ; \" ( looking towards Captain Wentworth , ) \" he is writing about it now . \" And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding , \" Poor Fanny ! she would not have forgotten him so soon ! \" \" No , \" replied Anne , in a low , feeling voice . \" That I can easily believe . \" \" It was not in her nature . She doted on him . \" \" It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . \" Captain Harville smiled , as much as to say , \" Do you claim that for your sex ? \" and she answered the question , smiling also , \" Yes . We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . It is , perhaps , our fate rather than our merit . We can not help ourselves . We live at home , quiet , confined , and our feelings prey upon us . You are forced on exertion . You have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions . \" \" Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , I do not think I shall grant ) , it does not apply to Benwick . He has not been forced upon any exertion . The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since . \" \" True , \" said Anne , \" very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ? If the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man 's nature , which has done the business for Captain Benwick . \" \" No , no , it is not man 's nature . I will not allow it to be more man 's nature than woman 's to be inconstant and forget those they do love , or have loved . I believe the reverse . I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . \" \" Your feelings may be the strongest , \" replied Anne , \" but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . It would be hard , indeed \" ( with a faltering voice ) , \" if woman 's feelings were to be added to all this . \" \" We shall never agree upon this question , \" Captain Harville was beginning to say , when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Wentworth 's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room . It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down ; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed , and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them , striving to catch sounds , which yet she did not think he could have caught . \" Have you finished your letter ? \" said Captain Harville . \" Not quite , a few lines more . I shall have done in five minutes . \" \" There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . I am in very good anchorage here , \" ( smiling at Anne , ) \" well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . Well , Miss Elliot , \" ( lowering his voice , ) \" as I was saying we shall never agree , I suppose , upon this point . No man and woman , would , probably . But let me observe that all histories are against you -- all stories , prose and verse . If I had such a memory as Benwick , I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman 's inconstancy . Songs and proverbs , all talk of woman 's fickleness . But perhaps you will say , these were all written by men . \" \" Perhaps I shall . Yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books . Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands . I will not allow books to prove anything . \" \" But how shall we prove anything ? \" \" We never shall . We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point . It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . We each begin , probably , with a little bias towards our own sex ; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle ; many of which circumstances ( perhaps those very cases which strike us the most ) may be precisely such as can not be brought forward without betraying a confidence , or in some respect saying what should not be said . \" \" Ah ! \" cried Captain Harville , in a tone of strong feeling , \" if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , ` God knows whether we ever meet again ! ' And then , if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth 's absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ` They can not be here till such a day , ' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if Heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still ! If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence ! I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts ! \" pressing his own with emotion . \" Oh ! \" cried Anne eagerly , \" I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow - creatures ! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object . I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone . \" She could not immediately have uttered another sentence ; her heart was too full , her breath too much oppressed . \" You are a good soul , \" cried Captain Harville , putting his hand on her arm , quite affectionately . \" There is no quarrelling with you . And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied . \" Their attention was called towards the others . Mrs Croft was taking leave . \" Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe , \" said she . \" I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend . To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , \" ( turning to Anne . ) \" We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? \" Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully . \" Yes , \" said he , \" very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute . I know you will not be sorry to be off . I shall be at your service in half a minute . \" Mrs Croft left them , and Captain Wentworth , having sealed his letter with great rapidity , was indeed ready , and had even a hurried , agitated air , which shewed impatience to be gone . Anne knew not how to understand it . She had the kindest \" Good morning , God bless you ! \" from Captain Harville , but from him not a word , nor a look ! He had passed out of the room without a look ! She had only time , however , to move closer to the table where he had been writing , when footsteps were heard returning ; the door opened , it was himself . He begged their pardon , but he had forgotten his gloves , and instantly crossing the room to the writing table , he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper , placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time , and hastily collecting his gloves , was again out of the room , almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it : the work of an instant ! The revolution which one instant had made in Anne , was almost beyond expression . The letter , with a direction hardly legible , to \" Miss A. E.-- , \" was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily . While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick , he had been also addressing her ! On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her . Anything was possible , anything might be defied rather than suspense . Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table ; to their protection she must trust , and sinking into the chair which he had occupied , succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written , her eyes devoured the following words : \" I can listen no longer in silence . I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach . You pierce my soul . I am half agony , half hope . Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever . I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago . Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman , that his love has an earlier death . I have loved none but you . Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant . You alone have brought me to Bath . For you alone , I think and plan . Have you not seen this ? Can you fail to have understood my wishes ? I had not waited even these ten days , could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write . I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others . Too good , too excellent creature ! You do us justice , indeed . You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . Believe it to be most fervent , most undeviating , in F. W. \" I must go , uncertain of my fate ; but I shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible . A word , a look , will be enough to decide whether I enter your father 's house this evening or never . \" Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from . Half and hour 's solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her ; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted , with all the restraints of her situation , could do nothing towards tranquillity . Every moment rather brought fresh agitation . It was overpowering happiness . And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation , Charles , Mary , and Henrietta all came in . The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle ; but after a while she could do no more . She began not to understand a word they said , and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself . They could then see that she looked very ill , were shocked and concerned , and would not stir without her for the world . This was dreadful . Would they only have gone away , and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure ; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting , and in desperation , she said she would go home . \" By all means , my dear , \" cried Mrs Musgrove , \" go home directly , and take care of yourself , that you may be fit for the evening . I wish Sarah was here to doctor you , but I am no doctor myself . Charles , ring and order a chair . She must not walk . \" But the chair would never do . Worse than all ! To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne . The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night . Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said-- \" I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both . \" \" Oh ! my dear , it is quite understood , I give you my word . Captain Harville has no thought but of going . \" \" Do you think so ? But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry . Will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ? You will see them both this morning , I dare say . Do promise me . \" \" To be sure I will , if you wish it . Charles , if you see Captain Harville anywhere , remember to give Miss Anne 's message . But indeed , my dear , you need not be uneasy . Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged , I 'll answer for it ; and Captain Wentworth the same , I dare say . \" Anne could do no more ; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity . It could not be very lasting , however . Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself , it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville . Another momentary vexation occurred . Charles , in his real concern and good nature , would go home with her ; there was no preventing him . This was almost cruel . But she could not be long ungrateful ; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith 's , to be of use to her ; and she set off with him , with no feeling but gratitude apparent . They were on Union Street , when a quicker step behind , a something of familiar sound , gave her two moments ' preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth . He joined them ; but , as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on , said nothing , only looked . Anne could command herself enough to receive that look , and not repulsively . The cheeks which had been pale now glowed , and the movements which had hesitated were decided . He walked by her side . Presently , struck by a sudden thought , Charles said-- \" Captain Wentworth , which way are you going ? Only to Gay Street , or farther up the town ? \" \" I hardly know , \" replied Captain Wentworth , surprised . \" Are you going as high as Belmont ? Are you going near Camden Place ? Because , if you are , I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give Anne your arm to her father 's door . She is rather done for this morning , and must not go so far without help , and I ought to be at that fellow 's in the Market Place . He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance . By his description , a good deal like the second size double - barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round Winthrop . \" There could not be an objection . There could be only the most proper alacrity , a most obliging compliance for public view ; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture . In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement . There they returned again into the past , more exquisitely happy , perhaps , in their re - union , than when it had been first projected ; more tender , more tried , more fixed in a knowledge of each other 's character , truth , and attachment ; more equal to act , more justified in acting . And there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery - maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest . All the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end . She had not mistaken him . Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings . Of what he had then written , nothing was to be retracted or qualified . He persisted in having loved none but her . She had never been supplanted . He never even believed himself to see her equal . Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done . He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself . At Lyme , he had received lessons of more than one sort . The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville 's had fixed her superiority . In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa 's could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way . From that period his penance had become severe . He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa 's accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty . \" I found , \" said he , \" that I was considered by Harville an engaged man ! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment . I was startled and shocked . To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal . I was hers in honour if she wished it . I had been unguarded . I had not thought seriously on this subject before . I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects . I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences . \" He found too late , in short , that he had entangled himself ; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all , he must regard himself as bound to her , if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed . It determined him to leave Lyme , and await her complete recovery elsewhere . He would gladly weaken , by any fair means , whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist ; and he went , therefore , to his brother 's , meaning after a while to return to Kellynch , and act as circumstances might require . \" I was six weeks with Edward , \" said he , \" and saw him happy . I could have no other pleasure . I deserved none . He enquired after you very particularly ; asked even if you were personally altered , little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter . \" Anne smiled , and let it pass . It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach . It is something for a woman to be assured , in her eight - and - twentieth year , that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth ; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne , by comparing it with former words , and feeling it to be the result , not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment . He had remained in Shropshire , lamenting the blindness of his own pride , and the blunders of his own calculations , till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick . \" Here , \" said he , \" ended the worst of my state ; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness ; I could exert myself ; I could do something . But to be waiting so long in inaction , and waiting only for evil , had been dreadful . Within the first five minutes I said , ` I will be at Bath on Wednesday , ' and I was . Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come ? and to arrive with some degree of hope ? You were single . It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past , as I did ; and one encouragement happened to be mine . I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others , but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man , at least , of better pretensions than myself ; and I could not help often saying , ` Was this for me ? ' \" Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said , but the concert still more . That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments . The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him : the moment of Mr Elliot 's appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy . \" To see you , \" cried he , \" in the midst of those who could not be my well - wishers ; to see your cousin close by you , conversing and smiling , and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match ! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you ! Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent , to consider what powerful supports would be his ! Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared ? How could I look on without agony ? Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you , was not the recollection of what had been , the knowledge of her influence , the indelible , immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done-- was it not all against me ? \" \" You should have distinguished , \" replied Anne . \" You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different . If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk . When I yielded , I thought it was to duty , but no duty could be called in aid here . In marrying a man indifferent to me , all risk would have been incurred , and all duty violated . \" \" Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus , \" he replied , \" but I could not . I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character . I could not bring it into play ; it was overwhelmed , buried , lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year . I could think of you only as one who had yielded , who had given me up , who had been influenced by any one rather than by me . I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery . I had no reason to believe her of less authority now . The force of habit was to be added . \" \" I should have thought , \" said Anne , \" that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this . \" \" No , no ! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give . I left you in this belief ; and yet , I was determined to see you again . My spirits rallied with the morning , and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here . \" At last Anne was at home again , and happier than any one in that house could have conceived . All the surprise and suspense , and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation , she re - entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last . An interval of meditation , serious and grateful , was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high - wrought felicity ; and she went to her room , and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment . The evening came , the drawing - rooms were lighted up , the company assembled . It was but a card party , it was but a mixture of those who had never met before , and those who met too often ; a commonplace business , too numerous for intimacy , too small for variety ; but Anne had never found an evening shorter . Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness , and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for , she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her . Mr Elliot was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him . The Wallises , she had amusement in understanding them . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret -- they would soon be innoxious cousins to her . She cared not for Mrs Clay , and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . With the Musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with Captain Harville , the kind - hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with Lady Russell , attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with Admiral and Mrs Croft , everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with Captain Wentworth , some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there . It was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said-- \" I have been thinking over the past , and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong , I mean with regard to myself ; and I must believe that I was right , much as I suffered from it , that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now . To me , she was in the place of a parent . Do not mistake me , however . I am not saying that she did not err in her advice . It was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , I certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice . But I mean , that I was right in submitting to her , and that if I had done otherwise , I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up , because I should have suffered in my conscience . I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman 's portion . \" He looked at her , looked at Lady Russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation-- \" Not yet . But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time . I trust to being in charity with her soon . But I too have been thinking over the past , and a question has suggested itself , whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady ? My own self . Tell me if , when I returned to England in the year eight , with a few thousand pounds , and was posted into the Laconia , if I had then written to you , would you have answered my letter ? Would you , in short , have renewed the engagement then ? \" \" Would I ! \" was all her answer ; but the accent was decisive enough . \" Good God ! \" he cried , \" you would ! It is not that I did not think of it , or desire it , as what could alone crown all my other success ; but I was proud , too proud to ask again . I did not understand you . I shut my eyes , and would not understand you , or do you justice . This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself . Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared . It is a sort of pain , too , which is new to me . I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed . I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards . Like other great men under reverses , \" he added , with a smile . \" I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune . I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [7, 8], "text": "Anne"}, {"position": [22, 23], "text": "she"}, {"position": [56, 57], "text": "her"},
