{"document": "18 It was the beginning of February ; and Anne , having been a month in Bath , was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme . She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated . It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that Henrietta was at home again ; and that Louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with Admiral and Mrs Croft 's compliments . The Crofts must be in Bath ! A circumstance to interest her . They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally . \" What is this ? \" cried Sir Walter . \" The Crofts have arrived in Bath ? The Crofts who rent Kellynch ? What have they brought you ? \" \" A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir . \" \" Oh ! those letters are convenient passports . They secure an introduction . I should have visited Admiral Croft , however , at any rate . I know what is due to my tenant . \" Anne could listen no longer ; she could not even have told how the poor Admiral 's complexion escaped ; her letter engrossed her . It had been begun several days back . \" February 1st . \" My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence , because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath . You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross , which , as you well know , affords little to write about . We have had a very dull Christmas ; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays . I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody . The holidays , however , are over at last : I believe no children ever had such long ones . I am sure I had not . The house was cleared yesterday , except of the little Harvilles ; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home . Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long . I do not understand it . They are not at all nice children , in my opinion ; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well , if not better , than her grandchildren . What dreadful weather we have had ! It may not be felt in Bath , with your nice pavements ; but in the country it is of some consequence . I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January , except Charles Hayter , who had been calling much oftener than was welcome . Between ourselves , I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way . The carriage is gone to - day , to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to - morrow . We are not asked to dine with them , however , till the day after , Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow . I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable , and wish I could be acquainted with him too ; but I have my usual luck : I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on ; always the last of my family to be noticed . What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth ! Does she never mean to go away ? But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant , we might not be invited . Let me know what you think of this . I do not expect my children to be asked , you know . I can leave them at the Great House very well , for a month or six weeks . I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately ; they think the Admiral gouty . Charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything . I do not think they improve at all as neighbours . We see nothing of them , and this is really an instance of gross inattention . Charles joins me in love , and everything proper . Yours affectionately , \" Mary M--- . \" I am sorry to say that I am very far from well ; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore - throat very much about . I dare say I shall catch it ; and my sore - throats , you know , are always worse than anybody 's . \" So ended the first part , which had been afterwards put into an envelope , containing nearly as much more . \" I kept my letter open , that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey , and now I am extremely glad I did , having a great deal to add . In the first place , I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like . The Admiral does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants . I shall be truly glad to have them back again . Our neighbourhood can not spare such a pleasant family . But now for Louisa . I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little . She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party , for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour ! Are not you astonished ? I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it , for I never did . Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to - day . Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister 's account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both . Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her . Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it . And this is the end , you see , of Captain Benwick 's being supposed to be an admirer of yours . How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . I hope he will be more agreeable now . Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove , but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters . \" Mary need not have feared her sister 's being in any degree prepared for the news . She had never in her life been more astonished . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! It was almost too wonderful for belief , and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room , preserve an air of calmness , and answer the common questions of the moment . Happily for her , they were not many . Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . \" How is Mary ? \" said Elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer , \" And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath ? \" \" They come on the Admiral 's account . He is thought to be gouty . \" \" Gout and decrepitude ! \" said Sir Walter . \" Poor old gentleman . \" \" Have they any acquaintance here ? \" asked Elizabeth . \" I do not know ; but I can hardly suppose that , at Admiral Croft 's time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this . \" \" I suspect , \" said Sir Walter coolly , \" that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall . Elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place ? \" \" Oh , no ! I think not . Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple , cousins , we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve . If we were not related , it would not signify ; but as cousins , she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours . We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level . There are several odd - looking men walking about here , who , I am told , are sailors . The Crofts will associate with them . \" This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth 's share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it . Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel ! Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her . She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend . She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other . Their minds most dissimilar ! Where could have been the attraction ? The answer soon presented itself . It had been in situation . They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta 's coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable . That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself . She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment . He had an affectionate heart . He must love somebody . She saw no reason against their being happy . Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike . He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry . The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste , and sentimental reflection was amusing , but she had no doubt of its being so . The day at Lyme , the fall from the Cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate . The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth 's merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . No , it was not regret which made Anne 's heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free . She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate . They were too much like joy , senseless joy ! She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them . The visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned , and Captain Benwick , too , without even half a smile . The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter 's satisfaction . He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him . The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for , and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form , and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure . They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together . He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good . Anne saw them wherever she went . Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral . He was standing by himself at a printshop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she not only might have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice . When he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour . \" Ha ! is it you ? Thank you , thank you . This is treating me like a friend . Here I am , you see , staring at a picture . I can never get by this shop without stopping . But what a thing here is , by way of a boat ! Do look at it . Did you ever see the like ? What queer fellows your fine painters must be , to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that ? And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease , and looking about them at the rocks and mountains , as if they were not to be upset the next moment , which they certainly must be . I wonder where that boat was built ! \" ( laughing heartily ) ; \" I would not venture over a horsepond in it . Well , \" ( turning away ) , \" now , where are you bound ? Can I go anywhere for you , or with you ? Can I be of any use ? \" \" None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together . I am going home . \" \" That I will , with all my heart , and farther , too . Yes , yes we will have a snug walk together , and I have something to tell you as we go along . There , take my arm ; that 's right ; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there . Lord ! what a boat it is ! \" taking a last look at the picture , as they began to be in motion . \" Did you say that you had something to tell me , sir ? \" \" Yes , I have , presently . But here comes a friend , Captain Brigden ; I shall only say , ` How d'ye do ? ' as we pass , however . I shall not stop . ` How d'ye do ? ' Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife . She , poor soul , is tied by the leg . She has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three - shilling piece . If you look across the street , you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother . Shabby fellows , both of them ! I am glad they are not on this side of the way . Sophy can not bear them . They played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men . I will tell you the whole story another time . There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson . Look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife . Ah ! the peace has come too soon for that younker . Poor old Sir Archibald ! How do you like Bath , Miss Elliot ? It suits us very well . We are always meeting with some old friend or other ; the streets full of them every morning ; sure to have plenty of chat ; and then we get away from them all , and shut ourselves in our lodgings , and draw in our chairs , and are snug as if we were at Kellynch , ay , or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal . We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth . The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . \" When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont ; and as she was not really Mrs Croft , she must let him have his own way . As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont , he began-- \" Well , now you shall hear something that will surprise you . But first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about . That young lady , you know , that we have all been so concerned for . The Miss Musgrove , that all this has been happening to . Her Christian name : I always forget her Christian name . \" Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of \" Louisa . \" \" Ay , ay , Miss Louisa Musgrove , that is the name . I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names . I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort . Well , this Miss Louisa , we all thought , you know , was to marry Frederick . He was courting her week after week . The only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at Lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right . But even then there was something odd in their way of going on . Instead of staying at Lyme , he went off to Plymouth , and then he went off to see Edward . When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward 's , and there he has been ever since . We have seen nothing of him since November . Even Sophy could not understand it . But now , the matter has take the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry Frederick , is to marry James Benwick . You know James Benwick . \" \" A little . I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick . \" \" Well , she is to marry him . Nay , most likely they are married already , for I do not know what they should wait for . \" \" I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man , \" said Anne , \" and I understand that he bears an excellent character . \" \" Oh ! yes , yes , there is not a word to be said against James Benwick . He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of . An excellent , good - hearted fellow , I assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . \" \" Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick 's manners . I thought them particularly pleasing , and I will answer for it , they would generally please . \" \" Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I can not help thinking Frederick 's manners better than his . There is something about Frederick more to our taste . \" Anne was caught . She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick 's manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , \" I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , \" but the Admiral interrupted her with-- \" And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip . We have it from Frederick himself . His sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from Harville , written upon the spot , from Uppercross . I fancy they are all at Uppercross . \" This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , \" I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy . It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence . I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill - used man . \" \" Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . \" Anne looked down to hide her smile . \" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that . If the girl likes another man better , it is very fit she should have him . \" \" Certainly . But what I mean is , that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth 's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill - used by his friend , which might appear , you know , without its being absolutely said . I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed , or even wounded , by a circumstance of this sort . \" \" Yes , yes , I understand you . But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter . He does not give the least fling at Benwick ; does not so much as say , ` I wonder at it , I have a reason of my own for wondering at it . ' No , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this Miss ( what 's her name ? ) for himself . He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think . \" Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey , but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther . She therefore satisfied herself with common - place remarks or quiet attention , and the Admiral had it all his own way . \" Poor Frederick ! \" said he at last . \" Now he must begin all over again with somebody else . I think we must get him to Bath . Sophy must write , and beg him to come to Bath . Here are pretty girls enough , I am sure . It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson . Do not you think , Miss Elliot , we had better try to get him to Bath ? \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 10], "text": "Anne"}, {"position": [29, 30], "text": "She"}, {"position": [45,
