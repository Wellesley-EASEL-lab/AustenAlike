{"document": "2 Mr Shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter , would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted . Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration . She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities , whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great , from the opposition of two leading principles . She was of strict integrity herself , with a delicate sense of honour ; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter 's feelings , as solicitous for the credit of the family , as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them , as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding . She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . Herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and Sir Walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of Anne and her sisters , was , as being Sir Walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt . But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth . She drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted Anne , who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question . She consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter . Every emendation of Anne 's had been on the side of honesty against importance . She wanted more vigorous measures , a more complete reformation , a quicker release from debt , a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity . \" If we can persuade your father to all this , \" said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , \" much may be done . If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . \" This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . She wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated Lady Russell 's influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation . Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell 's too gentle reductions . How Anne 's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence . Lady Russell 's had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne . \" What ! every comfort of life knocked off ! Journeys , London , servants , horses , table-- contractions and restrictions every where ! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman ! No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms . \" \" Quit Kellynch Hall . \" The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd , whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter 's retrenching , and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode . \" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , \" he said , \" in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side . It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support . In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household . \" Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out . There had been three alternatives , London , Bath , or another house in the country . All Anne 's wishes had been for the latter . A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have Lady Russell 's society , still be near Mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition . But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home . Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred . It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament : he might there be important at comparatively little expense . Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell 's spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there . Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne 's known wishes . It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood . Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to Sir Walter 's feelings they must have been dreadful . And with regard to Anne 's dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother 's death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend 's health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good . Anne had been too little from home , too little seen . Her spirits were not high . A larger society would improve them . She wanted her to be more known . The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part , and a very material part of the scheme , which had been happily engrafted on the beginning . He was not only to quit his home , but to see it in the hands of others ; a trial of fortitude , which stronger heads than Sir Walter 's have found too much . Kellynch Hall was to be let . This , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle . Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house . Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word \" advertise , \" but never dared approach it again . Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all . How quick come the reasons for approving what we like ! Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand , for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country . Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted . It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father 's house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve . Lady Russell , indeed , had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth , and seemed to love her , rather because she would love her , than because Elizabeth deserved it . She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility . From situation , Mrs Clay was , in Lady Russell 's estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot 's reach , was therefore an object of first - rate importance . 3 \" I must take leave to observe , Sir Walter , \" said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall , as he laid down the newspaper , \" that the present juncture is much in our favour . This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore . They will be all wanting a home . Could not be a better time , Sir Walter , for having a choice of tenants , very responsible tenants . Many a noble fortune has been made during the war . If a rich admiral were to come in our way , Sir Walter-- \" \" He would be a very lucky man , Shepherd , \" replied Sir Walter ; \" that 's all I have to remark . A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him ; rather the greatest prize of all , let him have taken ever so many before ; hey , Shepherd ? \" Mr Shepherd laughed , as he knew he must , at this wit , and then added-- \" I presume to observe , Sir Walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with . Therefore , Sir Walter , what I would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; I , John Shepherd , might conceal any family - matters that I chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much I venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as I was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying . \" Sir Walter only nodded . But soon afterwards , rising and pacing the room , he observed sarcastically-- \" There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description . \" \" They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune , \" said Mrs Clay , for Mrs Clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay 's health as a drive to Kellynch : \" but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant . I have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways ! These valuable pictures of yours , Sir Walter , if you chose to leave them , would be perfectly safe . Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of ! The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now . You need not be afraid , Miss Elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected . \" \" As to all that , \" rejoined Sir Walter coolly , \" supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing . I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier . \" After a short pause , Mr Shepherd presumed to say-- \" In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . Your interest , Sir Walter , is in pretty safe hands . Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights . I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him . \" Here Anne spoke-- \" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give . Sailors work hard enough for their comforts , we must all allow . \" \" Very true , very true . What Miss Anne says , is very true , \" was Mr Shepherd 's rejoinder , and \" Oh ! certainly , \" was his daughter 's ; but Sir Walter 's remark was , soon afterwards-- \" The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it . \" \" Indeed ! \" was the reply , and with a look of surprise . \" Yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; I have two strong grounds of objection to it . First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man 's youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . I have observed it all my life . A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ` In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? ' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ) . ` Old fellow ! ' cried Sir Basil , ` it is Admiral Baldwin . What do you take his age to be ? ' ` Sixty , ' said I , ` or perhaps sixty - two . ' ` Forty , ' replied Sir Basil , ` forty , and no more . ' Picture to yourselves my amazement ; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin . I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea - faring life can do ; but to a degree , I know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen . It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach Admiral Baldwin 's age . \" \" Nay , Sir Walter , \" cried Mrs Clay , \" this is being severe indeed . Have a little mercy on the poor men . We are not all born to be handsome . The sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; I have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth . But then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ? Soldiers , in active service , are not at all better off : and even in the quieter professions , there is a toil and a labour of the mind , if not of the body , which seldom leaves a man 's looks to the natural effect of time . The lawyer plods , quite care - worn ; the physician is up at all hours , and travelling in all weather ; and even the clergyman-- \" she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman , you know is obliged to go into infected rooms , and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere . In fact , as I have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young . \" It seemed as if Mr Shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter 's good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent . By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make , Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold , Mr Shepherd observed , Sir Walter 's concerns could not be kept a secret,)-- accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let , and understanding his ( Mr Shepherd 's ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given Mr Shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant . \" And who is Admiral Croft ? \" was Sir Walter 's cold suspicious inquiry . Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman 's family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added-- \" He is a rear admiral of the white . He was in the Trafalgar action , and has been in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years . \" \" Then I take it for granted , \" observed Sir Walter , \" that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery . \" Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman . Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral 's family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant . He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for . A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over . \" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , \" continued he ; \" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me ! what was his name ? At this moment I can not recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately . Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft 's brother ? \" But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot , that she did not hear the appeal . \" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent . \" \" Bless me ! how very odd ! I shall forget my own name soon , I suppose . A name that I am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , I remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer 's man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise . Very odd indeed ! \" After waiting another moment-- \" You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ? \" said Anne . Mr Shepherd was all gratitude . \" Wentworth was the very name ! Mr Wentworth was the very man . He had the curacy of Monkford , you know , Sir Walter , some time back , for two or three years . Came there about the year ---5 , I take it . You remember him , I am sure . \" \" Wentworth ? Oh ! ay,--Mr Wentworth , the curate of Monkford . You misled me by the term gentleman . I thought you were speaking of some man of property : Mr Wentworth was nobody , I remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the Strafford family . One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common . \" As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter 's estimate of the dues of a tenant . It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen . Sir Walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than Admiral Croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer . So far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the Admiral 's situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high . \" I have let my house to Admiral Croft , \" would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere Mr-- ; a Mr ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation , ) always needs a note of explanation . An admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small . In all their dealings and intercourse , Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence . Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her . Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act ; and no sooner had such an end been reached , than Anne , who had been a most attentive listener to the whole , left the room , to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks ; and as she walked along a favourite grove , said , with a gentle sigh , \" A few months more , and he , perhaps , may be walking here . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions":
