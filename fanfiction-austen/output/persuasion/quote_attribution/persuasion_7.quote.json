You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word . It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima . Oh ! I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone .
