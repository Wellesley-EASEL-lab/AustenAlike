In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement . There they returned again into the past , more exquisitely happy , perhaps , in their re - union , than when it had been first projected ; more tender , more tried , more fixed in a knowledge of each other 's character , truth , and attachment ; more equal to act , more justified in acting . And there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery - maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest . All the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end . She had not mistaken him . Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings . Of what he had then written , nothing was to be retracted or qualified . He persisted in having loved none but her . She had never been supplanted . He never even believed himself to see her equal . Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done . He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself . At Lyme , he had received lessons of more than one sort . The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville 's had fixed her superiority . In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa 's could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way . From that period his penance had become severe . He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa 's accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty . \""}], "her father": [{"position": [3809, 4014], "text": "Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from .
