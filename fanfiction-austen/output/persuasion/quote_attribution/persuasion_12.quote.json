There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley , after his illness , last spring twelve - month . He declares himself , that coming to Lyme for a month , did him more good than all the medicine he took ; and , that being by the sea , always makes him feel young again . Now , I can not help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme . Do not you , Anne ? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ? She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure . Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world . I wish his friends would propose it to him . I really think they ought . And , as to procuring a dispensation , there could be no difficulty at his time of life , and with his character . My only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over - scrupulous I must say . Do not you think , Anne , it is being over - scrupulous ? Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ? And at Lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of . \""}], "Dr Shirley": [{"position": [619, 623], "text": "I wish , \""}, {"position": [634, 722], "text": "I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross , and were intimate with Dr Shirley .
