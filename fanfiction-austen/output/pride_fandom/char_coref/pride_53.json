{"document": "LIII . Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . The day of his and Lydia \u2019s departure soon came ; and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . \u201c Oh , my dear Lydia , \u201d she cried , \u201c when shall we meet again ? \u201d \u201c Oh , Lord ! I do n\u2019t know . Not these two or three years , perhaps . \u201d \u201c Write to me very often , my dear . \u201d \u201c As often as I can . But you know married women have never much time for writing . My sisters may write to _ me _ . They will have nothing else to do . \u201d Mr. Wickham \u2019s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife \u2019s . He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . \u201c He is as fine a fellow , \u201d said Mr. Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , \u201c as ever I saw . He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . I am prodigiously proud of him . I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son - in - law . \u201d The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days . \u201c I often think , \u201d said she , \u201c that there is nothing so bad as parting with one \u2019s friends . One seems so forlorn without them . \u201d \u201c This is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . \u201d \u201c It is no such thing . Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband \u2019s regiment happens to be so far off . If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . \u201d But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news which then began to be in circulation . The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets . She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head , by turns . \u201c Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , \u201d ( for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news ) . \u201c Well , so much the better . Not that I care about it , though . He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . And who knows what _ may _ happen ? But that is nothing to us . You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . And so , it is quite certain he is coming ? \u201d \u201c You may depend on it , \u201d replied the other , \u201c for Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton last night : I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certainly true . He comes down on Thursday , at the latest , very likely on Wednesday . She was going to the butcher \u2019s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . \u201d Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour . It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said,-- \u201c I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed ; but do n\u2019t imagine it was from any silly cause . I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I _ should _ be looked at . I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people \u2019s remarks . \u201d Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _ with _ his friend \u2019s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . \u201c Yet it is hard , \u201d she sometimes thought , \u201c that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! I _ will _ leave him to himself . \u201d In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . \u201c As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , \u201c you will wait on him , of course . \u201d \u201c No , no . You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool \u2019s errand again . \u201d His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . \u201c \u2019 Tis an _ etiquette _ I despise , \u201d said he . \u201c If he wants our society , let him seek it . He knows where we live . I will not spend _ my _ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . \u201d \u201c Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . But , however , that sha n\u2019t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon . That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . \u201d Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband \u2019s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley , in consequence of it , before _ they _ did . As the day of his arrival drew near,-- \u201c I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , \u201d said Jane to her sister . \u201c It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference ; but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says . Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over ! \u201d \u201c I wish I could say anything to comfort you , \u201d replied Elizabeth ; \u201c but it is wholly out of my power . You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . \u201d Mr. Bingley arrived . Mrs. Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could . She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent -- hopeless of seeing him before . But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked -- she saw Mr. Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . \u201c There is a gentleman with him , mamma , \u201d said Kitty ; \u201c who can it be ? \u201d \u201c Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . \u201d \u201c La ! \u201d replied Kitty , \u201c it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . Mr. what \u2019s his name -- that tall , proud man . \u201d \u201c Good gracious ! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does , I vow . Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley \u2019s will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . \u201d Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter . Both sisters were uncomfortable enough . Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley \u2019s friend , without being heard by either of them . But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner \u2019s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merits she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . Her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken ; but she would not be secure . \u201c Let me first see how he behaves , \u201d said she ; \u201c it will then be early enough for expectation . \u201d She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door . Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected . On the gentlemen \u2019s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . He looked serious as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . But , perhaps , he could not in her mother \u2019s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend . Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . Darcy , after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did -- a question which she could not answer without confusion -- said scarcely anything . He was not seated by her : perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . There he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself . But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please , than when they last met , were plainly expressed . She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . \u201c Could I expect it to be otherwise ? \u201d said she . \u201c Yet why did he come ? \u201d She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . She inquired after his sister , but could do no more . \u201c It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet . He readily agreed to it . \u201c I began to be afraid you would never come back again . People _ did _ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away . Miss Lucas is married and settled : and one of my own daughters . I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . It was in the \u2018 Times \u2019 and the \u2018 Courier , \u2019 I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . It was only said , \u2018 Lately , George Wickham , Esq . , to Miss Lydia Bennet , \u2019 without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything . It was my brother Gardiner \u2019s drawing up , too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . Did you see it ? \u201d Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . How Mr. Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . \u201c It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , \u201d continued her mother ; \u201c but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken away from me . They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the Regulars . Thank heaven ! he has _ some _ friends , though , perhaps , not so many as he deserves . \u201d Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy , was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat . It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . A few weeks , he believed . \u201c When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , \u201d said her mother , \u201c I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet \u2019s manor . I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the coveys for you . \u201d Elizabeth \u2019s misery increased at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , everything , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion . \u201c The first wish of my heart , \u201d said she to herself , \u201c is never more to be in company with either of them . Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! Let me never see either one or the other again ! \u201d Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover . When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good - natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever ; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days \u2019 time . \u201c You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , \u201d she added ; \u201c for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned . I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . \u201d Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business . They then went away . Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 4], "text": "Mr. Wickham"},
