{"document": "XII . In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . But Mrs. Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane \u2019s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth \u2019s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley \u2019s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow their going was deferred . Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay ; for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence : Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . She attracted him more than he liked ; and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _ her _ and more teasing than usual to himself . He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _ now _ escape him -- nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that , if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . Steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday : and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her . On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . Miss Bingley \u2019s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to . Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle ; a private had been flogged ; and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 12], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [17, 18], "text": "her"}, {"position": [87, 88], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [149, 150], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [156, 157], "text": "she"}, {"position": [180, 181], "text": "she"}, {"position": [340, 341], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [505, 506], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [527, 529], "text": "the latter"}, {"position": [560, 561], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [670, 671], "text": "Elizabeth"}], "name": "Elizabeth"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [17, 19], "text": "her mother"}, {"position": [38, 40], "text": "Mrs. Bennet"}, {"position": [45, 46], "text": "her"}, {"position": [66, 67], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [74, 75], "text": "Her"}, {"position": [92, 93], "text": "she"}, {"position": [99, 101], "text": "Mrs. Bennet"}, {"position": [117, 118], "text": "her"}, {"position": [136, 137], "text": "she"}, {"position": [302, 304], "text": "Miss Bennet"}, {"position": [311, 312], "text": "her"}, {"position": [314, 315], "text": "she"}, {"position": [580, 582], "text": "their mother"}, {"position": [583, 585], "text": "Mrs. Bennet"}], "name": "Mrs. Bennet"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [125, 127], "text": "Mr. Bingley"}, {"position": [128, 129], "text": "his"}, {"position": [185, 187], "text": "Mr. Bingley"}, {"position": [252, 254], "text": "Miss Bingley"}, {"position": [258, 259], "text": "she"}, {"position": [265, 266], "text": "her"}, {"position": [274, 275], "text": "her"}, {"position": [333, 335], "text": "Mr. Darcy"}, {"position": [350, 351], "text": "him"}, {"position": [353, 354], "text": "he"}, {"position": [357, 359], "text": "Miss Bingley"}, {"position": [371, 372], "text": "himself"}, {"position": [373, 374], "text": "He"}, {"position": [390, 391], "text": "him"}, {"position": [402, 403], "text": "his"}, {"position": [416, 417], "text": "his"}, {"position": [434, 435], "text": "his"}, {"position": [437, 438], "text": "he"}, {"position": [465, 466], "text": "he"}, {"position": [470, 471], "text": "his"}, {"position": [500, 502], "text": "Miss Bingley"}, {"position": [515, 516], "text": "her"}, {"position": [536, 537], "text": "her"}, {"position": [539, 540], "text": "her"}, {"position": [548, 549], "text": "her"}, {"position": [552, 553], "text": "she"}], "name": "Miss Bingley"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [59, 60], "text": "Jane"}, {"position": [128, 130], "text": "his sister"}, {"position": [182, 183], "text": "Jane"}, {"position": [241, 242], "text": "Jane"}, {"position": [270, 272], "text": "one sister"}, {"position": [321, 322], "text": "Jane"}, {"position": [325, 326], "text": "she"}, {"position": [327, 328], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [348, 349], "text": "She"}, {"position": [363, 364], "text": "her"}, {"position": [396, 397], "text": "her"}, {"position": [443, 444], "text": "her"}, {"position": [479, 480], "text": "her"}, {"position": [518, 519], "text": "Jane"}, {"position": [604, 605], "text": "Jane"}, {"position": [668, 669], "text": "Jane"}], "name": "Jane"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [49, 50], "text": "Netherfield"}, {"position": [203, 204], "text": "Netherfield"}, {"position": [344, 345], "text": "Netherfield"}], "name": "Netherfield"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [612, 614], "text": "their father"}, {"position": [619, 620], "text": "his"}, {"position": [631, 632], "text": "he"}], "name": "their father"}]}
