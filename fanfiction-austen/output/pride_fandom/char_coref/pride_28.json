{"document": "XXVIII . Every object in the next day \u2019s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side . Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . At length the Parsonage was discernible . The garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , everything declared they were arriving . Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party . In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . She saw instantly that her cousin \u2019s manners were not altered by his marriage : his formal civility was just what it had been ; and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family . They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time , with ostentatious formality , to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife \u2019s offers of refreshment . Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect , and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . But though everything seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend , that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion . When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not seldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey , and of all that had happened in London , Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind . He could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump . But of all the views which his garden , or which the country or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . From his garden , Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows ; but the ladies , not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband \u2019s help . It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency , of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . When Mr. Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte \u2019s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr. Collins joining in , observed,-- \u201c Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her Ladyship \u2019s carriage is regularly ordered for us . I _ should _ say , one of her Ladyship \u2019s carriages , for she has several . \u201d \u201c Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , \u201d added Charlotte , \u201c and a most attentive neighbour . \u201d \u201c Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . \u201d The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth , in the solitude of her chamber , had to meditate upon Charlotte \u2019s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with , her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenour of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings . A lively imagination soon settled it all . About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and , after listening a moment , she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing - place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out,-- [ Illustration : \u201c In Conversation with the ladies \u201d [ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . ] ] \u201c Oh , my dear Eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! I will not tell you what it is . Make haste , and come down this moment . \u201d Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more ; and down they ran into the dining - room which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies , stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . \u201c And is this all ? \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! \u201d \u201c La ! my dear , \u201d said Maria , quite shocked at the mistake , \u201c it is not Lady Catherine . The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson , who lives with them . The other is Miss De Bourgh . Only look at her . She is quite a little creature . Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! \u201d \u201c She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . Why does she not come in ? \u201d \u201c Oh , Charlotte says she hardly ever does . It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . \u201d \u201c I like her appearance , \u201d said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . \u201c She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . She will make him a very proper wife . \u201d Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth \u2019s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day .
