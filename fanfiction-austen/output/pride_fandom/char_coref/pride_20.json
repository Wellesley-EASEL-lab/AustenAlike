{"document": "XX . Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs. Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . This information , however , startled Mrs. Bennet : she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so . \u201c But depend upon it , Mr. Collins , \u201d she added , \u201c that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . I will speak to her about it myself directly . She is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will _ make _ her know it . \u201d \u201c Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , \u201d cried Mr. Collins ; \u201c but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . If , therefore , she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because , if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . \u201d \u201c Sir , you quite misunderstand me , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , alarmed . \u201c Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . In everything else she is as good - natured a girl as ever lived . I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . \u201d She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out , as she entered the library,-- \u201c Oh , Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . \u201d Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern , which was not in the least altered by her communication . \u201c I have not the pleasure of understanding you , \u201d said he , when she had finished her speech . \u201c Of what are you talking ? \u201d \u201c Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy . Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . \u201d \u201c And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems a hopeless business . \u201d \u201c Speak to Lizzy about it yourself . Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . \u201d \u201c Let her be called down . She shall hear my opinion . \u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . \u201c Come here , child , \u201d cried her father as she appeared . \u201c I have sent for you on an affair of importance . I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage . Is it true ? \u201d Elizabeth replied that it was . \u201c Very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ? \u201d \u201c I have , sir . \u201d \u201c Very well . We now come to the point . Your mother insists upon your accepting it . Is it not so , Mrs. Bennet ? \u201d \u201c Yes , or I will never see her again . \u201d \u201c An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do _ not _ marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you _ do _ . \u201d Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs. Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . \u201c What do you mean , Mr. Bennet , by talking in this way ? You promised me to _ insist _ upon her marrying him . \u201d \u201c My dear , \u201d replied her husband , \u201c I have two small favours to request . First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and , secondly , of my room . I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . \u201d Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs. Bennet give up the point . She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns . She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane , with all possible mildness , declined interfering ; and Elizabeth , sometimes with real earnestness , and sometimes with playful gaiety , replied to her attacks . Though her manner varied , however , her determination never did . Mr. Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother \u2019s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , \u201c I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c they entered the breakfast room \u201d ] Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news ; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where Mrs. Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family . \u201c Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , \u201d she added , in a melancholy tone ; \u201c for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me ; I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . \u201d Charlotte \u2019s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . \u201c Ay , there she comes , \u201d continued Mrs. Bennet , \u201c looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . _ I _ shall not be able to keep you -- and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . Those who do not complain are never pitied . \u201d Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation . She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls,-- \u201c Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together . \u201d Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation:-- \u201c Oh , Mr. Collins ! \u201d \u201c My dear madam , \u201d replied he , \u201c let us be for ever silent on this point . Far be it from me , \u201d he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , \u201c to resent the behaviour of your daughter . Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all : the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been , in early preferment ; and , I trust , I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed , that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter \u2019s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter \u2019s lips instead of your own ; but we are all liable to error . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family ; and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologize . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 4], "text": "Mr. Collins"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "his"}, {"position": [64, 65], "text": "him"}, {"position": [79, 81],
