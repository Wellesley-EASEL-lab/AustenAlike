{"document": "XLI . The first week of their return was soon gone . The second began . It was the last of the regiment \u2019s stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace . The dejection was almost universal . The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family . \u201c Good Heaven ! What is to become of us ? What are we to do ? \u201d would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe . \u201c How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? \u201d Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five - and - twenty years ago . \u201c I am sure , \u201d said she , \u201c I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller \u2019s regiment went away . I thought I should have broke my heart . \u201d \u201c I am sure I shall break _ mine _ , \u201d said Lydia . \u201c If one could but go to Brighton ! \u201d observed Mrs. Bennet . \u201c Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton ! But papa is so disagreeable . \u201d \u201c A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . \u201d \u201c And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good , \u201d added Kitty . Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House . Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy \u2019s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . But the gloom of Lydia \u2019s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . A resemblance in good - humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their _ three _ months \u2019 acquaintance they had been intimate _ two _ . The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs. Forster , the delight of Mrs. Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described . Wholly inattentive to her sister \u2019s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone \u2019s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . \u201c I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , \u201d said she , \u201c though I am _ not _ her particular friend . I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . \u201d In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her , were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia \u2019s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . He heard her attentively , and then said,-- \u201c Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . \u201d \u201c If you were aware , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia \u2019s unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . \u201d \u201c Already arisen ! \u201d repeated Mr. Bennet . \u201c What ! has she frightened away some of your lovers ? Poor little Lizzy ! But do not be cast down . Such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia \u2019s folly . \u201d \u201c Indeed , you are mistaken . I have no such injuries to resent . It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia \u2019s character . Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . Her character will be fixed ; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . She will follow wherever Lydia leads . Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! Oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? \u201d Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and , affectionately taking her hand , said , in reply,-- \u201c Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say , three -- very silly sisters . We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . Let her go , then . Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . The officers will find women better worth their notice . Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . \u201d With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations by dwelling on them . She was confident of having performed her duty ; and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility . In Lydia \u2019s imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness . She saw , with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing - place covered with officers . She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown . She saw all the glories of the camp : its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and , to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . Lydia \u2019s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband \u2019s never intending to go there himself . But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued , with little intermission , to the very day of Lydia \u2019s leaving home . Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time . Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so . She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure ; for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured , at any time , by their renewal . On the very last day of the regiment \u2019s remaining in Meryton , he dined , with others of the officers , at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good - humour , that , on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam \u2019s and Mr. Darcy \u2019s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but , with a moment \u2019s recollection , and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him . Her answer was warmly in his favour . With an air of indifference , he soon afterwards added , \u201c How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? \u201d \u201c Nearly three weeks . \u201d \u201c And you saw him frequently ? \u201d \u201c Yes , almost every day . \u201d \u201c His manners are very different from his cousin \u2019s . \u201d \u201c Yes , very different ; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . \u201d \u201c Indeed ! \u201d cried Wickham , with a look which did not escape her . \u201c And pray may I ask-- \u201d but checking himself , he added , in a gayer tone , \u201c Is it in address that he improves ? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style ? for I dare not hope , \u201d he continued , in a lower and more serious tone , \u201c that he is improved in essentials . \u201d \u201c Oh , no ! \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . \u201d While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning . There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added,-- \u201c When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . \u201d Wickham \u2019s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents,-- \u201c You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . \u201d Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . The rest of the evening passed with the _ appearance _ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . Kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy . Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and , in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [46, 50], "text": "The elder Miss Bennets"}], "name": "The elder Miss Bennets"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [82, 83], "text": "Lydia"}, {"position":
