{"document": "XXXI . Colonel Fitzwilliam \u2019s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen \u2019s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church . The invitation was accepted , of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine \u2019s drawing - room . Her Ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them : anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs. Collins \u2019s pretty friend had , moreover , caught his fancy very much . He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy . _ His _ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her Ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out,-- \u201c What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? What is it you are talking of ? What are you telling Miss Bennet ? Let me hear what it is . \u201d \u201c We were talking of music , madam , \u201d said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . \u201c Of music ! Then pray speak aloud . It is of all subjects my delight . I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? \u201d Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister \u2019s proficiency . \u201c I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , \u201d said Lady Catherine ; \u201c and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . \u201d \u201c I assure you , madam , \u201d he replied , \u201c that she does not need such advice . She practises very constantly . \u201d \u201c So much the better . It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson \u2019s room . She would be in nobody \u2019s way , you know , in that part of the house . \u201d Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt \u2019s ill - breeding , and made no answer . When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . He drew a chair near her . Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer \u2019s countenance . Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile , and said,-- \u201c You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me . But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well . There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . \u201d \u201c I shall not say that you are mistaken , \u201d he replied , \u201c because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . \u201d Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , \u201c Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . \u201d \u201c I am not afraid of you , \u201d said he , smilingly . \u201c Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , \u201d cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . \u201c I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . \u201d \u201c You shall hear , then -- but prepare for something very dreadful . The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? He danced only four dances ! I am sorry to pain you , but so it was . He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact . \u201d \u201c I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . \u201d \u201c True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball - room . Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? My fingers wait your orders . \u201d \u201c Perhaps , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c I should have judged better had I sought an introduction , but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . \u201d \u201c Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? \u201d said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . \u201c Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill - qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? \u201d \u201c I can answer your question , \u201d said Fitzwilliam , \u201c without applying to him . It is because he will not give himself the trouble . \u201d \u201c I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . \u201d \u201c My fingers , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women \u2019s do . They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman \u2019s of superior execution . \u201d Darcy smiled and said , \u201c You are perfectly right . You have employed your time much better . No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . We neither of us perform to strangers . \u201d Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . Elizabeth immediately began playing again . Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy,-- \u201c Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne \u2019s . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . \u201d Elizabeth looked at Darcy , to see how cordially he assented to his cousin \u2019s praise : but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _ her _ , had she been his relation . Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth \u2019s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste . Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship \u2019s carriage was ready to take them all home .",
