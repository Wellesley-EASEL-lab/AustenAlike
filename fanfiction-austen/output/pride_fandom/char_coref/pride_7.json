{"document": "VII . Mr. Bennet \u2019s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed , in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother \u2019s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips , who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt , and to a milliner \u2019s shop just over the way . The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions : their minds were more vacant than their sisters \u2019 , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and , however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head - quarters . Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence . Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers \u2019 names and connections . Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . Mr. Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr. Bingley \u2019s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign . After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr. Bennet coolly observed,-- \u201c From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . \u201d Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . \u201c I am astonished , my dear , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , \u201c that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . If I wished to think slightingly of anybody \u2019s children , it should not be of my own , however . \u201d \u201c If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . \u201d \u201c Yes ; but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . \u201d \u201c This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . \u201d \u201c My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William \u2019s in his regimentals . \u201d \u201c Mamma , \u201d cried Lydia , \u201c my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson \u2019s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke \u2019s library . \u201d Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . Mrs. Bennet \u2019s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read,-- \u201c Well , Jane , who is it from ? What is it about ? What does he say ? Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . \u201d \u201c It is from Miss Bingley , \u201d said Jane , and then read it aloud . / * NIND \u201c My dear friend , * / \u201c If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives ; for a whole day \u2019s _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ between two women can never end without a quarrel . Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . Yours ever , \u201c CAROLINE BINGLEY . \u201d \u201c With the officers ! \u201d cried Lydia : \u201c I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . \u201d \u201c Dining out , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet ; \u201c that is very unlucky . \u201d \u201c Can I have the carriage ? \u201d said Jane . \u201c No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . \u201d \u201c That would be a good scheme , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . \u201d \u201c Oh , but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley \u2019s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . \u201d \u201c I had much rather go in the coach . \u201d \u201c But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are not they ? \u201d \u201c They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . \u201d \u201c But if you have got them to - day , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c my mother \u2019s purpose will be answered . \u201d She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged ; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day . Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard . Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . \u201c This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:-- / * NIND \u201c My dearest Lizzie , * / \u201c I find myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me . \u201c Yours , etc . \u201d \u201c Well , my dear , \u201d said Mr. Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , \u201c if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . \u201d \u201c Oh , I am not at all afraid of her dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . She will be taken good care of . As long as she stays there , it is all very well . I would go and see her if I could have the carriage . \u201d Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had : and as she was no horsewoman , walking was her only alternative . She declared her resolution . \u201c How can you be so silly , \u201d cried her mother , \u201c as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . \u201d \u201c I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want . \u201d \u201c Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , \u201d said her father , \u201c to send for the horses ? \u201d \u201c No , indeed . I do not wish to avoid the walk . The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . I shall be back by dinner . \u201d \u201c I admire the activity of your benevolence , \u201d observed Mary , \u201c but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . \u201d \u201c We will go as far as Meryton with you , \u201d said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . \u201c If we make haste , \u201d said Lydia , as they walked along , \u201c perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter , before he goes . \u201d In Meryton they parted : the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers \u2019 wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles , with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . She was shown into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother \u2019s manners there was something better than politeness -- there was good - humour and kindness . Mr. Darcy said very little , and Mr. Hurst nothing at all . The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion \u2019s justifying her coming so far alone . The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish , and not well enough to leave her room . Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . She was not equal , however , to much conversation ; and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . Elizabeth silently attended her . When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane . The apothecary came ; and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely . Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go , and very unwillingly said so . Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was despatched to Longbourn , to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .
