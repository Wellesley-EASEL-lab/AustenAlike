{"document": "XLVII . \u201c I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , \u201d said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; \u201c and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his Colonel \u2019s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? His temptation is not adequate to the risk . \u201d \u201c Do you really think so ? \u201d cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . \u201c Upon my word , \u201d said Mrs. Gardiner , \u201c I begin to be of your uncle \u2019s opinion . It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . I can not think so very ill of Wickham . Can you , yourself , Lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? \u201d \u201c Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it . Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? \u201d \u201c In the first place , \u201d replied Mr. Gardiner , \u201c there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . \u201d \u201c Oh , but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . \u201d \u201c Well , then,--supposing them to be in London -- they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . \u201d \u201c But why all this secrecy ? Why any fear of detection ? Why must their marriage be private ? Oh , no , no -- this is not likely . His most particular friend , you see by Jane \u2019s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . He can not afford it . And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father \u2019s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . \u201d \u201c But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? \u201d \u201c It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , \u201d replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , \u201c that a sister \u2019s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . \u201d \u201c But you see that Jane , \u201d said her aunt , \u201c does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . \u201d \u201c Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . \u201d \u201c And do you really know all this ? \u201d cried Mrs. Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . \u201c I do , indeed , \u201d replied Elizabeth , colouring . \u201c I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . Yet he knew to the contrary himself . He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . \u201d \u201c But does Lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? \u201d \u201c Oh , yes!--that , that is the worst of all . Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . And when I returned home the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight \u2019s time . As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . That _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . That such a consequence as _ this _ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . \u201d \u201c When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? \u201d \u201c Not the slightest . I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . \u201d It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . From Elizabeth \u2019s thoughts it was never absent . Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self - reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness . They travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day . It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations . The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . Elizabeth jumped out ; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running downstairs from her mother \u2019s apartment , immediately met her . Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives . \u201c Not yet , \u201d replied Jane . \u201c But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . \u201d \u201c Is my father in town ? \u201d \u201c Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . \u201d \u201c And have you heard from him often ? \u201d \u201c We have heard only once . He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . \u201d \u201c And my mother -- how is she ? How are you all ? \u201d \u201c My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . She is upstairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . She does not yet leave her dressing - room . Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well . \u201d \u201c But you -- how are you ? \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c You look pale . How much you must have gone through ! \u201d Her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party . Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . When they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce the marriage . Mrs. Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes \u2019 conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill - usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill - judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . \u201c If I had been able , \u201d said she , \u201c to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . Poor , dear child ! And now here \u2019s Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . \u201d They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . \u201c Do not give way to useless alarm , \u201d added he : \u201c though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . In a few days more , we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . \u201d \u201c Oh , my dear brother , \u201d replied Mrs. Bennet , \u201c that is exactly what I could most wish for . And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry . And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . And , above all things , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting . Tell him what a dreadful state I am in -- that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . \u201d But Mr. Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters . Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it ; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _ one _ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before . One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty . As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table,-- \u201c This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . \u201d Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , \u201c Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . \u201d Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject by saying , \u201c But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard . Give me further particulars . What did Colonel Forster say ? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? They must have seen them together for ever . \u201d \u201c Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia \u2019s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . I am so grieved for him . His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . He _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . \u201d \u201c And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? Did he know of their intending to go off ? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; but when questioned by _ him _ , Denny denied knowing anything of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying , and from _ that _ I am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before . \u201d \u201c And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? \u201d \u201c How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ? I felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister \u2019s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . My father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia \u2019s last letter she had prepared her for such a step . She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other many weeks . \u201d \u201c But not before they went to Brighton ? \u201d \u201c No , I believe not . \u201d \u201c And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? Does he know his real character ? \u201d \u201c I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt : but I hope this may be false . \u201d \u201c Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! \u201d \u201c Perhaps it would have been better , \u201d replied her sister . \u201c But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . \u201d \u201c We acted with the best intentions . \u201d \u201c Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia \u2019s note to his wife ? \u201d \u201c He brought it with him for us to see . \u201d Jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to Elizabeth . These were the contents:-- / * NIND \u201c My dear Harriet , * / \u201c You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I can not help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . I am going to Gretna Green , and if you can not guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . What a good joke it will be ! I can hardly write for laughing . Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure . I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . Good - bye . Give my love to Colonel Forster . I hope you will drink to our good journey . \u201c Your affectionate friend , \u201c LYDIA BENNET . \u201d \u201c Oh , thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! \u201d cried Elizabeth when she had finished it . \u201c What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment ! But at least it shows that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy . My poor father ! how he must have felt it ! \u201d \u201c I never saw anyone so shocked . He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! \u201d \u201c Oh , Jane , \u201d cried Elizabeth , \u201c was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? \u201d \u201c I do not know : I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult . My mother was in hysterics ; and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done . But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . \u201d \u201c Your attendance upon her has been too much for you . You do not look well . Oh that I had been with you ! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . \u201d \u201c Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . She was of great use and comfort to us all , and Lady Lucas has been very kind : she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . \u201d \u201c She had better have stayed at home , \u201d cried Elizabeth : \u201c perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one \u2019s neighbours . Assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable . Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . \u201d She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . \u201c He meant , I believe , \u201d replied Jane , \u201c to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if anything could be made out from them . His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady \u2019s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked , he meant to make inquiries at Clapham . If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . I do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .
