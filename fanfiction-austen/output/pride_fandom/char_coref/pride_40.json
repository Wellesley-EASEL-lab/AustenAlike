{"document": "XL . Elizabeth \u2019s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself . Miss Bennet \u2019s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister \u2019s refusal must have given him . \u201c His being so sure of succeeding was wrong , \u201d said she , \u201c and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . \u201d \u201c Indeed , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? \u201d \u201c Blame you ! Oh , no . \u201d \u201c But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham ? \u201d \u201c No -- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . \u201d \u201c But you _ will _ know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . \u201d She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . What a stroke was this for poor Jane , who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual ! Nor was Darcy \u2019s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . \u201c This will not do , \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy \u2019s , but you shall do as you choose . \u201d It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane . \u201c I do not know when I have been more shocked , \u201d said she . \u201c Wickham so very bad ! It is almost past belief . And poor Mr. Darcy ! dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . Such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! It is really too distressing , I am sure you must feel it so . \u201d \u201c Oh no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . \u201d \u201c Poor Wickham ! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner . \u201d \u201c There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . \u201d \u201c I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _ appearance _ of it as you used to do . \u201d \u201c And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . It is such a spur to one \u2019s genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . One may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . \u201d \u201c Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . \u201d \u201c Indeed , I could not . I was uncomfortable enough , I was very uncomfortable -- I may say unhappy . And with no one to speak to of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me , and say that I had not been so very weak , and vain , and nonsensical , as I knew I had ! Oh , how I wanted you ! \u201d \u201c How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy , for now they _ do _ appear wholly undeserved . \u201d \u201c Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham \u2019s character . \u201d Miss Bennet paused a little , and then replied , \u201c Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your own opinion ? \u201d \u201c That it ought not to be attempted . Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public . On the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . I am not equal to it . Wickham will soon be gone ; and , therefore , it will not signify to anybody here what he really is . Some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . At present I will say nothing about it . \u201d \u201c You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . We must not make him desperate . \u201d The tumult of Elizabeth \u2019s mind was allayed by this conversation . She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbade the disclosure . She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy \u2019s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery . \u201c And then , \u201d said she , \u201c if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . The liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! \u201d She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister \u2019s spirits . Jane was not happy . She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . \u201c Well , Lizzy , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , one day , \u201c what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of Jane \u2019s ? For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . I told my sister Philips so the other day . But I can not find out that Jane saw anything of him in London . Well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . \u201d \u201c I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . \u201d \u201c Oh , well ! it is just as he chooses . Nobody wants him to come ; though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and , if I was her , I would not have put up with it . Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . \u201d But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer . \u201c Well , Lizzy , \u201d continued her mother , soon afterwards , \u201c and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? Well , well , I only hope it will last . And what sort of table do they keep ? Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say . If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . There is nothing extravagant in _ their _ housekeeping , I dare say . \u201d \u201c No , nothing at all . \u201d \u201c A great deal of good management , depend upon it . Yes , yes . _ They _ will take care not to outrun their income . _ They _ will never be distressed for money . Well , much good may it do them ! And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . \u201d \u201c It was a subject which they could not mention before me . \u201d \u201c No ; it would have been strange if they had . But I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves . Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . _ I _ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions":
