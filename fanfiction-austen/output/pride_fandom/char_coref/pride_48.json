{"document": "XLVIII . The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . His family knew him to be , on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent ; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion . They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send ; but even of _ that _ they would have been glad to be certain . Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on ; and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband \u2019s not being killed in a duel . Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces . She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet , and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom . Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up -- though , as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham \u2019s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them . All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman \u2019s family . Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness . Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister \u2019s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when , if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him : it told them , that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street . That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure ; but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . He added , that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . There was also a postscript to this effect:-- \u201c I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man \u2019s intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . If there were anyone that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person . \u201d Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved . She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information ; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning \u2019s impatience . Through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated ; and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr. Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . It was as follows:-- / * \u201c My dear Sir , * / \u201c I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be , of all others , most afflicting to a parent \u2019s mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others : for who , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? And this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . Let me advise you , then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . \u201c I am , dear sir , \u201d etc . , etc . Mr. Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . There was no one , therefore , who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him . And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia \u2019s relations ; for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount . Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton . He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . \u201c A gamester ! \u201d she cried . \u201c This is wholly unexpected ; I had not an idea of it . \u201d Mr. Gardiner added , in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . Rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother - in - law \u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . When Mrs. Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . \u201c What ! is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ? \u201d she cried . \u201c Sure he will not leave London before he has found them . Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? \u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it . The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _ that_,--though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia \u2019s infamy somewhat better . It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two . When Mr. Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure . He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away ; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , \u201c Say nothing of that . Who should suffer but myself ? It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . \u201d \u201c You must not be too severe upon yourself , \u201d replied Elizabeth . \u201c You may well warn me against such an evil . Human nature is so prone to fall into it ! No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . It will pass away soon enough . \u201d \u201c Do you suppose them to be in London ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? \u201d \u201c And Lydia used to want to go to London , \u201d added Kitty . \u201c She is happy , then , \u201d said her father , drily ; \u201c and her residence there will probably be of some duration . \u201d Then , after a short silence , he continued , \u201c Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . \u201d They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother \u2019s tea . \u201c This is a parade , \u201d cried he , \u201c which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away . \u201d \u201c I am not going to run away , papa , \u201d said Kitty , fretfully . \u201c If _ I _ should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . \u201d \u201c _ You _ go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne , for fifty pounds ! No , Kitty , I have at least learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . \u201d Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry . \u201c Well , well , \u201d said he , \u201c do not make yourself unhappy . If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [12, 14], "text": "Mr. Bennet"}, {"position": [29,
