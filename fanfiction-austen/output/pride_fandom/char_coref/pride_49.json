{"document": "XLIX . Two days after Mr. Bennet \u2019s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , \u201c I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . \u201d \u201c What do you mean , Hill ? We have heard nothing from town . \u201d \u201c Dear madam , \u201d cried Mrs. Hill , in great astonishment , \u201c do n\u2019t you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner ? He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . \u201d Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast - room ; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said,-- \u201c If you are looking for my master , ma\u2019am , he is walking towards the little copse . \u201d Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out,-- \u201c Oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? \u201d \u201c Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . \u201d \u201c Well , and what news does it bring -- good or bad ? \u201d \u201c What is there of good to be expected ? \u201d said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; \u201c but perhaps you would like to read it . \u201d Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . Jane now came up . \u201c Read it aloud , \u201d said their father , \u201c for I hardly know myself what it is about . \u201d / * RIGHT \u201c Gracechurch Street , _ Monday , August 2 _ . * / \u201c My dear Brother , \u201c At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . The particulars I reserve till we meet . It is enough to know they are discovered : I have seen them both---- \u201d \u201c Then it is as I always hoped , \u201d cried Jane : \u201c they are married ! \u201d Elizabeth read on : \u201c I have seen them both . They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . These are conditions which , considering everything , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham \u2019s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . She comes to us to - day . I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . Yours , etc . \u201c EDW . GARDINER . \u201d \u201c Is it possible ? \u201d cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . \u201c Can it be possible that he will marry her ? \u201d \u201c Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , \u201d said her sister . \u201c My dear father , I congratulate you . \u201d \u201c And have you answered the letter ? \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c No ; but it must be done soon . \u201d Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . \u201c Oh ! my dear father , \u201d she cried , \u201c come back and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is in such a case . \u201d \u201c Let me write for you , \u201d said Jane , \u201c if you dislike the trouble yourself . \u201d \u201c I dislike it very much , \u201d he replied ; \u201c but it must be done . \u201d And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . \u201c And -- may I ask ? \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . \u201d \u201c Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . \u201d \u201c And they _ must _ marry ! Yet he is _ such _ a man . \u201d \u201c Yes , yes , they must marry . There is nothing else to be done . But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . \u201d \u201c Money ! my uncle ! \u201d cried Jane , \u201c what do you mean , sir ? \u201d \u201c I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . \u201d \u201c That is very true , \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh , it must be my uncle \u2019s doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said her father . \u201c Wickham \u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds : I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . \u201d \u201c Ten thousand pounds ! Heaven forbid ! How is half such a sum to be repaid ? \u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer ; and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast - room . \u201c And they are really to be married ! \u201d cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . \u201c How strange this is ! and for _ this _ we are to be thankful . That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! Oh , Lydia ! \u201d \u201c I comfort myself with thinking , \u201d replied Jane , \u201c that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . He has children of his own , and may have more . How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? \u201d \u201c If we are ever able to learn what Wickham \u2019s debts have been , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! \u201d \u201c We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , \u201d said Jane : \u201c I hope and trust they will yet be happy . His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . \u201d \u201c Their conduct has been such , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c as neither you , nor I , nor anybody , can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it . \u201d It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied,-- \u201c Just as you please . \u201d \u201c May we take my uncle \u2019s letter to read to her ? \u201d \u201c Take whatever you like , and get away . \u201d Elizabeth took the letter from his writing - table , and they went upstairs together . Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all . After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud . Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself . As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner \u2019s hope of Lydia \u2019s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance . She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation . To know that her daughter would be married was enough . She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . \u201c My dear , dear Lydia ! \u201d she cried : \u201c this is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything . How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . Stay , stay , I will go myself . Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill . I will put on my things in a moment . My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! \u201d Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner \u2019s behaviour laid them all under . \u201c For we must attribute this happy conclusion , \u201d she added , \u201c in a great measure to his kindness . We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . \u201d \u201c Well , \u201d cried her mother , \u201c it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents . Well ! I am so happy . In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . Mrs. Wickham ! How well it sounds ! And she was only sixteen last June . My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I ca n\u2019t write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me . We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . \u201d She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted . One day \u2019s delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual . Other schemes , too , came into her head . \u201c I will go to Meryton , \u201d said she , \u201c as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . Kitty , run down and order the carriage . An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ? Oh ! here comes Hill . My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . \u201d Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy . Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . Poor Lydia \u2019s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness , nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [26, 28], "text": "the housekeeper"}, {"position": [35, 36], "text": "she"}, {"position":
