{"document": "IX . Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister \u2019s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . The note was immediately despatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . Mrs. Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . She would not listen , therefore , to her daughter \u2019s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley \u2019s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected . \u201c Indeed I have , sir , \u201d was her answer . \u201c She is a great deal too ill to be moved . Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her . We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . \u201d \u201c Removed ! \u201d cried Bingley . \u201c It must not be thought of . My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . \u201d \u201c You may depend upon it , madam , \u201d said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , \u201c that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . \u201d Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments . \u201c I am sure , \u201d she added , \u201c if it was not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with . I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _ her _ . You have a sweet room here , Mr. Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . \u201d \u201c Whatever I do is done in a hurry , \u201d replied he ; \u201c and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . \u201d \u201c That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c You begin to comprehend me , do you ? \u201d cried he , turning towards her . \u201c Oh yes -- I understand you perfectly . \u201d \u201c I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through , I am afraid , is pitiful . \u201d \u201c That is as it happens . It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . \u201d \u201c Lizzy , \u201d cried her mother , \u201c remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . \u201d \u201c I did not know before , \u201d continued Bingley , immediately , \u201c that you were a studier of character . It must be an amusing study . \u201d \u201c Yes ; but intricate characters are the _ most _ amusing . They have at least that advantage . \u201d \u201c The country , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . \u201d \u201c But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . \u201d \u201c Yes , indeed , \u201d cried Mrs. Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . \u201c I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . \u201d Everybody was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . Mrs. Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph,-- \u201c I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr. Bingley ? \u201d \u201c When I am in the country , \u201d he replied , \u201c I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town , it is pretty much the same . They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . \u201d \u201c Ay , that is because you have the right disposition . But that gentleman , \u201d looking at Darcy , \u201c seemed to think the country was nothing at all . \u201d \u201c Indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , \u201d said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother . \u201c You quite mistook Mr. Darcy . He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . \u201d \u201c Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . I know we dine with four - and - twenty families . \u201d Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance . His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile . Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother \u2019s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _ her _ coming away . \u201c Yes , she called yesterday with her father . What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr. Bingley -- is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to everybody . _ That _ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter . \u201d \u201c Did Charlotte dine with you ? \u201d \u201c No , she would go home . I fancy she was wanted about the mince - pies . For my part , Mr. Bingley , _ I _ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _ my _ daughters are brought up differently . But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you . It is a pity they are not handsome ! Not that _ I _ think Charlotte so _ very _ plain ; but then she is our particular friend . \u201d \u201c She seems a very pleasant young woman , \u201d said Bingley . \u201c Oh dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane \u2019s beauty . I do not like to boast of my own child ; but to be sure , Jane -- one does not often see anybody better looking . It is what everybody says . I do not trust my own partiality . When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner \u2019s in town so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . But , however , he did not . Perhaps he thought her too young . However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . \u201d \u201c And so ended his affection , \u201d said Elizabeth , impatiently . \u201c There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! \u201d \u201c I have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love , \u201d said Darcy . \u201c Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . Everything nourishes what is strong already . But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . \u201d Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again . She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy . Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . She performed her part , indeed , without much graciousness , but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit ; and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . Lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . She had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle \u2019s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . She was very equal , therefore , to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother \u2019s ear . \u201c I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ? \u201d Lydia declared herself satisfied . \u201c Oh yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well ; and by that time , most likely , Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . And when you have given _ your _ ball , \u201d she added , \u201c I shall insist on their giving one also . I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . \u201d Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations \u2019 behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _ her _ , in spite of all Miss Bingley \u2019s witticisms on _ fine eyes _ .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [10, 11], "text": "her"}, {"position": [34, 35], "text": "she"}, {"position": [68,
