{"document": "LV . A few days after this visit , Mr. Bingley called again , and alone . His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days \u2019 time . He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . \u201c Next time you call , \u201d said she , \u201c I hope we shall be more lucky . \u201d He should be particularly happy at any time , etc . , etc . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . \u201c Can you come to - morrow ? \u201d Yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters \u2019 room , in her dressing - gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out,-- \u201c My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come . He is , indeed . Make haste , make haste . Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . Never mind Miss Lizzy \u2019s hair . \u201d \u201c We will be down as soon as we can , \u201d said Jane ; \u201c but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago . \u201d \u201c Oh ! hang Kitty ! what has she to do with it ? Come , be quick , be quick ! where is your sash , my dear ? \u201d But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening . After tea , Mr. Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went upstairs to her instrument . Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , \u201c What is the matter , mamma ? What do you keep winking at me for ? What am I to do ? \u201d \u201c Nothing , child , nothing . I did not wink at you . \u201d She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty,-- \u201c Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , \u201d took her out of the room . Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that _ she _ would not give in to it . In a few minutes , Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,-- \u201c Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . \u201d Elizabeth was forced to go . \u201c We may as well leave them by themselves , you know , \u201d said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . \u201c Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . \u201d Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room . Mrs. Bennet \u2019s schemes for this day were ineffectual . Bingley was everything that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter . He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet \u2019s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time . Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman \u2019s concurrence . Bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him . Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet \u2019s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter . Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast - room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother \u2019s schemes . But on her returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all . _ Their _ situation was awkward enough ; but _ hers _ she thought was still worse . Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and , whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and , instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . \u201c \u2019 Tis too much ! \u201d she added , \u201c by far too much . I do not deserve it . Oh , why is not everybody as happy ? \u201d Elizabeth \u2019s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . \u201c I must go instantly to my mother , \u201d she cried . \u201c I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude , or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself . He is gone to my father already . Oh , Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall I bear so much happiness ? \u201d She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card - party , and was sitting upstairs with Kitty . Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . \u201c And this , \u201d said she , \u201c is the end of all his friend \u2019s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister \u2019s falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , and most reasonable end ! \u201d In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . \u201c Where is your sister ? \u201d said he hastily , as he opened the door . \u201c With my mother upstairs . She will be down in a moment , I dare say . \u201d He then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of Jane \u2019s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet \u2019s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was . Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said,-- \u201c Jane , I congratulate you . You will be a very happy woman . \u201d Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . \u201c You are a good girl , \u201d he replied , \u201c and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . Your tempers are by no means unlike . You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . \u201d \u201c I hope not so . Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _ me _ . \u201d \u201c Exceed their income ! My dear Mr. Bennet , \u201d cried his wife , \u201c what are you talking of ? Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . \u201d Then addressing her daughter , \u201c Oh , my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! I am sure I sha n\u2019t get a wink of sleep all night . I knew how it would be . I always said it must be so , at last . I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . Oh , he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! \u201d Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten . Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . At that moment she cared for no other . Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense . Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else : but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . \u201c He has made me so happy , \u201d said she , one evening , \u201c by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! I had not believed it possible . \u201d \u201c I suspected as much , \u201d replied Elizabeth . \u201c But how did he account for it ? \u201d \u201c It must have been his sisters \u2019 doing . They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . \u201d \u201c That is the most unforgiving speech , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c that I ever heard you utter . Good girl ! It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley \u2019s pretended regard . \u201d \u201c Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? \u201d \u201c He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . \u201d This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . \u201c I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! \u201d cried Jane . \u201c Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy ! If there were but such another man for you ! \u201d \u201c If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you . Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time . \u201d The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton . The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world ; though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 11], "text": "Mr. Bingley"}, {"position": [17, 18], "text": "His"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text": "him"}, {"position": [38, 39], "text":
