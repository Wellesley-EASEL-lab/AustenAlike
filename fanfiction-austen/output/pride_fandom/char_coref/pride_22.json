{"document": "XXII . The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases ; and again , during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins . Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . \u201c It keeps him in good humour , \u201d said she , \u201c and I am more obliged to you than I can express . \u201d Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . This was very amiable ; but Charlotte \u2019s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins \u2019s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . Such was Miss Lucas \u2019s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable , that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character ; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet . He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that , if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for , though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday . His reception , however , was of the most flattering kind . Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . In as short a time as Mr. Collins \u2019s long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . Mr. Collins \u2019s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . Lady Lucas began directly to calculate , with more interest than the matter had ever [ Illustration : \u201c So much love and eloquence \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] excited before , how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James \u2019s . The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion . The younger girls formed hopes of _ coming out _ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte \u2019s dying an old maid . Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . Her reflections were in general satisfactory . Mr. Collins , to be sure , was neither sensible nor agreeable : his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object : it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and , however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation . She resolved to give her the information herself ; and therefore charged Mr. Collins , when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs. Bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . \u201c My dear madam , \u201d he replied , \u201c this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . \u201d They were all astonished ; and Mr. Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said,-- \u201c But is there not danger of Lady Catherine \u2019s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . \u201d \u201c My dear sir , \u201d replied Mr. Collins , \u201c I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her Ladyship \u2019s concurrence . \u201d \u201c You can not be too much on your guard . Risk anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _ we _ shall take no offence . \u201d \u201c Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and , depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . \u201d With proper civilities , the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others : there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her ; and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that , if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion . But on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away . Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . The possibility of Mr. Collins \u2019s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two : but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself ; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out,-- \u201c Engaged to Mr. Collins ! my dear Charlotte , impossible ! \u201d The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied,-- \u201c Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman \u2019s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? \u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself ; and , making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her , with tolerable firmness , that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . \u201c I see what you are feeling , \u201d replied Charlotte ; \u201c you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . I am not romantic , you know . I never was . I ask only a comfortable home ; and , considering Mr. Collins \u2019s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . \u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201c undoubtedly ; \u201d and , after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . Charlotte did not stay much longer ; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . The strangeness of Mr. Collins \u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . She had always felt that Charlotte \u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own ; but she could not have supposed it possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage . Charlotte , the wife of Mr. Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself , and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
