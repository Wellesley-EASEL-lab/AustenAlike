{"document": "V. Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate . Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune , and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty . The distinction had , perhaps , been felt too strongly . It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and , quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge ; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . For , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody . By nature inoffensive , friendly , and obliging , his presentation at St. James \u2019s had made him courteous . Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet . They had several children . The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was Elizabeth \u2019s intimate friend . That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . \u201c _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , with civil self - command , to Miss Lucas . \u201c _ You _ were Mr. Bingley \u2019s first choice . \u201d \u201c Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . \u201d \u201c Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice . To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her -- indeed , I rather believe he _ did_--I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . \u201d \u201c Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson : did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson \u2019s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , \u2018 Oh , the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided , indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . \u201d \u201c _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Eliza , \u201d said Charlotte . \u201c Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just _ tolerable _ . \u201d \u201c I beg you will not put it into Lizzy \u2019s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c Without once opening his lips \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] \u201c Are you quite sure , ma\u2019am ? Is not there a little mistake ? \u201d said Jane . \u201c I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . \u201d \u201c Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . \u201d \u201c Miss Bingley told me , \u201d said Jane , \u201c that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . With _ them _ he is remarkably agreeable . \u201d \u201c I do not believe a word of it , my dear . If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long . But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise . \u201d \u201c I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , \u201d said Miss Lucas , \u201c but I wish he had danced with Eliza . \u201d \u201c Another time , Lizzy , \u201d said her mother , \u201c I would not dance with _ him _ , if I were you . \u201d \u201c I believe , ma\u2019am , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . \u201d \u201c His pride , \u201d said Miss Lucas , \u201c does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . One can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . If I may so express it , he has a _ right _ to be proud . \u201d \u201c That is very true , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . \u201d \u201c Pride , \u201d observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , \u201c is a very common failing , I believe . By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . A person may be proud without being vain . Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves ; vanity to what we would have others think of us . \u201d \u201c If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , \u201d cried a young Lucas , who came with his sisters , \u201c I should not care how proud I was . I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . \u201d \u201c Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet ; \u201c and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . \u201d The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would ; and the argument ended only with the visit .",
