{"document": "XXXIII . More than once did Elizabeth , in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and , to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him , at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers . How it could occur a second time , therefore , was very odd ! Yet it did , and even the third . It seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance ; for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins \u2019s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings , and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _ there _ too . His words seemed to imply it . Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? She supposed , if he meant anything , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . She was engaged one day , as she walked , in re - perusing Jane \u2019s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy , she saw , on looking up , that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . Putting away the letter immediately , and forcing a smile , she said,-- \u201c I did not know before that you ever walked this way . \u201d \u201c I have been making the tour of the park , \u201d he replied , \u201c as I generally do every year , and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage . Are you going much farther ? \u201d \u201c No , I should have turned in a moment . \u201d And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together . \u201c Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? \u201d said she . \u201c Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again . But I am at his disposal . He arranges the business just as he pleases . \u201d \u201c And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy . \u201d \u201c He likes to have his own way very well , \u201d replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . \u201c But so we all do . It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . I speak feelingly . A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . \u201d \u201c In my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? \u201d \u201c These are home questions -- and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature . But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . Younger sons can not marry where they like . \u201d \u201c Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . \u201d \u201c Our habits of expense make us too dependent , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . \u201d \u201c Is this , \u201d thought Elizabeth , \u201c meant for me ? \u201d and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , \u201c And pray , what is the usual price of an earl \u2019s younger son ? Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . \u201d He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said,-- \u201c I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present ; and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said Colonel Fitzwilliam , \u201c that is an advantage which he must divide with me . I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . \u201d \u201c Are you , indeed ? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make ? Does your charge give you much trouble ? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . \u201d As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly ; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . She directly replied,-- \u201c You need not be frightened . I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley . I think I have heard you say that you know them . \u201d \u201c I know them a little . Their brother is a pleasant , gentlemanlike man -- he is a great friend of Darcy \u2019s . \u201d \u201c Oh yes , \u201d said Elizabeth drily--\u201cMr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . \u201d \u201c Care of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy _ does _ take care of him in those points where he most wants care . From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . It was all conjecture . \u201d \u201c What is it you mean ? \u201d \u201c It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady \u2019s family it would be an unpleasant thing . \u201d \u201c You may depend upon my not mentioning it . \u201d \u201c And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars ; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . \u201d \u201c Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? \u201d \u201c I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . \u201d \u201c And what arts did he use to separate them ? \u201d \u201c He did not talk to me of his own arts , \u201d said Fitzwilliam , smiling . \u201c He only told me what I have now told you . \u201d Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation . After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful . \u201c I am thinking of what you have been telling me , \u201d said she . \u201c Your cousin \u2019s conduct does not suit my feelings . Why was he to be the judge ? \u201d \u201c You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? \u201d \u201c I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend \u2019s inclination ; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . But , \u201d she continued , recollecting herself , \u201c as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . \u201d \u201c That is not an unnatural surmise , \u201d said Fitzwilliam ; \u201c but it is lessening the honour of my cousin \u2019s triumph very sadly . \u201d This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the Parsonage . There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . There could not exist in the world _ two _ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence . That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _ he _ was the cause -- his pride and caprice were the cause -- of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted . \u201c There were some very strong objections against the lady , \u201d were Colonel Fitzwilliam \u2019s words ; and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . \u201c To Jane herself , \u201d she exclaimed , \u201c there could be no possibility of objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is ! Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . \u201d When she thought of her mother , indeed , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections _ there _ had material weight with Mr. Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend \u2019s connections than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister . The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . Mrs. Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine \u2019s being rather displeased by her staying at home .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [6, 7], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [9, 10], "text": "her"}, {"position": [20,
