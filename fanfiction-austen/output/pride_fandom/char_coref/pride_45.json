{"document": "XLV . Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley \u2019s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady \u2019s side the acquaintance would now be renewed . On reaching the house , they were shown through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . Its windows , opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . Georgiana \u2019s reception of them was very civil , but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . Mrs. Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well - bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her . She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room : she wished , she feared , that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley \u2019s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family . She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more . The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table . While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river ; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley \u2019s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over . Miss Darcy , on her brother \u2019s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility,-- \u201c Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ? They must be a great loss to _ your _ family . \u201d In Darcy \u2019s presence she dared not mention Wickham \u2019s name : but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment \u2019s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . While she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy \u2019s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy \u2019s meditated elopement . To no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley \u2019s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . He had certainly formed such a plan ; and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . Elizabeth \u2019s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair ; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully . Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth \u2019s person , behaviour , and dress . But Georgiana would not join her . Her brother \u2019s recommendation was enough to insure her favour : his judgment could not err ; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . \u201c How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , \u201d she cried : \u201c I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . She is grown so brown and coarse ! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . \u201d However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . \u201c For my own part , \u201d she rejoined , \u201c I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them . They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . \u201d Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected . He was resolutely silent , however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued,-- \u201c I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , \u2018 _ She _ a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . \u2019 But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , \u201c but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . \u201d He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of everything but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece \u2019s beginning the subject .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 10], "text": "Miss Bingley"}, {"position": [13, 14], "text": "her"}, {"position": [27, 28],
