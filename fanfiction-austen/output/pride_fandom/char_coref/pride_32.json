{"document": "XXXII . Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine ; and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter , that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy , and Mr. Darcy only , entered the room . He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologized for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . They then sat down , and when her inquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something ; and in this emergency recollecting _ when _ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed,-- \u201c How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London ? \u201d \u201c Perfectly so , I thank you . \u201d She found that she was to receive no other answer ; and , after a short pause , added,-- \u201c I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? \u201d \u201c I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . \u201d \u201c If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . But , perhaps , Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . \u201d \u201c I should not be surprised , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers . \u201d Elizabeth made no answer . She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . He took the hint and soon began with , \u201c This seems a very comfortable house . Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford . \u201d \u201c I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . \u201d \u201c Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . \u201d \u201c Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . She seems perfectly happy , however ; and , in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . \u201d \u201c It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . \u201d \u201c An easy distance do you call it ? It is nearly fifty miles . \u201d \u201c And what is fifty miles of good road ? Little more than half a day \u2019s journey . Yes , I call it a very easy distance . \u201d \u201c I should never have considered the distance as one of the _ advantages _ of the match , \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _ near _ her family . \u201d \u201c It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . \u201d As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered,-- \u201c I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . Where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . But that is not the case _ here _ . Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _ near _ her family under less than _ half _ the present distance . \u201d Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , \u201c _ You _ can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . _ You _ can not have been always at Longbourn . \u201d Elizabeth looked surprised . The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice,-- \u201c Are you pleased with Kent ? \u201d A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . The _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ surprised them . Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and , after sitting a few minutes longer , without saying much to anybody , went away . [ Illustration : \u201c Accompanied by their aunt \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] \u201c What can be the meaning of this ? \u201d said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone . \u201c My dear Eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . \u201d But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte \u2019s wishes , to be the case ; and , after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . All field sports were over . Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . They called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration , of her former favourite , George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam \u2019s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult to understand . It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . He seldom appeared really animated . Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him . Colonel Fitzwilliam \u2019s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend Eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out : she watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable . It was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend \u2019s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power . In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . He was , beyond comparison , the pleasantest man : he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [6, 7], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [30,
