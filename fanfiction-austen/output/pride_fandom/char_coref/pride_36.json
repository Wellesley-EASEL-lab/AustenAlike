{"document": "XXXVI . Elizabeth , when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded , that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . With a strong prejudice against everything he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension ; and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . His belief of her sister \u2019s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false ; and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . It was all pride and insolence . But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham -- when she read , with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself -- her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , \u201c This must be false ! This can not be ! This must be the grossest falsehood!\u201d--and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do : in half a minute the letter was unfolded again ; and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . So far each recital confirmed the other ; but when she came to the will , the difference was great . What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory ; and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other , and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . But when she read and re - read , with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham \u2019s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success . On both sides it was only assertion . Again she read on . But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy \u2019s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole . The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham \u2019s charge exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of inquiring . His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years \u2019 continuance . But no such recollection befriended her . She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address , but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . But , alas ! the story which followed , of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin \u2019s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question . At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin \u2019s corroboration . She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips \u2019s . Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . She was _ now _ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy -- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country , but that _ he _ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week . She remembered , also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been everywhere discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy \u2019s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son . How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned ! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at anything . His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive : he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown . Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that , proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance -- an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways -- seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible . She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . \u201c How despicably have I acted ! \u201d she cried . \u201c I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind . But vanity , not love , has been my folly . Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away where either were concerned . Till this moment , I never knew myself . \u201d From herself to Jane , from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy \u2019s explanation _ there _ had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . Widely different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister \u2019s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte \u2019s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane \u2019s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in tones of such mortifying , yet merited , reproach , her sense of shame was severe . The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial ; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt . It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane \u2019s disappointment had , in fact , been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before . After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought , reconsidering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself , as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr. Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just _ affect _ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it . Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object . She could think only of her letter .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [8, 9], "text": "her"}, {"position": [24, 25], "text": "she"}, {"position":
