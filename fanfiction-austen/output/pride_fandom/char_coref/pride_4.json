{"document": "IV . When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . \u201c He is just what a young - man ought to be , \u201d said she , \u201c sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! \u201d \u201c He is also handsome , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can . His character is thereby complete . \u201d \u201c I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . I did not expect such a compliment . \u201d \u201c Did not you ? _ I _ did for you . But that is one great difference between us . Compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . What could be more natural than his asking you again ? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . No thanks to his gallantry for that . Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . You have liked many a stupider person . \u201d \u201c Dear Lizzy ! \u201d \u201c Oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . You never see a fault in anybody . All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . \u201d \u201c I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but I always speak what I think . \u201d \u201c I know you do : and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . With _ your _ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets with it everywhere . But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the good of everybody \u2019s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad,--belongs to you alone . And so , you like this man \u2019s sisters , too , do you ? Their manners are not equal to his . \u201d \u201c Certainly not , at first ; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . \u201d Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced : their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment , too , unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . They were , in fact , very fine ladies ; not deficient in good - humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . They were rather handsome ; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town ; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds ; were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were , therefore , in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others . They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother \u2019s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr. Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but , as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table ; nor was Mrs. Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted , by an accidental recommendation , to look at Netherfield House . He did look at it , and into it , for half an hour ; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , and ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . On the strength of Darcy \u2019s regard , Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . In understanding , Darcy was the superior . Bingley was by no means deficient ; but Darcy was clever . He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious ; and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared ; Darcy was continually giving offence . The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him ; there had been no formality , no stiffness ; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty ; but she smiled too much . Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so ; but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl ; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [5, 6], "text":
