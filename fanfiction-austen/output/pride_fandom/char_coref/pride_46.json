{"document": "XLVI . Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third her repining was over , and her sister justified , by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been mis - sent elsewhere . Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . The one mis - sent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . It was to this effect:-- \u201c Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . \u201d Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth , on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . \u201c By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I can not answer for being coherent . Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . Though Lydia \u2019s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. , intending to trace their route . He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney - coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . I know not what to think . After making every possible inquiry on that side of London , Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success,--no such people had been seen to pass through . With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. ; but no one can throw any blame on them . Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . My father and mother believe the worst , but I can not think so ill of him . Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia \u2019s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to everything ? Impossible ! I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage : he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted . My poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . Could she exert herself , it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . Adieu ! I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such , that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening . In such an exigence my uncle \u2019s advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . \u201d \u201c Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? \u201d cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr. Darcy appeared . Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia \u2019s situation , hastily exclaimed , \u201c I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . \u201d \u201c Good God ! what is the matter ? \u201d cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , \u201c I will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . You are not well enough ; you can not go yourself . \u201d Elizabeth hesitated ; but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home instantly . On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , \u201c Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . \u201d \u201c No , I thank you , \u201d she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . \u201c There is nothing the matter with me . I am quite well , I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . \u201d She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . At length she spoke again . \u201c I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . It can not be concealed from anyone . My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham . They are gone off together from Brighton . _ You _ know him too well to doubt the rest . She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . \u201d Darcy was fixed in astonishment . \u201c When I consider , \u201d she added , in a yet more agitated voice , \u201c that _ I _ might have prevented it ! _ I _ who knew what he was . Had I but explained some part of it only -- some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened . But it is all , all too late now . \u201d \u201c I am grieved , indeed , \u201d cried Darcy : \u201c grieved -- shocked . But is it certain , absolutely certain ? \u201d \u201c Oh , yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond : they are certainly not gone to Scotland . \u201d \u201c And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? \u201d \u201c My father has gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle \u2019s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . How is such a man to be worked on ? How are they even to be discovered ? I have not the smallest hope . It is every way horrible ! \u201d Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence . \u201c When _ my _ eyes were opened to his real character , oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared to do ! But I knew not -- I was afraid of doing too much . Wretched , wretched mistake ! \u201d Darcy made no answer . He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy . Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . Her power was sinking ; everything _ must _ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . She could neither wonder nor condemn ; but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress . It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . Lydia -- the humiliation , the misery she was bringing on them all -- soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said,-- \u201c I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress ! But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister \u2019s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . \u201d \u201c Oh , yes ! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy . Say that urgent business calls us home immediately . Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it can not be long . \u201d He readily assured her of his secrecy , again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and , leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious parting look , went away . As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth \u2019s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might , perhaps , authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia \u2019s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . Never since reading Jane \u2019s second letter had she entertained a hope of Wickham \u2019s meaning to marry her . No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . Surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development . While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise , all astonishment , that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible . But now it was all too natural . For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him ; but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody . Sometimes one officer , sometimes another , had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . Her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object . The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl -- oh ! how acutely did she now feel it ! She was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle \u2019s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe . Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant \u2019s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , everything relating to their journey was speedily settled . They were to be off as soon as possible . \u201c But what is to be done about Pemberley ? \u201d cried Mrs. Gardiner . \u201c John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . _ That _ is all settled . \u201d \u201c What is all settled ? \u201d repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . \u201c And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ? Oh , that I knew how it was ! \u201d But wishes were vain ; or , at best , could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr. Gardiner , meanwhile , having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [21, 22], "text":
