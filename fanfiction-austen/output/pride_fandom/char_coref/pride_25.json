{"document": "XXV . After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . On the following Monday , Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came , as usual , to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . Mr. Gardiner was a sensible , gentlemanlike man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well - bred and agreeable . Mrs. Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces . Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . They had frequently been staying with her in town . The first part of Mrs. Gardiner \u2019s business , on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . When this was done , she had a less active part to play . It became her turn to listen . Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister . Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . \u201c I do not blame Jane , \u201d she continued , \u201c for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . But , Lizzy ! Oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins \u2019s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . The Lucases are very artful people , indeed , sister . They are all for what they can get . I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves . \u201d Mrs. Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth \u2019s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and , in compassion to her nieces , turned the conversation . When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . \u201c It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , \u201d said she . \u201c I am sorry it went off . But these things happen so often ! A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and , when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c Offended two or three young ladies \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] \u201c An excellent consolation in its way , \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c but it will not do for _ us _ . We do not suffer by accident . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . \u201d \u201c But that expression of \u2018 violently in love \u2019 is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . It is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour \u2019s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . Pray , how _ violent was _ Mr. Bingley \u2019s love ? \u201d \u201c I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance ; and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer . Could there be finer symptoms ? Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? \u201d \u201c Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . Poor Jane ! I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . \u201d Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister \u2019s ready acquiescence . \u201c I hope , \u201d added Mrs. Gardiner , \u201c that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . \u201d \u201c And _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? Mr. Darcy may , perhaps , have _ heard _ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month \u2019s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and , depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . \u201d \u201c So much the better . I hope they will not meet at all . But does not Jane correspond with his sister ? _ She _ will not be able to help calling . \u201d \u201c She will drop the acquaintance entirely . \u201d But , in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley \u2019s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane \u2019s attractions . Miss Bennet accepted her aunt \u2019s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped , by Caroline \u2019s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth \u2019s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . To Mrs. Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged . They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy \u2019s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring . Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well . Here , consequently , was an inexhaustible subject of discourse . In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself . On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy \u2019s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman \u2019s reputed disposition , when quite a lad , which might agree with it ; and was confident , at last , that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy .
