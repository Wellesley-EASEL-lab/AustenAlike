{"document": "XXVII . With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and February pass away . March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford . She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins . There was novelty in the scheme ; and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . The journey would , moreover , give her a peep at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . Everything , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte \u2019s first sketch . She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became as perfect as plan could be . The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . Her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good - humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William \u2019s too long . He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out , like his information . It was a journey of only twenty - four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon . As they drove to Mr. Gardiner \u2019s door , Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival : when they entered the passage , she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever . On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin \u2019s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . All was joy and kindness . The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres . Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute inquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection . It was reasonable , however , to hope that they would not continue long . Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley \u2019s visit in Gracechurch Street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham \u2019s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well . \u201c But , my dear Elizabeth , \u201d she added , \u201c what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . \u201d \u201c Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . \u201d \u201c If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . \u201d \u201c She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . I know no harm of her . \u201d \u201c But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather \u2019s death made her mistress of this fortune ? \u201d \u201c No -- why should he ? If it were not allowable for him to gain _ my _ affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? \u201d \u201c But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . \u201d \u201c A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . If _ she _ does not object to it , why should _ we _ ? \u201d \u201c _ Her _ not objecting does not justify _ him _ . It only shows her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling . \u201d \u201c Well , \u201d cried Elizabeth , \u201c have it as you choose . _ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . \u201d \u201c No , Lizzy , that is what I do _ not _ choose . I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . \u201d \u201c Oh , if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . I am sick of them all . Thank heaven ! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him . Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . \u201d \u201c Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . \u201d Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . \u201c We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , \u201d said Mrs. Gardiner ; \u201c but perhaps , to the Lakes . \u201d No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . \u201c My dear , dear aunt , \u201d she rapturously cried , \u201c what delight ! what felicity ! You give me fresh life and vigour . Adieu to disappointment and spleen . What are men to rocks and mountains ? Oh , what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we _ do _ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything . We _ will _ know where we have gone -- we _ will _ recollect what we have seen . Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . Let _ our _ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c At the door \u201d ]", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [41, 42],
