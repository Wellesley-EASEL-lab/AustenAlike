{"document": "LIV . As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or , in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more . Mr. Darcy \u2019s behaviour astonished and vexed her . \u201c Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , \u201d said she , \u201c did he come at all ? \u201d She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . \u201c He could be still amiable , still pleasing to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? If he fears me , why come hither ? If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? Teasing , teasing man ! I will think no more about him . \u201d Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth . \u201c Now , \u201d said she , \u201c that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . I am glad he dines here on Tuesday . It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . \u201d \u201c Yes , very indifferent , indeed , \u201d said Elizabeth , laughingly . \u201c Oh , Jane ! take care . \u201d \u201c My dear Lizzy , you can not think me so weak as to be in danger now . \u201d \u201c I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . \u201d They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs. Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good - humour and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour \u2019s visit , had revived . On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time . When they repaired to the dining - room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself . On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided . He placed himself by her . Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . He bore it with noble indifference ; and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy , with an expression of half - laughing alarm . His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that , if left wholly to himself , Jane \u2019s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them . He was on one side of her mother . She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse ; but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did . Her mother \u2019s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth \u2019s mind ; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . Anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing - room before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil . She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . \u201c If he does not come to me , _ then _ , \u201d said she , \u201c I shall give him up for ever . \u201d The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair . And on the gentlemen \u2019s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper,-- \u201c The men sha n\u2019t come and part us , I am determined . We want none of them ; do we ? \u201d Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . She followed him with her eyes , envied everyone to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee , and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! \u201c A man who has once been refused ! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? Is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . \u201d She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee - cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying,-- \u201c Is your sister at Pemberley still ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; she will remain there till Christmas . \u201d \u201c And quite alone ? Have all her friends left her ? \u201d \u201c Mrs. Annesley is with her . The others have been gone on to Scarborough these three weeks . \u201d She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady \u2019s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . When the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose ; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother \u2019s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . She now lost every expectation of pleasure . They were confined for the evening at different tables ; and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself . Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was , unluckily , ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . \u201c Well , girls , \u201d said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , \u201c what say you to the day ? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . The venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases \u2019 last week ; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least . And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . And what do you think she said besides ? \u2018 Ah ! Mrs. Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last ! \u2019 She did , indeed . I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . \u201d Mrs. Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits : she had seen enough of Bingley \u2019s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . \u201c It has been a very agreeable day , \u201d said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . \u201c The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . I hope we may often meet again . \u201d Elizabeth smiled . \u201c Lizzy , you must not do so . You must not suspect me . It mortifies me . I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it . I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . \u201d \u201c You are very cruel , \u201d said her sister , \u201c you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . \u201d \u201c How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! And how impossible in others ! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? \u201d \u201c That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _ me _ your confidante . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [9, 10], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [14, 15], "text":
