{"document": "LX . Elizabeth \u2019s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . \u201c How could you begin ? \u201d said she . \u201c I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? \u201d \u201c I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . It is too long ago . I was in the middle before I knew that I _ had _ begun . \u201d \u201c My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . Now , be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? \u201d \u201c For the liveliness of your mind I did . \u201d \u201c You may as well call it impertinence at once . It was very little less . The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . I roused and interested you , because I was so unlike _ them _ . Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . To be sure you know no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . \u201d \u201c Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? \u201d \u201c Dearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ? But make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly , by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last ? What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? \u201d \u201c Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . \u201d \u201c But I was embarrassed . \u201d \u201c And so was I. \u201d \u201c You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . \u201d \u201c A man who had felt less might . \u201d \u201c How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . I wonder when you _ would _ have spoken if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . _ Too much _ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? This will never do . \u201d \u201c You need not distress yourself . The moral will be perfectly fair . Lady Catherine \u2019s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours . My aunt \u2019s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know everything . \u201d \u201c Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequences ? \u201d \u201c My real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . \u201d \u201c Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her ? \u201d \u201c I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . But it ought to be done ; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly . \u201d \u201c And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . \u201d From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner \u2019s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- \u201c I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . You supposed more than really existed . But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes . How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful . We will go round the park every day . I am the happiest creature in the world . Perhaps other people have said so before , but no one with such justice . I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me . You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . Yours , \u201d etc . Mr. Darcy \u2019s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style , and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins , in return for his last . / * \u201c Dear Sir , * / \u201c I must trouble you once more for congratulations . Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy . Console Lady Catherine as well as you can . But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . He has more to give . \u201c Yours sincerely , \u201d etc . Miss Bingley \u2019s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere . She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother \u2019s in sending it . Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge . The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew \u2019s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over . At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . He bore it , however , with admirable calmness . He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James \u2019s , with very decent composure . If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . Mrs. Philips \u2019s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs. Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley \u2019s good - humour encouraged ; yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar . Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .", "clusters": [{"mentions":
