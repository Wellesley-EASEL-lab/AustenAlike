{"document": "VI . The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . The visit was returned in due form . Miss Bennet \u2019s pleasing manners grew on the good - will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable , and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _ them _ was expressed towards the two eldest . By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value , as arising , in all probability , from the influence of their brother \u2019s admiration . It was generally evident , whenever they met , that he _ did _ admire her ; and to _ her _ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . She mentioned this to her friend , Miss Lucas . \u201c It may , perhaps , be pleasant , \u201d replied Charlotte , \u201c to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . We can all _ begin _ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better show _ more _ affection than she feels . Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . \u201d \u201c But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . If _ I _ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . \u201d \u201c Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane \u2019s disposition as you do . \u201d \u201c But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . \u201d \u201c Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . \u201d \u201c Your plan is a good one , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . But these are not Jane \u2019s feelings ; she is not acting by design . As yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . She has known him only a fortnight . She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . \u201d \u201c Not as you represent it . Had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . \u201d \u201c Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . \u201d \u201c Well , \u201d said Charlotte , \u201c I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . \u201d \u201c You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . \u201d Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley \u2019s attention to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty : he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . Of this she was perfectly unaware : to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . He began to wish to know more of her ; and , as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . His doing so drew her notice . It was at Sir William Lucas \u2019s , where a large party were assembled . \u201c What does Mr. Darcy mean , \u201d said she to Charlotte , \u201c by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? \u201d \u201c That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . \u201d \u201c But if he does it any more , I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c The entreaties of several \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said,-- \u201c Did not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? \u201d \u201c With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . \u201d \u201c You are severe on us . \u201d \u201c It will be _ her _ turn soon to be teased , \u201d said Miss Lucas . \u201c I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . \u201d \u201c You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . \u201d On Miss Lucas \u2019s persevering , however , she added , \u201c Very well ; if it must be so , it must . \u201d And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy , \u201c There is a very fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with--\u2018Keep your breath to cool your porridge,\u2019--and I shall keep mine to swell my song . \u201d Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began:-- \u201c What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing , after all . I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . \u201d \u201c Certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world : every savage can dance . \u201d Sir William only smiled . \u201c Your friend performs delightfully , \u201d he continued , after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; \u201c and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr. Darcy . \u201d \u201c You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , sir . \u201d \u201c Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . Do you often dance at St. James \u2019s ? \u201d \u201c Never , sir . \u201d \u201c Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? \u201d \u201c It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . \u201d \u201c You have a house in town , I conclude ? \u201d Mr. Darcy bowed . \u201c I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself , for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . \u201d He paused in hopes of an answer : but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her,-- \u201c My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You can not refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . \u201d And , taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr. Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William,-- \u201c Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . \u201d Mr. Darcy , with grave propriety , requested to be allowed the honour of her hand , but in vain . Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . \u201c You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . \u201d \u201c Mr. Darcy is all politeness , \u201d said Elizabeth , smiling . \u201c He is , indeed : but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? \u201d Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,-- \u201c I can guess the subject of your reverie . \u201d \u201c I should imagine not . \u201d \u201c You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner,--in such society ; and , indeed , I am quite of your opinion . I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity , and yet the noise -- the nothingness , and yet the self - importance , of all these people ! What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! \u201d \u201c Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . My mind was more agreeably engaged . I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . \u201d Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections . Mr. Darcy replied , with great intrepidity,-- \u201c Miss Elizabeth Bennet . \u201d \u201c Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! \u201d repeated Miss Bingley . \u201c I am all astonishment . How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? \u201d \u201c That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . A lady \u2019s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . I knew you would be wishing me joy . \u201d \u201c Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . \u201d He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner ; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed along .
