{"document": "XXIX . Mr. Collins \u2019s triumph , in consequence of this invitation , was complete . The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine \u2019s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . \u201c I confess , \u201d said he , \u201c that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship \u2019s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ? \u201d \u201c I am the less surprised at what has happened , \u201d replied Sir William , \u201c from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . About the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . \u201d Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings . Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner , might not wholly overpower them . When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth,-- \u201c Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . \u201d While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company ; and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James \u2019s . As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh . When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria \u2019s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth \u2019s courage did not fail her . She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation . From the entrance hall , of which Mr. Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . In spite of having been at St. James \u2019s , Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . She was not rendered formidable by silence : but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth \u2019s mind ; and , from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria \u2019s astonishment at her being so thin and so small . There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies . Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly : her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs. Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes . After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view , Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her Ladyship \u2019s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son - in - law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . The party did not supply much conversation . Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime . Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed . Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . When the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted . She inquired into Charlotte \u2019s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all ; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry . Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady \u2019s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others . In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who , she observed to Mrs. Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . She asked her at different times how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother \u2019s maiden name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed,-- \u201c Your father \u2019s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think ? For your sake , \u201d turning to Charlotte , \u201c I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh \u2019s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? \u201d \u201c A little . \u201d \u201c Oh then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? \u201d \u201c One of them does . \u201d \u201c Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours . Do you draw ? \u201d \u201c No , not at all . \u201d \u201c What , none of you ? \u201d \u201c Not one . \u201d \u201c That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . \u201d \u201c My mother would have no objection , but my father hates London . \u201d \u201c Has your governess left you ? \u201d \u201c We never had any governess . \u201d \u201c No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . \u201d Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . \u201c Then who taught you ? who attended to you ? Without a governess , you must have been neglected . \u201d \u201c Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means . We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . Those who chose to be idle certainly might . \u201d \u201c Ay , no doubt : but that is what a governess will prevent ; and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe \u2019s calling yesterday to thank me ? She finds Miss Pope a treasure . \u2018 Lady Catherine , \u2019 said she , \u2018 you have given me a treasure . \u2019 Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? \u201d \u201c Yes , ma\u2019am , all . \u201d \u201c All ! What , all five out at once ? Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? \u201d \u201c Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . Perhaps _ she _ is full young to be much in company . But really , ma\u2019am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first . And to be kept back on _ such _ a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . \u201d \u201c Upon my word , \u201d said her Ladyship , \u201c you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? \u201d \u201c With three younger sisters grown up , \u201d replied Elizabeth , smiling , \u201c your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . \u201d Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . \u201c You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . \u201d \u201c I am not one - and - twenty . \u201d When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party . Their table was superlatively stupid . Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh \u2019s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . A great deal more passed at the other table . Lady Catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologizing if he thought he won too many . Sir William did not say much . He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names . When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broken up , the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach ; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins \u2019s side , and as many bows on Sir William \u2019s , they departed . As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte \u2019s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship \u2019s praise into his own hands .", "clusters":
