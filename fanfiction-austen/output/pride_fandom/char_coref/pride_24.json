{"document": "XXIV . Miss Bingley \u2019s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother \u2019s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . Hope was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . Miss Darcy \u2019s praise occupied the chief of it . Her many attractions were again dwelt on ; and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother \u2019s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy \u2019s house , and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . Her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others . To Caroline \u2019s assertion of her brother \u2019s being partial to Miss Darcy , she paid no credit . That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best ; but her sister \u2019s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . She could think of nothing else ; and yet , whether Bingley \u2019s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends \u2019 interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane \u2019s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister \u2019s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last , on Mrs. Bennet \u2019s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying,-- \u201c O that my dear mother had more command over herself ! she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . But I will not repine . It can not last long . He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . \u201d Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . \u201c You doubt me , \u201d cried Jane , slightly colouring ; \u201c indeed , you have no reason . He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all . I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . Thank God I have not _ that _ pain . A little time , therefore -- I shall certainly try to get the better---- \u201d With a stronger voice she soon added , \u201c I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . \u201d \u201c My dear Jane , \u201d exclaimed Elizabeth , \u201c you are too good . Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you . I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . \u201d Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister \u2019s warm affection . \u201c Nay , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c this is not fair . _ You _ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody . _ I _ only want to think _ you _ perfect , and you set yourself against it . Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good - will . You need not . There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately : one I will not mention , the other is Charlotte \u2019s marriage . It is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! \u201d \u201c My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . They will ruin your happiness . You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . Consider Mr. Collins \u2019s respectability , and Charlotte \u2019s prudent , steady character . Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody \u2019s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . \u201d \u201c To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man : you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking . You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . \u201d \u201c I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , \u201d replied Jane ; \u201c and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . But enough of this . You alluded to something else . You mentioned _ two _ instances . I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . Women fancy admiration means more than it does . \u201d \u201c And men take care that they should . \u201d \u201c If it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . \u201d \u201c I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley \u2019s conduct to design , \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c but , without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error and there may be misery . Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people \u2019s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . \u201d \u201c And do you impute it to either of those ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; to the last . But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . Stop me , whilst you can . \u201d \u201c You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ? \u201d \u201c Yes , in conjunction with his friend . \u201d \u201c I can not believe it . Why should they try to influence him ? They can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it . \u201d \u201c Your first position is false . They may wish many things besides his happiness : they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . \u201d \u201c Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy , \u201d replied Jane ; \u201c but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother \u2019s . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . By supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . Do not distress me by the idea . I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . \u201d Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr. Bingley \u2019s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more ; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . Mrs. Bennet \u2019s best comfort was , that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer . Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently . \u201c So , Lizzy , \u201d said he , one day , \u201c your sister is crossed in love , I find . I congratulate her . Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . When is your turn to come ? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane . Now is your time . Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . Let Wickham be your man . He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . \u201d \u201c Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . We must not all expect Jane \u2019s good fortune . \u201d \u201c True , \u201d said Mr. Bennet ; \u201c but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . \u201d Mr. Wickham \u2019s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family . They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve . The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr. Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter . Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of Hertfordshire : her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes ; but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 4], "text": "Miss Bingley"},
