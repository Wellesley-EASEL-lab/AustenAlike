{"document": "II . Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley . He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it . It was then disclosed in the following manner . Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with,-- \u201c I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . \u201d \u201c We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , \u201d said her mother , resentfully , \u201c since we are not to visit . \u201d \u201c But you forget , mamma , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . \u201d \u201c I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . \u201d \u201c No more have I , \u201d said Mr. Bennet ; \u201c and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . \u201d Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but , unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . \u201c Do n\u2019t keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven \u2019s sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . \u201d \u201c Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , \u201d said her father ; \u201c she times them ill . \u201d \u201c I do not cough for my own amusement , \u201d replied Kitty , fretfully . \u201c When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? \u201d \u201c To - morrow fortnight . \u201d \u201c Ay , so it is , \u201d cried her mother , \u201c and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . \u201d \u201c Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . \u201d \u201c Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? \u201d \u201c I honour your circumspection . A fortnight \u2019s acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . \u201d The girls stared at their father . Mrs. Bennet said only , \u201c Nonsense , nonsense ! \u201d \u201c What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? \u201d cried he . \u201c Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you _ there _ . What say you , Mary ? For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books , and make extracts . \u201d Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . \u201c While Mary is adjusting her ideas , \u201d he continued , \u201c let us return to Mr. Bingley . \u201d \u201c I am sick of Mr. Bingley , \u201d cried his wife . \u201c I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did you not tell me so before ? If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . \u201d The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished -- that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . \u201c How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! And it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . \u201d \u201c Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , \u201d said Mr. Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . \u201c What an excellent father you have , girls , \u201d said she , when the door was shut . \u201c I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . At our time of life , it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes we would do anything . Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . \u201d \u201c Oh , \u201d said Lydia , stoutly , \u201c I am not afraid ; for though I _ am _ the youngest , I \u2019m the tallest . \u201d The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet \u2019s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .
