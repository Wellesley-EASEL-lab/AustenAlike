{"document": "L. Mr. Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him . He now wished it more than ever . Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place . He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother - in - law ; and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . When first Mr. Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . This son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . Five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs. Bennet , for many years after Lydia \u2019s birth , had been certain that he would . This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy ; and her husband \u2019s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income . Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children . But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents . This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him . He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement . He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother \u2019s hands , Lydia \u2019s expenses had been very little within that sum . That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . His letter was soon despatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution . He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her . The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood . It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . To be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world in some distant farm - house . But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such a husband her misery was considered certain . It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph . The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants . She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter ; and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . \u201c Haye Park might do , \u201d said she , \u201c if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off . I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . \u201d Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained . But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , \u201c Mrs. Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . Into _ one _ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . I will not encourage the imprudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . \u201d A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr. Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and Mrs. Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion . Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it . That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible . She was more alive to the disgrace , which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter \u2019s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place . Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot . She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister \u2019s frailty would have mortified her so much . Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself ; for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them . Had Lydia \u2019s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . She was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . She was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet . What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both : by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved ; and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was . An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine . But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . To Mr. Bennet \u2019s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . \u201c It was greatly my wish that he should do so , \u201d he added , \u201c as soon as his marriage was fixed on . And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece \u2019s . It is Mr. Wickham \u2019s intention to go into the Regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General---- \u2019s regiment , now quartered in the north . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information ? He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Yours , etc . \u201c E. GARDINER . \u201d Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham \u2019s removal from the ----shire , as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do . But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it . Lydia \u2019s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites . \u201c She is so fond of Mrs. Forster , \u201d said she , \u201c it will be quite shocking to send her away ! And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . The officers may not be so pleasant in General---- \u2019s regiment . \u201d His daughter \u2019s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister \u2019s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north . When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that , as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme ; and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [0, 3], "text": "L.
