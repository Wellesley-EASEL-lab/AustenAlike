{"document": "LVII . The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly . Lady Catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy . It was a rational scheme , to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of Bingley , and _ her _ being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea . She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached Lady Catherine , ) had only set _ that _ down as almost certain and immediate which _ she _ had looked forward to as possible at some future time . In revolving Lady Catherine \u2019s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference . From what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce . She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _ she _ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one _ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side . With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning . If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him . In that case he would return no more . Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . \u201c If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , \u201d she added , \u201c I shall know how to understand it . I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . \u201d The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great : but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet \u2019s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject . The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . \u201c Lizzy , \u201d said he , \u201c I was going to look for you : come into my room . \u201d She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine , and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations . She followed her father to the fireplace , and they both sat down . He then said,-- \u201c I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . I did not know before that I had _ two _ daughters on the brink of matrimony . Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . \u201d The colour now rushed into Elizabeth \u2019s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself , when her father continued,-- \u201c You look conscious . Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even _ your _ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer . This letter is from Mr. Collins . \u201d \u201c From Mr. Collins ! and what can _ he _ have to say ? \u201d \u201c Something very much to the purpose , of course . He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases . I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point . What relates to yourself is as follows:--\u2018Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another , of which we have been advertised by the same authority . Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it ; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . \u2019 Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? \u2018 This young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . Yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman \u2019s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . \u2019 Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? But now it comes out . \u2018 My motive for cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . \u2019 _ Mr. Darcy _ , you see , is the man ! Now , Lizzy , I think I _ have _ surprised you . Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _ you _ in his life ! It is admirable ! \u201d Elizabeth tried to join in her father \u2019s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . \u201c Are you not diverted ? \u201d \u201c Oh , yes . Pray read on . \u201d \u201c \u2018 After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . \u2019 Mr. Collins , moreover , adds , \u2018 I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia \u2019s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . \u2019 _ That _ is his notion of Christian forgiveness ! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte \u2019s situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . You are not going to be _ missish _ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? \u201d \u201c Oh , \u201d cried Elizabeth , \u201c I am exceedingly diverted . But it is so strange ! \u201d \u201c Yes , _ that _ is what makes it amusing . Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference and _ your _ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd ! Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins \u2019s correspondence for any consideration . Nay , when I read a letter of his , I can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? Did she call to refuse her consent ? \u201d To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . It was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried . Her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of Mr. Darcy \u2019s indifference ; and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that , perhaps , instead of his seeing too _ little _ , she might have fancied too _ much _ .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 12], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text": "she"}, {"position": [85,
