{"document": "VIII . At five o\u2019clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half - past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . To the civil inquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley , she could not make a very favourable answer . Jane was by no means better . The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards Jane , when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing ; and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others . She had very little notice from any but him . Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr. Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who , when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence : she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . Mrs. Hurst thought the same , and added,-- \u201c She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . I shall never forget her appearance this morning . She really looked almost wild . \u201d \u201c She did indeed , Louisa . I could hardly keep my countenance . Very nonsensical to come at all ! Why must _ she _ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? Her hair so untidy , so blowzy ! \u201d \u201c Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain , and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . \u201d \u201c Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , \u201d said Bingley ; \u201c but this was all lost upon me . I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . \u201d \u201c _ You _ observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , \u201d said Miss Bingley ; \u201c and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your sister _ make such an exhibition . \u201d \u201c Certainly not . \u201d \u201c To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country - town indifference to decorum . \u201d \u201c It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , \u201d said Bingley . \u201c I am afraid , Mr. Darcy , \u201d observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , \u201c that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . \u201d \u201c Not at all , \u201d he replied : \u201c they were brightened by the exercise . \u201d A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs. Hurst began again,-- \u201c I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . \u201d \u201c I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . \u201d \u201c That is capital , \u201d added her sister ; and they both laughed heartily . \u201c If they had uncles enough to fill _ all _ Cheapside , \u201d cried Bingley , \u201c it would not make them one jot less agreeable . \u201d \u201c But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , \u201d replied Darcy . To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend \u2019s vulgar relations . With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . On entering the drawing - room , she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high , she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself , for the short time she could stay below , with a book . Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment . \u201c Do you prefer reading to cards ? \u201d said he ; \u201c that is rather singular . \u201d \u201c Miss Eliza Bennet , \u201d said Miss Bingley , \u201c despises cards . She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . \u201d \u201c I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , \u201d cried Elizabeth ; \u201c I am _ not _ a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . \u201d \u201c In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , \u201d said Bingley ; \u201c and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . \u201d Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying . He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . \u201c And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow ; and though I have not many , I have more than I ever looked into . \u201d Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . \u201c I am astonished , \u201d said Miss Bingley , \u201c that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr. Darcy ! \u201d \u201c It ought to be good , \u201d he replied : \u201c it has been the work of many generations . \u201d \u201c And then you have added so much to it yourself -- you are always buying books . \u201d \u201c I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . \u201d \u201c Neglect ! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . Charles , when you build _ your _ house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . \u201d \u201c I wish it may . \u201d \u201c But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . \u201d \u201c With all my heart : I will buy Pemberley itself , if Darcy will sell it . \u201d \u201c I am talking of possibilities , Charles . \u201d \u201c Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . \u201d Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and , soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . \u201c Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? \u201d said Miss Bingley : \u201c will she be as tall as I am ? \u201d \u201c I think she will . She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet \u2019s height , or rather taller . \u201d \u201c How I long to see her again ! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . Such a countenance , such manners , and so extremely accomplished for her age ! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite . \u201d \u201c It is amazing to me , \u201d said Bingley , \u201c how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are . \u201d \u201c All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles , what do you mean ? \u201d \u201c Yes , all of them , I think . They all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . I scarcely know any one who can not do all this ; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . \u201d \u201c Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c has too much truth . The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen ; but I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . I can not boast of knowing more than half - a - dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished . \u201d \u201c Nor I , I am sure , \u201d said Miss Bingley . \u201c Then , \u201d observed Elizabeth , \u201c you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . \u201d \u201c Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . \u201d \u201c Oh , certainly , \u201d cried his faithful assistant , \u201c no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and , besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . \u201d \u201c All this she must possess , \u201d added Darcy ; \u201c and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . \u201d \u201c I am no longer surprised at your knowing _ only _ six accomplished women . I rather wonder now at your knowing _ any _ . \u201d \u201c Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ? \u201d \u201c _ I _ never saw such a woman . _ I _ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . \u201d Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr. Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . \u201c Eliza Bennet , \u201d said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , \u201c is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I daresay , it succeeds ; but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . \u201d \u201c Undoubtedly , \u201d replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , \u201c there is meanness in _ all _ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . \u201d Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . Bingley urged Mr. Jones \u2019s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians . This she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother \u2019s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better . Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . They solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper ; while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .
