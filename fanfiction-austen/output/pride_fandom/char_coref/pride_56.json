{"document": "LVI . One morning , about a week after Bingley \u2019s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . It was too early in the morning for visitors ; and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them . As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . They both set off ; and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh . They were of course all intending to be surprised : but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt . She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth \u2019s salutation than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her Ladyship \u2019s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . Mrs. Bennet , all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . After sitting for a moment in silence , she said , very stiffly , to Elizabeth,-- \u201c I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . That lady , I suppose , is your mother ? \u201d Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . \u201c And _ that _ , I suppose , is one of your sisters ? \u201d \u201c Yes , madam , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine . \u201c She is my youngest girl but one . My youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the ground , walking with a young man , who , I believe , will soon become a part of the family . \u201d \u201c You have a very small park here , \u201d returned Lady Catherine , after a short silence . \u201c It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my Lady , I dare say ; but , I assure you , it is much larger than Sir William Lucas \u2019s . \u201d \u201c This must be a most inconvenient sitting - room for the evening in summer : the windows are full west . \u201d Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added,-- \u201c May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very well . I saw them the night before last . \u201d Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled . Mrs. Bennet , with great civility , begged her Ladyship to take some refreshment : but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating anything ; and then , rising up , said to Elizabeth,-- \u201c Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . \u201d \u201c Go , my dear , \u201d cried her mother , \u201c and show her Ladyship about the different walks . I think she will be pleased with the hermitage . \u201d Elizabeth obeyed ; and , running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest downstairs . As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent - looking rooms , walked on . Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting - woman was in it . They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . \u201c How could I ever think her like her nephew ? \u201d said she , as she looked in her face . As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner:-- \u201c You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . \u201d Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . \u201c Indeed , you are mistaken , madam ; I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . \u201d \u201c Miss Bennet , \u201d replied her Ladyship , in an angry tone , \u201c you ought to know that I am not to be trifled with . But however insincere _ you _ may choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so . My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness ; and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago . I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _ you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew -- my own nephew , Mr. Darcy . Though I _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . \u201d \u201c If you believed it impossible to be true , \u201d said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , \u201c I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . What could your Ladyship propose by it ? \u201d \u201c At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . \u201d \u201c Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , \u201d said Elizabeth coolly , \u201c will be rather a confirmation of it -- if , indeed , such a report is in existence . \u201d \u201c If ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? \u201d \u201c I never heard that it was . \u201d \u201c And can you likewise declare , that there is no _ foundation _ for it ? \u201d \u201c I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship . _ You _ may ask questions which _ I _ shall not choose to answer . \u201d \u201c This is not to be borne . Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? \u201d \u201c Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible . \u201d \u201c It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . But _ your _ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . You may have drawn him in . \u201d \u201c If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . \u201d \u201c Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? I have not been accustomed to such language as this . I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . \u201d \u201c But you are not entitled to know _ mine _ ; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit . \u201d \u201c Let me be rightly understood . This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . No , never . Mr. Darcy is engaged to _ my daughter _ . Now , what have you to say ? \u201d \u201c Only this,--that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . \u201d Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied,-- \u201c The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . It was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers . While in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends -- to his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh ? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? \u201d \u201c Yes ; and I had heard it before . But what is that to me ? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh . You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . Its completion depended on others . If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? \u201d \u201c Because honour , decorum , prudence -- nay , interest -- forbid it . Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . \u201d \u201c These are heavy misfortunes , \u201d replied Elizabeth . \u201c But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . \u201d \u201c Obstinate , headstrong girl ! I am ashamed of you ! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? Is nothing due to me on that score ? Let us sit down . You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it . I have not been used to submit to any person \u2019s whims . I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . \u201d \u201c _ That _ will make your Ladyship \u2019s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _ me _ . \u201d \u201c I will not be interrupted ! Hear me in silence . My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . They are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father \u2019s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled , families . Their fortune on both sides is splendid . They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune ! Is this to be endured ? But it must not , shall not be ! If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . \u201d \u201c In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman \u2019s daughter ; so far we are equal . \u201d \u201c True . You _ are _ a gentleman \u2019s daughter . But what was your mother ? Who are your uncles and aunts ? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . \u201d \u201c Whatever my connections may be , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . \u201d \u201c Tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? \u201d Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment \u2019s deliberation,-- \u201c I am not . \u201d Lady Catherine seemed pleased . \u201c And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement ? \u201d \u201c I will make no promise of the kind . \u201d \u201c Miss Bennet , I am shocked and astonished . I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede . I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . \u201d \u201c And I certainly _ never _ shall give it . I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ? Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these . How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no further on the subject . \u201d \u201c Not so hasty , if you please . I have by no means done . To all the objections I have already urged I have still another to add . I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister \u2019s infamous elopement . I know it all ; that the young man \u2019s marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expense of your father and uncle . And is _ such _ a girl to be my nephew \u2019s sister ? Is _ her _ husband , who is the son of his late father \u2019s steward , to be his brother ? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking ? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? \u201d \u201c You can _ now _ have nothing further to say , \u201d she resentfully answered . \u201c You have insulted me , in every possible method . I must beg to return to the house . \u201d And she rose as she spoke . Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back . Her Ladyship was highly incensed . \u201c You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? \u201d \u201c Lady Catherine , I have nothing further to say . You know my sentiments . \u201d \u201c You are then resolved to have him ? \u201d \u201c I have said no such thing . I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _ you _ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . \u201d \u201c It is well . You refuse , then , to oblige me . You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . \u201d \u201c Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c has any possible claim on me , in the present instance . No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy . And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment \u2019s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . \u201d \u201c And this is your real opinion ! This is your final resolve ! Very well . I shall now know how to act . Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . I came to try you . I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . \u201d In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added,-- \u201c I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . I send no compliments to your mother . You deserve no such attention . I am most seriously displeased . \u201d Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her Ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs . Her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressing - room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . \u201c She did not choose it , \u201d said her daughter ; \u201c she would go . \u201d \u201c She is a very fine - looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . She is on her road somewhere , I dare say ; and so , passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? \u201d Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible
