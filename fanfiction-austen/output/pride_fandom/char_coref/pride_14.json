{"document": "XIV During dinner , Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . Lady Catherine de Bourgh \u2019s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better . Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise . The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner ; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people , he knew , but _ he _ had never seen anything but affability in her . She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations . She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs . \u201c That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , \u201c and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . Does she live near you , sir ? \u201d \u201c The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her Ladyship \u2019s residence . \u201d \u201c I think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? \u201d \u201c She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . \u201d \u201c Ah , \u201d cried Mrs. Bennet , shaking her head , \u201c then she is better off than many girls . And what sort of young lady is she ? Is she handsome ? \u201d \u201c She is a most charming young lady , indeed . Lady Catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of , as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . \u201d \u201c Has she been presented ? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . \u201d \u201c Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British Court of its brightest ornament . Her Ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess ; and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . \u201d \u201c You judge very properly , \u201d said Mr. Bennet ; \u201c and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? \u201d \u201c They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time ; and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . \u201d Mr. Bennet \u2019s expectations were fully answered . His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped ; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and , except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . By tea - time , however , the dose had been enough , and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him [ Illustration : \u201c Protested that he never read novels \u201d H.T Feb 94 ] to read aloud to the ladies . Mr. Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it ( for everything announced it to be from a circulating library ) he started back , and , begging pardon , protested that he never read novels . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose \u201c Fordyce \u2019s Sermons . \u201d Lydia gaped as he opened the volume ; and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with,-- \u201c Do you know , mamma , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard ? and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town . \u201d Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr. Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said,-- \u201c I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . It amazes me , I confess ; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . But I will no longer importune my young cousin . \u201d Then , turning to Mr. Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon . Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia \u2019s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr. Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill - will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .", "clusters":
