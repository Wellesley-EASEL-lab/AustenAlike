{"document": "XXI . The discussion of Mr. Collins \u2019s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . As for the gentleman himself , _ his _ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . He scarcely ever spoke to her ; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend . The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet \u2019s ill humour or ill health . Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton , to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . He joined them on their entering the town , and attended them to their aunt \u2019s , where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _ had _ been self - imposed . \u201c I found , \u201d said he , \u201c as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . \u201d She highly approved his forbearance ; and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her . His accompanying them was a double advantage : she felt all the compliment it offered to herself ; and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . [ Illustration : \u201c Walked back with them \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot - pressed paper , well covered with a lady \u2019s fair , flowing hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister \u2019s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . Jane recollected herself soon ; and putting the letter away , tried to join , with her usual cheerfulness , in the general conversation : but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs . When they had gained their own room , Jane , taking out her letter , said , \u201c This is from Caroline Bingley : what it contains has surprised me a good deal . The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . You shall hear what she says . \u201d She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street , where Mr. Hurst had a house . The next was in these words:--\u201c\u2018I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . I depend on you for that . \u2019 \u201d To these high - flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament : it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley \u2019s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his . \u201c It is unlucky , \u201d said she , after a short pause , \u201c that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . But may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them . \u201d \u201c Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . I will read it to you . \u201c \u2018 When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter : I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that I despair . I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you . \u2019 \u201c It is evident by this , \u201d added Jane , \u201c that he comes back no more this winter . \u201d \u201c It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . \u201d \u201c Why will you think so ? It must be his own doing ; he is his own master . But you do not know _ all _ . I _ will _ read you the passage which particularly hurts me . I will have no reserves from _ you _ . \u2018 Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and to confess the truth , _ we _ are scarcely less eager to meet her again . I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister \u2019s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman \u2019s heart . With all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? \u2019 What think you of _ this _ sentence , my dear Lizzy ? \u201d said Jane , as she finished it . \u201c Is it not clear enough ? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother \u2019s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard . Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? \u201d \u201c Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? \u201d \u201c Most willingly . \u201d \u201c You shall have it in a few words . Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . \u201d Jane shook her head . \u201c Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection ; Miss Bingley , I am sure , can not : she is not such a simpleton . Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ inter - marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . \u201d \u201c If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , \u201d replied Jane , \u201c your representation of all this might make me quite easy . But I know the foundation is unjust . Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . \u201d \u201c That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine : believe her to be deceived , by all means . You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . \u201d \u201c But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? \u201d \u201c You must decide for yourself , \u201d said Elizabeth ; \u201c and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you , by all means , to refuse him . \u201d \u201c How can you talk so ? \u201d said Jane , faintly smiling ; \u201c you must know , that , though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . \u201d \u201c I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . \u201d \u201c But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . A thousand things may arise in six months . \u201d The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline \u2019s interested wishes ; and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone . She represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . Jane \u2019s temper was not desponding ; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart . They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman \u2019s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together . After lamenting it , however , at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again , and soon dining at Longbourn ; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [17, 18], "text":
