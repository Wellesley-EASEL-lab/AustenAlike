{"document": "XXX . Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter \u2019s being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . While Sir William was with them , Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and showing him the country : but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration ; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . The room in which the ladies sat was backwards . Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect : but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . From the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes \u2019 conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins \u2019s joints of meat were too large for her family . Elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty . [ Illustration : \u201c he never failed to inform them \u201d ] The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card - table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first . Their other engagements were few , as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses \u2019 reach . This , however , was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough : there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine \u2019s curiosity . In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . Elizabeth had heard , soon after her arrival , that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks ; and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley \u2019s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage ; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have [ Illustration : \u201c The gentlemen accompanied him . \u201d [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] the earliest assurance of it ; and , after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence . On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord ---- ; and , to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr. Collins returned , the gentlemen accompanied him . Charlotte had seen them from her husband \u2019s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding,-- \u201c I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . \u201d Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs. Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . Elizabeth merely courtesied to him , without saying a word . Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly , with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins , sat for some time without speaking to anybody . At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . She answered him in the usual way ; and , after a moment \u2019s pause , added,-- \u201c My eldest sister has been in town these three months . Have you never happened to see her there ? \u201d She was perfectly sensible that he never had : but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . The subject was pursued no further , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .
