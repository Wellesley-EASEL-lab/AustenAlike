{"document": "LXI . Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley , and talked of Mrs. Darcy , may be guessed . I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though , perhaps , it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do . He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart . The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified : he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire ; and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia ; and , removed from the influence of Lydia \u2019s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid . From the further disadvantage of Lydia \u2019s society she was of course carefully kept ; and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet \u2019s being quite unable to sit alone . Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters \u2019 beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance . As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters . He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and , in spite of everything , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . The letter was to this effect:-- / * \u201c My dear Lizzy , * / \u201c I wish you joy . If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . It is a great comfort to have you so rich ; and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not . \u201c Yours , \u201d etc . As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind . Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses , she frequently sent them . It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills . Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought . His affection for her soon sunk into indifference : hers lasted a little longer ; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . Though Darcy could never receive _ him _ at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth \u2019s sake , he assisted him further in his profession . Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long , that even Bingley \u2019s good - humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _ talk _ of giving them a hint to be gone . Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy \u2019s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropped all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth . Pemberley was now Georgiana \u2019s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive manner of talking to her brother . He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . By Elizabeth \u2019s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . But at length , by Elizabeth \u2019s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms . Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [5, 6], "text": "her"}, {"position": [13, 15], "text": "Mrs. Bennet"}, {"position": [18, 19], "text": "her"}, {"position": [28, 29], "text": "she"},
