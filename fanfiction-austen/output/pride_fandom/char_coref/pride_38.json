{"document": "XXXVIII . On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary . \u201c I know not , Miss Elizabeth , \u201d said he , \u201c whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly . \u201d Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attention she had received , must make _ her _ feel the obliged . Mr. Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,-- \u201c It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine \u2019s family is , indeed , the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth , I must acknowledge , that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . \u201d Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences . \u201c You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . I flatter myself , at least , that you will be able to do so . Lady Catherine \u2019s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . We seem to have been designed for each other . \u201d Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add , that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang . Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms . At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins ; and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , though unknown . He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . \u201c But , \u201d he added , \u201c you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . \u201d Elizabeth made no objection : the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . \u201c Good gracious ! \u201d cried Maria , after a few minutes \u2019 silence , \u201c it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! \u201d \u201c A great many indeed , \u201d said her companion , with a sigh . \u201c We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! \u201d Elizabeth privately added , \u201c And how much I shall have to conceal ! \u201d Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner \u2019s house , where they were to remain a few days . Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . It was not without an effort , meanwhile , that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy \u2019s proposals . To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister further .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [7, 9], "text": "Mr.
