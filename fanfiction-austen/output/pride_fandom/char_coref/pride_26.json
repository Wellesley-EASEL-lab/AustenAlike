{"document": "XXVI . Mrs. Gardiner \u2019s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone : after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on:-- \u201c You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him , in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . I have nothing to say against _ him _ : he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . But as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you . You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . Your father would depend on _ your _ resolution and good conduct , I am sure . You must not disappoint your father . \u201d \u201c My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . \u201d \u201c Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . \u201d \u201c Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . I will take care of myself , and of Mr. Wickham too . He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . \u201d \u201c Elizabeth , you are not serious now . \u201d \u201c I beg your pardon . I will try again . At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be better that he should not . I see the imprudence of it . Oh , _ that _ abominable Mr. Darcy ! My father \u2019s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it . My father , however , is partial to Mr. Wickham . In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see , every day , that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld , by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow - creatures , if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wiser to resist ? All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . In short , I will do my best . \u201d \u201c Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often . At least you should not _ remind _ your mother of inviting him . \u201d \u201c As I did the other day , \u201d said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; \u201c very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _ that _ . But do not imagine that he is always here so often . It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . You know my mother \u2019s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now I hope you are satisfied . \u201d Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth , having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented . Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but , as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet . His marriage was now fast approaching ; and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say , in an ill - natured tone , that she \u201c _ wished _ they might be happy . \u201d Thursday was to be the wedding - day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother \u2019s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said,-- \u201c I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . \u201d \u201c _ That _ you certainly shall . \u201d \u201c And I have another favour to ask . Will you come and see me ? \u201d \u201c We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . \u201d \u201c I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . \u201d Elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit . \u201c My father and Maria are to come to me in March , \u201d added Charlotte , \u201c and I hope you will consent to be of the party . Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . \u201d The wedding took place : the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door , and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . Elizabeth soon heard from her friend , and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been : that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over ; and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was . Charlotte \u2019s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness : there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine \u2019s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . It was Mr. Collins \u2019s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . Jane had already written a few lines to her sister , to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost . \u201c My aunt , \u201d she continued , \u201c is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street . \u201d She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley . \u201c I did not think Caroline in spirits , \u201d were her words , \u201c but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . I inquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner : I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall soon see them here . \u201d Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister \u2019s being in town . Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley \u2019s inattention . After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and , yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- \u201c My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley \u2019s regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was , in every respect , so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming , her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there . \u201c Yours , etc . \u201d This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned , as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . His character sunk on every review of it ; and , as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy \u2019s sister , as , by Wickham \u2019s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _ she _ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte \u2019s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and , while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner ; and , after relating the circumstances , she thus went on:--\u201cI am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . But my feelings are not only cordial towards _ him _ , they are even impartial towards Miss King . I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . There can be no love in all this . My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do . They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain . \u201d [ Illustration : \u201c On
