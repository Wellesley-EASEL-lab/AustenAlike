{"document": "LIX . \u201c My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? \u201d was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge . She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . The evening passed quietly , unmarked by anything extraordinary . The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed ; the unacknowledged were silent . Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known : she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _ dislike _ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . At night she opened her heart to Jane . Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet \u2019s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . \u201c You are joking , Lizzy . This can not be ! Engaged to Mr. Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . \u201d \u201c This is a wretched beginning , indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . I speak nothing but the truth . He still loves me , and we are engaged . \u201d Jane looked at her doubtingly . \u201c Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be . I know how much you dislike him . \u201d \u201c You know nothing of the matter . _ That _ is all to be forgot . Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable . This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . \u201d Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . Elizabeth again , and more seriously , assured her of its truth . \u201c Good heaven ! can it be really so ? Yet now I must believe you , \u201d cried Jane . \u201c My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? \u201d \u201c There can be no doubt of that . It is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . But are you pleased , Jane ? Shall you like to have such a brother ? \u201d \u201c Very , very much . Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . And do you really love him quite well enough ? Oh , Lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection . Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? \u201d \u201c Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do when I tell you all . \u201d \u201c What do you mean ? \u201d \u201c Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . I am afraid you will be angry . \u201d \u201c My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious . I want to talk very seriously . Let me know everything that I am to know without delay . Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? \u201d \u201c It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began ; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . \u201d Another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish . \u201c Now I am quite happy , \u201d said she , \u201c for you will be as happy as myself . I always had a value for him . Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley \u2019s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . But , Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . \u201d Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend : but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia \u2019s marriage . All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . \u201c Good gracious ! \u201d cried Mrs. Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , \u201c if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . What shall we do with him ? Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley \u2019s way . \u201d Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , \u201c Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? \u201d \u201c I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , \u201d said Mrs. Bennet , \u201c to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . \u201d \u201c It may do very well for the others , \u201d replied Mr. Bingley ; \u201c but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . Wo n\u2019t it , Kitty ? \u201d Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . As she went upstairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying,-- \u201c I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it . It is all for Jane \u2019s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . \u201d During their walk , it was resolved that Mr. Bennet \u2019s consent should be asked in the course of the evening : Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother \u2019s . She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man ; but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation . In the evening , soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . She did not fear her father \u2019s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means ; that _ she _ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , \u201c Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . \u201d She was gone directly . Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . \u201c Lizzy , \u201d said he , \u201c what are you doing ? Are you out of your senses to be accepting this man ? Have not you always hated him ? \u201d How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr. Darcy . \u201c Or , in other words , you are determined to have him . He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . But will they make you happy ? \u201d \u201c Have you any other objection , \u201d said Elizabeth , \u201c than your belief of my indifference ? \u201d \u201c None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . \u201d \u201c I do , I do like him , \u201d she replied , with tears in her eyes ; \u201c I love him . Indeed he has no improper pride . He is perfectly amiable . You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . \u201d \u201c Lizzy , \u201d said her father , \u201c I have given him my consent . He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask . I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . But let me advise you to think better of it . I know your disposition , Lizzy . I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior . Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . My child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life . You know not what you are about . \u201d Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and , at length , by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months \u2019 suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father \u2019s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . \u201c Well , my dear , \u201d said he , when she ceased speaking , \u201c I have no more to say . If this be the case , he deserves you . I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . \u201d To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . He heard her with astonishment . \u201c This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! And so , Darcy did everything ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow \u2019s debts , and got him his commission ! So much the better . It will save me a world of trouble and economy . Had it been your uncle \u2019s doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way . I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . \u201d He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading Mr. Collins \u2019s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go , saying , as she quitted the room , \u201c If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . \u201d Elizabeth \u2019s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour \u2019s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . Everything was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . When her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . Its effect was most extraordinary ; for , on first hearing it , Mrs. Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard , though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . \u201c Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr. Darcy ! Who would have thought it ? And is it really true ? Oh , my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane \u2019s is nothing to it -- nothing at all . I am so pleased -- so happy . Such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before . I hope he will overlook it . Dear , dear Lizzy . A house in town ! Everything that is charming ! Three daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! what will become of me ? I shall go distracted . \u201d This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted ; and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . \u201c My dearest child , \u201d she cried , \u201c I can think of nothing else . Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! \u2019 Tis as good as a lord ! And a special licence -- you must and shall be married by a special licence . But , my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . \u201d This was a sad omen of what her mother \u2019s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations \u2019 consent , there was still something to be wished for . But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . \u201c I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , \u201d said he . \u201c Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane \u2019s . \u201d", "clusters": [{"mentions":
