{"document": "XVII . Elizabeth related to Jane , the next day , what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself . Jane listened with astonishment and concern : she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley \u2019s regard ; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained . \u201c They have both , \u201d said she , \u201c been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . \u201d \u201c Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear _ them _ , too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . \u201d \u201c Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father \u2019s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? Oh no . \u201d \u201c I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley \u2019s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it . Besides , there was truth in his looks . \u201d \u201c It is difficult , indeed -- it is distressing . One does not know what to think . \u201d \u201c I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . \u201d But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley , if he _ had been _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery , where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet \u2019s civilities . The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy \u2019s look and behaviour . The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person ; for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball . And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . \u201c While I can have my mornings to myself , \u201d said she , \u201c it is enough . I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . \u201d Elizabeth \u2019s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley \u2019s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening \u2019s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke , either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance . \u201c I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , \u201d said he , \u201c that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ; a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . \u201d Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed . There was no help for it , however . Mr. Wickham \u2019s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer , and Mr. Collins \u2019s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could . She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that _ she _ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _ her _ . Elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . Mr. Collins might never make the offer , and , till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time ; for , from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe - roses for Netherfield were got by proxy . Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [18, 19], "text": "herself"},
