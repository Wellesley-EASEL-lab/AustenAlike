{"document": "XI . When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room , where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . Their powers of conversation were considerable . They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley \u2019s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation ; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was \u201c very glad ; \u201d but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley \u2019s salutation . He was full of joy and attention . The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed , at his desire , to the other side of the fireplace , that she might be farther from the door . He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to anyone else . Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight . When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table -- but in vain . She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards , and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected . She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her . Mr. Hurst had , therefore , nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep . Darcy took up a book . Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs. Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother \u2019s conversation with Miss Bennet . Miss Bingley \u2019s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy \u2019s progress through _ his _ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . She could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question and read on . At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , \u201c How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare , after all , there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . \u201d No one made any reply . She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when , hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said,-- \u201c By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . \u201d \u201c If you mean Darcy , \u201d cried her brother , \u201c he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . \u201d \u201c I should like balls infinitely better , \u201d she replied , \u201c if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . \u201d \u201c Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say ; but it would not be near so much like a ball . \u201d Miss Bingley made no answer , and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . In the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said,-- \u201c Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . \u201d Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility : Mr. Darcy looked up . He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere . What could he mean ? She was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him . \u201c Not at all , \u201d was her answer ; \u201c but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it . \u201d Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything , and persevered , therefore , in requiring an explanation of his two motives . \u201c I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , \u201d said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . \u201c You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other \u2019s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . \u201d \u201c Oh , shocking ! \u201d cried Miss Bingley . \u201c I never heard anything so abominable . How shall we punish him for such a speech ? \u201d \u201c Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c We can all plague and punish one another . Tease him -- laugh at him . Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . \u201d \u201c But upon my honour I do _ not _ . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ . Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind ! No , no ; I feel he may defy us there . And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Mr. Darcy may hug himself . \u201d \u201c Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintance . I dearly love a laugh . \u201d \u201c Miss Bingley , \u201d said he , \u201c has given me credit for more than can be . The wisest and best of men,--nay , the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . \u201d \u201c Certainly , \u201d replied Elizabeth , \u201c there are such people , but I hope I am not one of _ them _ . I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _ do _ divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . \u201d \u201c Perhaps that is not possible for anyone . But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . \u201d \u201c Such as vanity and pride . \u201d \u201c Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind -- pride will be always under good regulation . \u201d Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . \u201c Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , \u201d said Miss Bingley ; \u201c and pray what is the result ? \u201d \u201c I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . He owns it himself without disguise . \u201d \u201c No , \u201d said Darcy , \u201c I have made no such pretension . I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . My temper I dare not vouch for . It is , I believe , too little yielding ; certainly too little for the convenience of the world . I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . \u201d \u201c _ That _ is a failing , indeed ! \u201d cried Elizabeth . \u201c Implacable resentment _ is _ a shade in a character . But you have chosen your fault well . I really can not _ laugh _ at it . You are safe from me . \u201d \u201c There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . \u201d \u201c And _ your _ defect is a propensity to hate everybody . \u201d \u201c And yours , \u201d he replied , with a smile , \u201c is wilfully to misunderstand them . \u201d \u201c Do let us have a little music , \u201d cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . \u201c Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . \u201d Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened ; and Darcy , after a few moments \u2019 recollection , was not sorry for it . He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [8, 9], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [12, 13], "text": "her"}, {"position": [12,
