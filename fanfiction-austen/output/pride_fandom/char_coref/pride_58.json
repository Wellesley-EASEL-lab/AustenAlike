{"document": "LVIII . Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine \u2019s visit . The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . It was agreed to . Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them . They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy were to entertain each other . Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and , perhaps , he might be doing the same . They walked towards the Lucases \u2019 , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone . Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed ; and while her courage was high , she immediately said,-- \u201c Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours . I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . Were it known to the rest of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . \u201d \u201c I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , \u201d replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , \u201c that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . \u201d \u201c You must not blame my aunt . Lydia \u2019s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . \u201d \u201c If you _ will _ thank me , \u201d he replied , \u201c let it be for yourself alone . That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . But your _ family _ owe me nothing . Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of _ you _ . \u201d Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . After a short pause , her companion added , \u201c You are too generous to trifle with me . If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . _ My _ affections and wishes are unchanged ; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . \u201d Elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances . The happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him : but though she could not look she could listen ; and he told her of feelings which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . They walked on without knowing in what direction . There was too much to be thought , and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _ did _ call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her Ladyship \u2019s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _ she _ had refused to give . But , unluckily for her Ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise . \u201c It taught me to hope , \u201d said he , \u201c as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly . \u201d Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , \u201c Yes , you know enough of my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that _ . After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . \u201d \u201c What did you say of me that I did not deserve ? For though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . It was unpardonable . I can not think of it without abhorrence . \u201d \u201c We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then we have both , I hope , improved in civility . \u201d \u201c I can not be so easily reconciled to myself . The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : \u2018 Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . \u2019 Those were your words . You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . \u201d \u201c I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . \u201d \u201c I can easily believe it . You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . \u201d \u201c Oh , do not repeat what I then said . These recollections will not do at all . I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . \u201d Darcy mentioned his letter . \u201c Did it , \u201d said he,--\u201cdid it _ soon _ make you think better of me ? Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? \u201d She explained what its effects on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . \u201c I knew , \u201d said he , \u201c that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . I hope you have destroyed the letter . There was one part , especially the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . \u201d \u201c The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . \u201d \u201c When I wrote that letter , \u201d replied Darcy , \u201c I believed myself perfectly calm and cool ; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . \u201d \u201c The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . The adieu is charity itself . But think no more of the letter . The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . You must learn some of my philosophy . Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . \u201d \u201c I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . _ Your _ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of ignorance . But with _ me _ , it is not so . Painful recollections will intrude , which can not , which ought not to be repelled . I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only _ child _ ) , I was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _ wish _ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight - and - twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . By you , I was properly humbled . I came to you without a doubt of my reception . You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . \u201d \u201c Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? \u201d \u201c Indeed I had . What will you think of my vanity ? I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . \u201d \u201c My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I assure you . I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . How you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ! \u201d \u201c Hate you ! I was angry , perhaps , at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . \u201d \u201c I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley . You blamed me for coming ? \u201d \u201c No , indeed , I felt nothing but surprise . \u201d \u201c Your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you . My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . \u201d \u201c My object _ then _ , \u201d replied Darcy , \u201c was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . How soon any other wishes introduced themselves , I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . \u201d He then told her of Georgiana \u2019s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther . After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know anything about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home . \u201c What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ? \u201d was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _ their _ affairs . Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . \u201c I must ask whether you were surprised ? \u201d said Elizabeth . \u201c Not at all . When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . \u201d \u201c That is to say , you had given your permission . I guessed as much . \u201d And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case . \u201c On the evening before my going to London , \u201d said he , \u201c I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . His surprise was great . He had never had the slightest suspicion . I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . \u201d Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . \u201c Did you speak from your own observation , \u201d said she , \u201c when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? \u201d \u201c From the former . I had narrowly observed her , during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . \u201d \u201c And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . \u201d \u201c It did . Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made everything easy . I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . He was angry . But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister \u2019s sentiments . He has heartily forgiven me now . \u201d Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin . In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . In the hall they parted .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [11, 12], "text": "his"}, {"position": [18, 20], "text": "Mr. Bingley"}, {"position": [23, 24], "text": "he"}, {"position": [28,
