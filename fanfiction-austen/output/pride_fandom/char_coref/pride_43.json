{"document": "XLIII . Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent . Elizabeth \u2019s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of the valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . It was a large , handsome stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned . Elizabeth was delighted . She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned . She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . The housekeeper came ; a respectable looking elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . They followed her into the dining - parlour . It was a large , well - proportioned room , handsomely fitted up . Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . The hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine,--with less of splendour , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . \u201c And of this place , \u201d thought she , \u201c I might have been mistress ! With these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted ! Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But , no , \u201d recollecting herself , \u201c that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them . \u201d This was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret . She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs. Reynolds replied , that he was ; adding , \u201c But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . \u201d How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantel - piece . Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master \u2019s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expense . \u201c He is now gone into the army , \u201d she added ; \u201c but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . \u201d Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . \u201c And that , \u201d said Mrs. Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , \u201c is my master -- and very like him . It was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago . \u201d \u201c I have heard much of your master \u2019s fine person , \u201d said Mrs. Gardiner , looking at the picture ; \u201c it is a handsome face . But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . \u201d Mrs. Reynolds \u2019 respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master . \u201c Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? \u201d Elizabeth coloured , and said , \u201c A little . \u201d \u201c And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma\u2019am ? \u201d \u201c Yes , very handsome . \u201d \u201c I am sure _ I _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . This room was my late master \u2019s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . He was very fond of them . \u201d This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham \u2019s being among them . Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . \u201c And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? \u201d said Mr. Gardiner . \u201c Oh , yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She plays and sings all day long . In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master : she comes here to - morrow with him . \u201d Mr. Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks : Mrs. Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . \u201c Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? \u201d \u201c Not so much as I could wish , sir : but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . \u201d \u201c Except , \u201d thought Elizabeth , \u201c when she goes to Ramsgate . \u201d \u201c If your master would marry , you might see more of him . \u201d \u201c Yes , sir ; but I do not know when _ that _ will be . I do not know who is good enough for him . \u201d Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled . Elizabeth could not help saying , \u201c It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . \u201d \u201c I say no more than the truth , and what everybody will say that knows him , \u201d replied the other . Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , \u201c I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . \u201d This was praise of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . That he was not a good - tempered man had been her firmest opinion . Her keenest attention was awakened : she longed to hear more ; and was grateful to her uncle for saying,-- \u201c There are very few people of whom so much can be said . You are lucky in having such a master . \u201d \u201c Yes , sir , I know I am . If I were to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world . \u201d Elizabeth almost stared at her . \u201c Can this be Mr. Darcy ? \u201d thought she . \u201c His father was an excellent man , \u201d said Mrs. Gardiner . \u201c Yes , ma\u2019am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . \u201d Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point . She related the subjects of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture in vain . Mr. Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . \u201c He is the best landlord , and the best master , \u201d said she , \u201c that ever lived . Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw anything of it . To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . \u201d \u201c In what an amiable light does this place him ! \u201d thought Elizabeth . \u201c This fine account of him , \u201d whispered her aunt as they walked , \u201c is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . \u201d \u201c Perhaps we might be deceived . \u201d \u201c That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . \u201d On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shown into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . \u201c He is certainly a good brother , \u201d said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy \u2019s delight , when she should enter the room . \u201c And this is always the way with him , \u201d she added . \u201c Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . There is nothing he would not do for her . \u201d The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed - rooms , were all that remained to be shown . In the former were many good paintings : but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy \u2019s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . At last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . She stood several minutes before the picture , in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . Mrs. Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father \u2019s lifetime . There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth \u2019s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature . What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people \u2019s happiness were in his guardianship ! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! How much of good or evil must be done by him ! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character ; and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before : she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs ; and , taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also ; and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables . They were within twenty yards of each other ; and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . She had instinctively turned away ; but stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy , the gardener \u2019s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family . Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . She was overpowered by shame and vexation . Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged thing in the world ! How strange must it appear to him ! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! Oh ! why did she come ? or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination ; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . And his behaviour , so strikingly altered,--what could it mean ? That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility , to inquire after her family ! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! She knew not what to think , or how to account for it . They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching : but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr. Darcy then was . She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him . Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _ that _ in his voice , which was not like ease . Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . They entered the woods , and , bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , and one of its narrowest parts . They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene : it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it . Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs. Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr. Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth \u2019s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words \u201c delightful , \u201d and \u201c charming , \u201d when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed . Her colour changed , and she said no more . Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself . \u201c What will be his surprise , \u201d thought she , \u201c when he knows who they are ! He takes them now for people of fashion . \u201d The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . That he was _ surprised _ by the connection was evident : he sustained it , however , with fortitude : and , so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner . Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . The conversation soon turned upon fishing ; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . Mrs. Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , \u201c Why is he so altered ? From what can it proceed ? It can not be for _ me _ , it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . It is impossible that he should still love me . \u201d After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . It originated in Mrs. Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth \u2019s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband \u2019s . Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . After a short silence the lady first spoke . She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected--\u201cfor your housekeeper , \u201d she added , \u201c informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and , indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . \u201d He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . \u201c They will join me early to - morrow , \u201d he continued , \u201c and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr . Bingley and his sisters . \u201d Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley \u2019s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _ his _ mind was not very differently engaged . \u201c There is also one other person in the party , \u201d he continued after a pause , \u201c who more particularly wishes to be known to you . Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? \u201d The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind . They soon outstripped the others ; and when they had reached the carriage , Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . He then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . At such a time much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject . At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with great perseverance . Yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _ t\u00eate - \u00e0 - t\u00eate _ was over . On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner \u2019s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage ; and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected . \u201c He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , \u201d said her uncle . \u201c There _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , \u201d replied her aunt ; \u201c but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _ I _ have seen nothing of it . \u201d \u201c I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . \u201d \u201c To be sure , Lizzy , \u201d said her aunt , \u201c he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham \u2019s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? \u201d Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could : said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . \u201c But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , \u201d replied her uncle . \u201c Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . \u201d Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . \u201c From what we have seen of him , \u201d continued Mrs. Gardiner , \u201c I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham . He has not an ill - natured look . On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . But , to be sure , the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character ! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and _ that _ , in the eye of a servant , comprehends every virtue . \u201d Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and , therefore , gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham \u2019s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned : but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of anything else . Fatigued as she had been by the morning \u2019s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years \u2019 discontinuance . The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr. Darcy \u2019s civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [2, 3], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [32, 33], "text": "her"},
