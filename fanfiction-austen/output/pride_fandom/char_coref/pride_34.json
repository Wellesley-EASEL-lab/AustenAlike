{"document": "XXXIV . When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards everyone , had been scarcely ever clouded . Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . Mr. Darcy \u2019s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister \u2019s sufferings . It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . She could not think of Darcy \u2019s leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and , agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door - bell ; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to inquire particularly after her . But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room . In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . She answered him with cold civility . He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . After a silence of several minutes , he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began:-- \u201c In vain have I struggled . It will not do . My feelings will not be repressed . You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . \u201d Elizabeth \u2019s astonishment was beyond expression . She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed . He spoke well ; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . His sense of her inferiority , of its being a degradation , of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . In spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man \u2019s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger . She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . He _ spoke _ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther ; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said,-- \u201c In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could _ feel _ gratitude , I would now thank you . But I cannot -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . \u201d Mr. Darcy , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . His complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature . He was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it . The pause was to Elizabeth \u2019s feelings dreadful . At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said,-- \u201c And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _ endeavour _ at civility , I am thus rejected . But it is of small importance . \u201d \u201c I might as well inquire , \u201d replied she , \u201c why , with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _ was _ uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? \u201d As she pronounced these words , Mr. Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued,-- \u201c I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _ there _ . You dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . \u201d She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse . He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . \u201c Can you deny that you have done it ? \u201d she repeated . With assumed tranquillity he then replied , \u201c I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . Towards _ him _ I have been kinder than towards myself . \u201d Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her . \u201c But it is not merely this affair , \u201d she continued , \u201c on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . On this subject , what can you have to say ? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ? \u201d \u201c You take an eager interest in that gentleman \u2019s concerns , \u201d said Darcy , in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . \u201c Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him ? \u201d \u201c His misfortunes ! \u201d repeated Darcy , contemptuously,--\u201cyes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . \u201d \u201c And of your infliction , \u201d cried Elizabeth , with energy ; \u201c You have reduced him to his present state of poverty -- comparative poverty . You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him . You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . You have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . \u201d \u201c And this , \u201d cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , \u201c is your opinion of me ! This is the estimation in which you hold me ! I thank you for explaining it so fully . My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! But , perhaps , \u201d added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , \u201c these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I , with greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by everything . But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? \u201d Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,-- \u201c You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . \u201d She saw him start at this ; but he said nothing , and she continued,-- \u201c You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . \u201d Again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification . She went on,-- \u201c From the very beginning , from the first moment , I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . \u201d \u201c You have said quite enough , madam . I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . \u201d And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . She knew not how to support herself , and , from actual weakness , sat down and cried for half an hour . Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy ! that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend \u2019s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine \u2019s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte \u2019s observation , and hurried her away to her room .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [7, 8], "text": "Elizabeth"}, {"position": [14, 15], "text": "herself"}, {"position": [25, 26], "text": "her"}, {"position": [38, 39], "text": "her"},
