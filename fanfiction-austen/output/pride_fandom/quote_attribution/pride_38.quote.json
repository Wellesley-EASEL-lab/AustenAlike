The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly . \u201d"}, {"position": [234, 393], "text": "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine \u2019s family is , indeed , the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth , I must acknowledge , that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . \u201d"}], "Elizabeth": [{"position": [428, 576], "text": "You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin .

Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .
