You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother \u2019s permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . \u201d"}], "Mr. Collins": [{"position": [162, 197], "text": "Oh dear !

I desire you will stay where you are . \u201d"}, {"position": [597, 1170], "text": "My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh \u2019s footstool,--that she said , \u2018 Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake , and for your _ own _ ; let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . \u2019 Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother \u2019s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . \u201d"}, {"position": [1180, 1188], "text": "You are too hasty , sir , \u201d"}, {"position": [1192, 1247], "text": "You forget that I have made no answer .

My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration that , in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . Your portion is unhappily so small , that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . As I must , therefore , conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . \u201d"}, {"position": [2015, 2118], "text": "I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .
