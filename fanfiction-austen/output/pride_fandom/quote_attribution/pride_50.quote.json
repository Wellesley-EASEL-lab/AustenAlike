And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece \u2019s . It is Mr. Wickham \u2019s intention to go into the Regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General---- \u2019s regiment , now quartered in the north . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information ? He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Yours , etc . \u201c E.
