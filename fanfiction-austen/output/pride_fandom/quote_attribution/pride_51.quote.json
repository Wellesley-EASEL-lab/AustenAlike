But I must tell you how it went off . We were married , you know , at St. Clement \u2019s , because Wickham \u2019s lodgings were in that parish . And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o\u2019clock . My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . \u201c Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . \u201c Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual : I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . If you \u2019ll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . Not one party , or scheme , or anything ! To be sure , London was rather thin , but , however , the Little Theatre was open . \u201c Well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone . And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes \u2019 time , and then we all set out . However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . \u201d"}, {"position": [2003, 2058], "text": "Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know .
