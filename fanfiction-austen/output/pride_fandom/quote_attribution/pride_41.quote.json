I have no such injuries to resent . It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia \u2019s character . Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . Her character will be fixed ; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . She will follow wherever Lydia leads . Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! Oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? \u201d"}, {"position": [1187, 1361], "text": "Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .
