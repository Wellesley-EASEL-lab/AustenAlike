If there were anyone that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head .

Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be , of all others , most afflicting to a parent \u2019s mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others : for who , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? And this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . Let me advise you , then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . \u201c I am , dear sir , \u201d"}, {"position": [1648, 1652], "text": "A gamester ! \u201d"}, {"position": [1656, 1670], "text": "This is wholly unexpected ; I had not an idea of it . \u201d"}, {"position": [1778, 1791], "text": "What ! is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ? \u201d"}, {"position": [1795, 1825], "text": "Sure he will not leave London before he has found them .
