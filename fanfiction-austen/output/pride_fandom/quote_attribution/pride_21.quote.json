I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister \u2019s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman \u2019s heart .

Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter : I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that I despair .
