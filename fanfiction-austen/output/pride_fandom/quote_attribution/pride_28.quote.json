She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her Ladyship \u2019s carriage is regularly ordered for us . I _ should _ say , one of her Ladyship \u2019s carriages , for she has several . \u201d"}], "Charlotte": [{"position": [1036, 1049], "text": "Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , \u201d"}, {"position": [1053, 1060], "text": "and a most attentive neighbour . \u201d"}, {"position": [1061, 1091], "text": "Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say .
