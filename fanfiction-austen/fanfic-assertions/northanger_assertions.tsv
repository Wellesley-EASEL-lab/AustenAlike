Character	Assertion
Catherine Morland	16 Catherine ’s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable ; and accordingly , though she was most politely received by General Tilney , and kindly welcomed by his daughter , though Henry was at home , and no one else of the party , she found , on her return , without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings , that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded .
Catherine Morland	Instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney
Catherine Morland	, from the intercourse of the day , she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before ; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever , in the ease of a family party , he had never said so little , nor been so little agreeable ; and , in spite of their father ’s great civilities to her — in spite of his thanks , invitations , and compliments — it had been a release to get away from him .
Catherine Morland	It puzzled her to account for all this .
Catherine Morland	_ He _ could not be accountable for his children ’s want of spirits , or for her want of enjoyment in his company .
Catherine Morland	The former she hoped at last might have been accidental , and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity .
Catherine Morland	she had long suspected the family to be very high , and this made it certain .
Catherine Morland	Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney ’s she had never heard of in her life !
Catherine Morland	and then the brother , he , who had appeared so attached to you !
Catherine Morland	And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I do not say so ; but he did not seem in good spirits . ”
Catherine Morland	Let me entreat you never to think of him again , my dear Catherine ; indeed he is unworthy of you . ”
Catherine Morland	i do not suppose he ever thinks of me . ”
Catherine Morland	“ That is exactly what I say ; he never thinks of you .
Catherine Morland	how different to your brother and to mine !
Catherine Morland	“ But as for General Tilney , I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention ; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy . ”
Catherine Morland	i know no harm of him ; I do not suspect him of pride .
Catherine Morland	I believe he is a very gentleman - like man .
Catherine Morland	John thinks very well of him , and John ’s judgment — ” “ Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And must I go ? ” “ Do not you intend it ?
Catherine Morland	“ Nay , since you make such a point of it , I can refuse you nothing .
Catherine Morland	But do not insist upon my being very agreeable , for my heart , you know , will be some forty miles off .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , meanwhile , undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil , or of any evil at all , except that of having but a short set to dance down , enjoyed her usual happiness with Henry Tilney , listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said ; and , in finding him irresistible , becoming so herself .
Catherine Morland	At the end of the first dance , Captain Tilney came towards them again , and , much to Catherine ’s dissatisfaction , pulled his brother away .
Catherine Morland	They retired whispering together ; and , though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm , and lay it down as fact , that Captain Tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her , which he now hastened to communicate to his brother , in the hope of separating them forever , she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations .
Catherine Morland	Her suspense was of full five minutes ’ duration ; and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour , when they both returned , and an explanation was given , by Henry ’s requesting to know , if she thought her friend , Miss Thorpe , would have any objection to dancing , as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , without hesitation , replied that she was very sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all .
Catherine Morland	“ Your brother will not mind it , I know , ” said she , “ because I heard him say before that he hated dancing ; but it was very good - natured in him to think of it .
Catherine Morland	Henry smiled , and said , “ How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people ’s actions . ” “ Why ?
Catherine Morland	“ With you , it is not , How is such a one likely to be influenced , What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person ’s feelings , age , situation , and probable habits of life considered — but , How should _ I _ be influenced , What would be _ my _ inducement in acting so and so ?
Catherine Morland	“ I do not understand you . ” “ Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Me ?
Catherine Morland	Yes ; I can not speak well enough to be unintelligible . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But pray tell me what you mean . ”
Catherine Morland	Do you really desire it ?
Catherine Morland	But you are not aware of the consequences
Catherine Morland	; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment , and certainly bring on a disagreement between us . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , no ; it shall not do either ; I am not afraid . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine blushed and disclaimed , and the gentleman ’s predictions were verified .
Catherine Morland	There was a something , however , in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion ; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time , forgetting to speak or to listen , and almost forgetting where she was ; till , roused by the voice of Isabella , she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across .
Catherine Morland	Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled , the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given ; but as it was not quite enough for Catherine ’s comprehension , she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner .
Catherine Morland	but , because — And your brother !
Catherine Morland	after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ” “ I can not take surprise to myself on that head .
Catherine Morland	You bid me be surprised on your friend ’s account , and therefore I am ; but
Catherine Morland	The fairness of your friend was an open attraction ; her firmness , you know , could only be understood by yourself . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . ”
Catherine Morland	The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle !
Catherine Morland	it would have looked so particular ; and you know how I abhor doing that .
Catherine Morland	You have no idea how he pressed me .
Catherine Morland	Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening .
Catherine Morland	I took him down several times , you know , in my way . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled .
Catherine Morland	For myself , it is nothing ; I never think of myself . ” “ I know you never do , my dear ; and you will always find your reward in
Catherine Morland	the affection it makes everybody feel for you
Catherine Morland	There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child — but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things .
Catherine Morland	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine was hurt by these insinuations .
Catherine Morland	“ I am very sure , ” said she , “ that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford . ”
Catherine Morland	“ As to that , my sweet Catherine , there can not be a doubt , and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me .
Catherine Morland	my Catherine , you have found me out .
Catherine Morland	The long , long , endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , yes , my darling Isabella , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , “ we perfectly see into your heart .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen .
Catherine Morland	She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella ’s regret ; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever , endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise .
Catherine Morland	15 Early the next day , a note from Isabella , speaking peace and tenderness in every line , and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance , hastened Catherine , in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity , to Edgar ’s Buildings .
Catherine Morland	The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour ; and , on Anne ’s quitting it to call her sister , Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday ’s party .
Catherine Morland	Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it ; and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world , that nobody could imagine how charming it had been , and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive . Such was the information of the first five minutes ; the second unfolded thus much in detail — that they had driven directly to the York Hotel , ate some soup , and bespoke an early dinner , walked down to the pump - room , tasted the water , and laid out some shillings in purses and spars ; thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry - cook ’s , and hurrying back to the hotel , swallowed their dinner in haste , to prevent being in the dark ; and then had a delightful drive back , only the moon was not up , and it rained a little , and Mr. Morland ’s horse was so tired he could hardly get it along .
Catherine Morland	Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction .
Catherine Morland	Maria was without ceremony sent away , and Isabella , embracing Catherine , thus began : “ Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you .
Catherine Morland	Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance .
Catherine Morland	“ Nay , my beloved , sweetest friend , ” continued the other , “ compose yourself .
Catherine Morland	I am amazingly agitated , as you perceive .
Catherine Morland	Well , and so you guessed it the moment you had my note ?
Catherine Morland	Sly creature !
Catherine Morland	my dear Catherine , you alone , who know my heart , can judge of my present happiness .
Catherine Morland	Your brother is the most charming of men .
Catherine Morland	But what will your excellent father and mother say ?
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s understanding began to awake : an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind ; and , with the natural blush of so new an emotion , she cried out , “ Good heaven !
Catherine Morland	my dear Isabella , what do you mean ?
Catherine Morland	This bold surmise , however , she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact .
Catherine Morland	The anxious affection , which she was accused of having continually watched in Isabella ’s every look and action , had , in the course of their yesterday ’s party , received the delightful confession of an equal love .
Catherine Morland	Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James .
Catherine Morland	Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest , wonder , and joy .
Catherine Morland	Her brother and her friend engaged !
Catherine Morland	new to such circumstances , the importance of it appeared unspeakably great , and she contemplated it as one of those grand events , of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return .
Catherine Morland	The strength of her feelings she could not express ; the nature of them , however , contented her friend .
Catherine Morland	Delighting , however , as Catherine sincerely did , in the prospect of the connection , it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations .
Catherine Morland	“ You will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland ’s family than to my own .
Catherine Morland	This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine .
Catherine Morland	“ You are so like your dear brother , ” continued Isabella , “ that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you .
Catherine Morland	Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love ; for , though exceedingly fond of her brother , and partial to all his endowments , she had never in her life thought him handsome .
Catherine Morland	“ I remember too , Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening , and wore her puce - coloured sarsenet ; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her ; I could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it .
Catherine Morland	catherine , the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother ’s account !
Catherine Morland	i would not have you suffer half what I have done !
Catherine Morland	i am grown wretchedly thin , I know ; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety ; you have seen enough of it .
Catherine Morland	I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually — so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church !
Catherine Morland	but my secret I was always sure would be safe with _ you _ . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer ; but ashamed of an ignorance little expected , she dared no longer contest the point , nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her .
Catherine Morland	Her brother , she found , was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton , to make known his situation and ask consent ; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella .
Catherine Morland	Catherine endeavoured to persuade her , as she was herself persuaded , that her father and mother would never oppose their son ’s wishes .
Catherine Morland	“ It is impossible , ” said she , “ for parents to be more kind , or more desirous of their children ’s happiness ; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately . ”
Catherine Morland	Your brother , who might marry anybody ! ”
Catherine Morland	Here Catherine again discerned the force of love .
Catherine Morland	my sweet Catherine , in _ your _ generous heart I know it would signify nothing ; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many .
Catherine Morland	Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . ” This charming sentiment , recommended as much by sense as novelty , gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance ; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea .
Catherine Morland	I am sure they will consent , ” was her frequent declaration ; “ I am sure they will be delighted with you . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Richmond ! ” cried Catherine .
Catherine Morland	If I can but be near _ you _ , I shall be satisfied .
Catherine Morland	i will not allow myself to think of such things , till we have your father ’s answer .
Catherine Morland	Catherine wished to congratulate him , but knew not what to say , and her eloquence was only in her eyes .
Catherine Morland	To Catherine ’s simple feelings , this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant , nor consistently supported ; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out , had its inconsistency been less their friend ; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their “ I know what ” ; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit , a display of family ingenuity , on one side in the mystery of an affected secret , on the other of undefined discovery , all equally acute
Catherine Morland	Catherine was with her friend again the next day , endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters ; a needful exertion , for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near , Isabella became more and more desponding , and before the letter arrived , had worked herself into a state of real distress .
Catherine Morland	Mrs. Thorpe , with tears of joy , embraced her daughter , her son , her visitor , and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction .
Catherine Morland	The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland ’s promise ; his honour was pledged to make everything easy ; and by what means their income was to be formed , whether landed property were to be resigned , or funded money made over , was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern .
Catherine Morland	She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment , and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities .
Catherine Morland	She saw herself at the end of a few weeks , the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at Fullerton , the envy of every valued old friend in Putney , with a carriage at her command , a new name on her tickets , and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger . When the contents of the letter were ascertained , John Thorpe , who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to London , prepared to set off .
Catherine Morland	“ Well , Miss Morland , ” said he , on finding her alone in the parlour , “ I am come to bid you good - bye . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine wished him a good journey .
Catherine Morland	Without appearing to hear her , he walked to the window , fidgeted about , hummed a tune , and seemed wholly self - occupied .
Catherine Morland	“ Shall not you be late at Devizes ? ” said Catherine .
Catherine Morland	What do you think of it , Miss Morland ?
Catherine Morland	“ I am sure I think it a very good one . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Do you ?
Catherine Morland	i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however .
Catherine Morland	I say , you will come to Belle ’s wedding , I hope . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes ; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . ” “ And then you know”—twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh—“I say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . ” “ May we ?
Catherine Morland	But I never sing .
Catherine Morland	Well , I wish you a good journey .
Catherine Morland	I dine with Miss Tilney to - day , and must now be going home . ” “ Nay , but there is no such confounded hurry .
Catherine Morland	Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight , and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Then why do you stay away so long ? ” replied Catherine — finding that he waited for an answer .
Catherine Morland	“ That is kind of you , however — kind and good - natured .
Catherine Morland	But you have more good nature and all that , than anybody living , I believe .
Catherine Morland	A monstrous deal of good nature , and it is not only good nature , but you have so much , so much of everything ; and
Catherine Morland	then you have such — upon my soul , I do not know anybody like you . ”
Catherine Morland	dear , there are a great many people like me , I dare say , only a great deal better .
Catherine Morland	Good morning to you .
Catherine Morland	“ But I say , Miss Morland , I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long , if not disagreeable . ” “ Pray do .
Catherine Morland	My father and mother will be very glad to see you . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And I hope — I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . ”
Catherine Morland	There are very few people I am sorry to see .
Catherine Morland	“ Perhaps we may ; but it is more than I ever thought of .
Catherine Morland	And as to _ most matters _ , to say the truth , there are not many that I know my own mind about . ” “ By Jove , no more do I.
Catherine Morland	It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me .
Catherine Morland	My notion of things is simple enough .
Catherine Morland	Let me only have the girl I like , say I , with a comfortable house over my head , and what care I for all the rest ?
Catherine Morland	I am sure of a good income of my own ; and if she had not a penny , why , so much the better .
Catherine Morland	I think like you there .
Catherine Morland	I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another .
Catherine Morland	And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence .
Catherine Morland	We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton , whenever it is convenient . ”
Catherine Morland	And away she went .
Catherine Morland	It was not in the power of all his gallantry to detain her longer .
Catherine Morland	With such news to communicate , and such a visit to prepare for , her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge ; and she hurried away , leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address , and her explicit encouragement .
Catherine Morland	The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother ’s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in Mr. and Mrs. Allen , by the communication of the wonderful event .
Catherine Morland	How great was her disappointment !
Catherine Morland	had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother ’s arrival ; and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people ’s happiness , with a remark , on the gentleman ’s side , in favour of Isabella ’s beauty , and on the lady ’s , of her great good luck .
Catherine Morland	It was to Catherine the most surprising insensibility .
Catherine Morland	The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour ; and , on Anne ’s quitting it to call her sister , Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday ’s party .
Catherine Morland	“ She will never forgive me , I am sure ; but , you know , how could I help it ?
Catherine Morland	“ Nay , my beloved , sweetest friend , ” continued the other , “ compose yourself .
Catherine Morland	I am amazingly agitated , as you perceive .
Catherine Morland	Well , and so you guessed it the moment you had my note ?
Catherine Morland	my dear Catherine , you alone , who know my heart , can judge of my present happiness .
Catherine Morland	I only wish I were more worthy of him .
Catherine Morland	when I think of them I am so agitated ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ You will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland ’s family than to my own .
Catherine Morland	“ You are so like your dear brother , ” continued Isabella , “ that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you .
Catherine Morland	But so it always is with me ; the first moment settles everything .
Catherine Morland	The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas — the very first moment I beheld him — my heart was irrecoverably gone .
Catherine Morland	I remember I wore my yellow gown , with my hair done up in braids ; and when I came into the drawing - room , and John introduced him , I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before .
Catherine Morland	“ I remember too , Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening , and wore her puce - coloured sarsenet ; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her ; I could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it .
Catherine Morland	catherine , the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother ’s account !
Catherine Morland	i would not have you suffer half what I have done !
Catherine Morland	i am grown wretchedly thin , I know ; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety ; you have seen enough of it .
Catherine Morland	but my secret I was always sure would be safe with _ you _ . ”
Catherine Morland	As for myself , I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed .
Catherine Morland	Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . ” This charming sentiment , recommended as much by sense as novelty , gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance ; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea .
Catherine Morland	I am sure they will consent , ” was her frequent declaration ; “ I am sure they will be delighted with you . ”
Catherine Morland	Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone .
Catherine Morland	“ Indeed , Morland , I must drive you away .
Catherine Morland	Consider how far you have to ride .
Catherine Morland	I can not bear to see you linger so .
Catherine Morland	To Catherine ’s simple feelings , this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant , nor consistently supported ; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out , had its inconsistency been less their friend ; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their “ I know what ” ; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit , a display of family ingenuity , on one side in the mystery of an affected secret , on the other of undefined discovery , all equally acute
Catherine Morland	I say , you will come to Belle ’s wedding , I hope . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes ; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . ” “ And then you know”—twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh—“I say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . ” “ May we ?
Catherine Morland	I shall not forget it in a hurry .
Catherine Morland	But you have more good nature and all that , than anybody living , I believe .
Catherine Morland	then you have such — upon my soul , I do not know anybody like you . ”
Catherine Morland	My father and mother will be very glad to see you . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And I hope — I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . ”
Catherine Morland	dear , not at all .
Catherine Morland	“ That is just my way of thinking .
Catherine Morland	Give me but a little cheerful company , let me only have the company of the people I love , let me only be where I like and with whom I like , and the devil take the rest , say I.
Catherine Morland	And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same .
Catherine Morland	But I have a notion , Miss Morland , you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters .
Catherine Morland	And as to _ most matters _ , to say the truth , there are not many that I know my own mind about . ” “ By Jove , no more do I.
Catherine Morland	I think like you there .
Catherine Morland	20 Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend , whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion , and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased .
Catherine Morland	Her happiness in going with Miss Tilney , however , prevented their wishing it otherwise ; and , as they were to remain only one more week in Bath themselves , her quitting them now would not long be felt .
Catherine Morland	Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street , where she was to breakfast , and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends ; but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family , and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right , and of not being able to preserve their good opinion ,
Catherine Morland	that , in the embarrassment of the first five minutes , she could almost have wished to return with him to Pulteney Street .
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney ’s manners and Henry ’s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings ; but still she was far from being at ease ; nor could the incessant attentions of the General himself entirely reassure her .
Catherine Morland	Nay , perverse as it seemed , she doubted whether she might not have felt less , had she been less attended to .
Catherine Morland	His anxiety for her comfort — his continual solicitations that she would eat , and his often - expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste — though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast - table — made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor .
Catherine Morland	She felt utterly unworthy of such respect , and knew not how to reply to it .
Catherine Morland	Her tranquillity was not improved by the General ’s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son , nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down .
Catherine Morland	She was quite pained by the severity of his father ’s reproof , which seemed disproportionate to the offence ; and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture , and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her .
Catherine Morland	This was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation , and she felt great compassion for Captain Tilney , without being able to hope for his goodwill .
Catherine Morland	He listened to his father in silence , and attempted not any defence , which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind , on Isabella ’s account , might , by keeping him long sleepless , have been the real cause of his rising late .
Catherine Morland	It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company , and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him ; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room ; and even afterwards , so much were his spirits affected , she could distinguish nothing but these words , in a whisper to Eleanor , “ How glad I shall be when you are all off .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s spirits revived as they drove from the door ; for with Miss Tilney she felt
Catherine Morland	, with the interest of a road entirely new to her , of an abbey before , and a curricle behind , she caught the last view of Bath without any regret , and met with every milestone before she expected it .
Catherine Morland	The tediousness of a two hours ’ wait at Petty France , in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry , and loiter about without anything to see , next followed — and her admiration of the style in which they travelled , of the fashionable chaise and four — postilions handsomely liveried , rising so regularly in their stirrups , and numerous outriders properly mounted , sunk a little under this consequent inconvenience .
Catherine Morland	the observation of which , with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded , and his angry impatience at the waiters , made Catherine grow every moment more in awe of him , and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four .
Catherine Morland	At last , however , the order of release was given ; and much was Catherine then surprised by the General ’s proposal of her taking his place in his son ’s curricle for the rest of the journey
Catherine Morland	: “ the day was fine , and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible . ”
Catherine Morland	The remembrance of Mr. Allen ’s opinion , respecting young men ’s open carriages , made her blush at the mention of such a plan , and her first thought was to decline it ; but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney ’s judgment ; he could not propose anything improper for her ; and , in the course of a few minutes , she found herself with Henry in the curricle , as happy a being as ever existed . A very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world ; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur , to be sure , but it was a heavy and troublesome business , and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France .
Catherine Morland	; Henry drove so well — so quietly — without making any disturbance , without parading to her , or swearing at them : so different from the only gentleman - coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with !
Catherine Morland	In addition to every other delight , she had now that of listening to her own praise ; of being thanked at least , on his sister ’s account , for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor ; of hearing it ranked as real friendship , and described as creating real gratitude .
Catherine Morland	His sister , he said , was uncomfortably circumstanced — she had no female companion — and , in the frequent absence of her father , was sometimes without any companion at all .
Catherine Morland	“ But how can that be ? ” said Catherine .
Catherine Morland	“ Are not you with her ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ How sorry you must be for that ! ”
Catherine Morland	He smiled , and said , “ You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey . ” “ To be sure , I have .
Catherine Morland	“ And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as ‘ what one reads about ’ may produce ?
Catherine Morland	Have you a stout heart ?
Catherine Morland	yes — I do not think I should be easily frightened , because there would be so many people in the house — and besides , it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years , and then the family come back to it unawares , without giving any notice , as generally happens . ”
Catherine Morland	Can you stand such a ceremony as this ?
Catherine Morland	Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber — too lofty and extensive for you , with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size — its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life , and the bed , of dark green stuff or purple velvet , presenting even a funereal appearance ?
Catherine Morland	Will not your heart sink within you ? ”
Catherine Morland	but this will not happen to me , I am sure .
Catherine Morland	“ How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment !
Catherine Morland	and what will you discern ?
Catherine Morland	Dorothy , meanwhile , no less struck by your appearance , gazes on you in great agitation , and drops a few unintelligible hints .
Catherine Morland	To raise your spirits , moreover , she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted , and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call .
Catherine Morland	but it can not really happen to me .
Catherine Morland	I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy .
Catherine Morland	After surmounting your _ unconquerable _ horror of the bed , you will retire to rest , and get a few hours ’ unquiet slumber .
Catherine Morland	But on the second , or at farthest the _ third _ night after your arrival , you will probably have a violent storm .
Catherine Morland	Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it , you will instantly arise , and throwing your dressing - gown around you , proceed to examine this mystery .
Catherine Morland	“ No , indeed ; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing . ” “ What !
Catherine Morland	not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony , scarcely two miles off .
Catherine Morland	Could you shrink from so simple an adventure ?
Catherine Morland	No , no , you will proceed into this small vaulted room , and through this into several others , without perceiving anything very remarkable in either .
Catherine Morland	In one perhaps there may be a dagger , in another a few drops of blood , and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture ; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way , and your lamp being nearly exhausted , you will return towards your own apartment . In repassing through the small vaulted room , however , your eyes will be attracted towards a large , old - fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold , which , though narrowly examining the furniture before , you had passed unnoticed .
Catherine Morland	Impelled by an irresistible presentiment , you will eagerly advance to it , unlock its folding doors , and search into every drawer — but for some time without discovering anything of importance — perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds .
Catherine Morland	At last , however , by touching a secret spring , an inner compartment will open — a roll of paper appears — you seize it — it contains many sheets of manuscript — you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber , but scarcely have you been able to decipher ‘ Oh thou , whomsoever thou mayst be , into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall’—when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket , and leaves you in total darkness .
Catherine Morland	Well , go on . ” But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther ; he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice , and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of Matilda ’s woes .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , recollecting herself , grew ashamed of her eagerness , and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related .
Catherine Morland	“ Miss Tilney , she was sure , would never put her into such a chamber as he had described !
Catherine Morland	she was not at all afraid .
Catherine Morland	As they drew near the end of their journey , her impatience for a sight of the abbey — for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different — returned in full force , and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone , rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks , with
Catherine Morland	But so low did the building stand , that she found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger , without having discerned even an antique chimney .
Catherine Morland	She knew not that she had any right to be surprised , but there was a something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected .
Catherine Morland	To pass between lodges of a modern appearance , to find herself with such ease in the very precincts of the abbey , and driven so rapidly along a smooth , level road of fine gravel , without obstacle , alarm , or solemnity of any kind , struck her as odd and inconsistent .
Catherine Morland	She was not long at leisure , however , for such considerations .
Catherine Morland	A sudden scud of rain , driving full in her face , made it impossible for her to observe anything further , and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet ; and she was actually under the abbey walls , was springing , with Henry ’s assistance , from the carriage , was beneath the shelter of the old porch , and had even passed on to the hall , where her friend and the General were waiting to welcome her , without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to herself , or one moment ’s suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice .
Catherine Morland	The breeze had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her ; it had wafted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain ; and having given a good shake to her habit
Catherine Morland	, she was ready to be shown into the common drawing - room , and capable of considering where she was . An abbey !
Catherine Morland	but she doubted , as she looked round the room , whether anything within her observation would have given her the consciousness .
Catherine Morland	The fireplace , where she had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times , was contracted to a Rumford , with slabs of plain though handsome marble , and ornaments over it of the prettiest English china .
Catherine Morland	The windows , to which she looked with peculiar dependence , from having heard the General talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with
Catherine Morland	were yet less what her fancy had portrayed .
Catherine Morland	The General , perceiving how her eye was employed , began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture , where everything , being for daily use , pretended only to comfort , etc . ; flattering himself , however , that there were some apartments in the Abbey not unworthy her notice — and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular , when , taking out his watch , he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five !
Catherine Morland	this seemed the word of separation , and Catherine found herself hurried away by Miss Tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctuality to the family hours would be expected at Northanger .
Catherine Morland	On one side it had a range of doors , and it was lighted on the other by windows which Catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle , before Miss Tilney led the way into a chamber , and scarcely staying to hope she would find it comfortable , left her with an anxious entreaty that she would make as little alteration as possible in her dress .
Catherine Morland	The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out , though there were three people to go in it , and his daughter ’s maid had so crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit ; and , so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in , that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing - desk from being thrown out into the street .
Catherine Morland	A moment ’s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of .
Catherine Morland	Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point , she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything , as she greatly dreaded disobliging the General by any delay .
Catherine Morland	Her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste , and she was preparing to unpin the linen package , which the chaise - seat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation , when her eye suddenly fell on a large high chest , standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace .
Catherine Morland	The sight of it made her start ; and , forgetting everything else , she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder , while these thoughts crossed her : “ This is strange indeed !
Catherine Morland	i did not expect such a sight as this !
Catherine Morland	i will look into it — cost me what it may , I will look into it — and directly too — by daylight .
Catherine Morland	If I stay till evening my candle may go out . ”
Catherine Morland	She advanced and examined it closely : it was of cedar , curiously inlaid with some darker wood , and raised , about a foot from the ground , on a carved stand of the same .
Catherine Morland	Catherine bent over it intently , but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty .
Catherine Morland	She could not , in whatever direction she took it , believe the last letter to be a _ T ; _ and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment .
Catherine Morland	Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater ; and seizing , with trembling hands , the hasp of the lock , she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its contents .
Catherine Morland	With difficulty , for something seemed to resist her efforts , she raised the lid a few inches ; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her , starting , quit her hold , and the lid closed with alarming violence .
Catherine Morland	This ill - timed intruder was Miss Tilney ’s maid , sent by her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland ; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her , it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing , and forced her , in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery , to proceed in her dressing without further delay .
Catherine Morland	Her progress was not quick , for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm ; and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt , she could not remain many paces from the chest .
Catherine Morland	At length , however , having slipped one arm into her gown , her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged .
Catherine Morland	One moment surely might be spared ; and , so desperate should be the exertion of her strength , that , unless secured by supernatural means , the lid in one moment should be thrown back .
Catherine Morland	With this spirit she sprang forward , and her confidence did not deceive her .
Catherine Morland	Her resolute effort threw back the lid , and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane , properly folded , reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession !
Catherine Morland	She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney , anxious for her friend ’s being ready , entered the room , and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation , was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search .
Catherine Morland	That is a curious old chest , is not it ? ” said Miss Tilney , as Catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had no leisure for speech , being at once blushing , tying her gown , and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch .
Catherine Morland	Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace .
Catherine Morland	The dining - parlour was a noble room , suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing - room than the one in common use , and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of Catherine , who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants .
Catherine Morland	Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the General , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill - sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating - room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , “ that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , indeed , ” was Catherine ’s honest assurance ; “ Mr. Allen ’s dining - parlour was not more than half as large , ” and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life .
Catherine Morland	It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey ; and even then , even in moments of languor or restraint , a sense of general happiness preponderated , and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , as she crossed the hall , listened to the tempest with sensations of awe ; and , when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door , felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey .
Catherine Morland	Yes , these were characteristic sounds ; they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes , which such buildings had witnessed , and such storms ushered in ; and most heartily did she
Catherine Morland	rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn !
Catherine Morland	_ She _ had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants .
Catherine Morland	Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning .
Catherine Morland	In a house so furnished , and so guarded , she could have nothing to explore or to suffer , and might go to her bedroom as securely as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton .
Catherine Morland	Thus wisely fortifying her mind , as she proceeded upstairs , she was enabled , especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her , to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart ; and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire .
Catherine Morland	“ How much better is this , ” said she , as she walked to the fender—“how much better to find a fire ready lit , than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed , as so many poor girls have been obliged to do , and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot !
Catherine Morland	how glad I am that Northanger is what it is !
Catherine Morland	if it had been like some other places , I do not know that , in such a night as this , I could have answered for my courage : but now , to be sure , there is nothing to alarm one .
Catherine Morland	She looked round the room .
Catherine Morland	It could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the divisions of the shutters ; and she stepped boldly forward , carelessly humming a tune , to assure herself of its being so , peeped courageously behind each curtain , saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her , and on placing a hand against the shutter , felt the strongest conviction of the wind ’s force .
Catherine Morland	A glance at the old chest , as she turned away from this examination , was not without its use ; she scorned the causeless fears of an idle fancy , and began with a most happy indifference to prepare herself for bed .
Catherine Morland	“ She should take her time ; she should not hurry herself ; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house .
Catherine Morland	But she would not make up her fire ; _ that _ would seem cowardly , as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed . ”
Catherine Morland	The fire therefore died away , and Catherine , having spent the best part of an hour in her arrangements , was beginning to think of stepping into bed , when , on giving a parting glance round the room , she was struck by the appearance of a high , old - fashioned black cabinet , which , though in a situation conspicuous enough , had never caught her notice before .
Catherine Morland	Henry ’s words , his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first , immediately rushed across her ; and though there could be nothing really in it , there was something whimsical , it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence ! She took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet .
Catherine Morland	It was not absolutely ebony and gold ; but it was japan , black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind ; and as she held her candle , the yellow had very much the effect of gold .
Catherine Morland	The key was in the door , and she had a strange fancy to look into it ; not , however , with the smallest expectation of finding anything , but it was so very odd , after what Henry had said .
Catherine Morland	In short , she could not sleep till she had examined it .
Catherine Morland	So , placing the candle with great caution on a chair , she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn it ; but it resisted her utmost strength .
Catherine Morland	Alarmed , but not discouraged , she tried it another way ; a bolt flew , and she believed herself successful ; but how strangely mysterious !
Catherine Morland	She paused a moment in breathless wonder .
Catherine Morland	The wind roared down the chimney , the rain beat in torrents against the windows , and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation .
Catherine Morland	To retire to bed , however , unsatisfied on such a point , would be vain , since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity .
Catherine Morland	Again , therefore , she applied herself to the key , and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope ’s last effort , the door suddenly yielded to her hand :
Catherine Morland	her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory , and having thrown open each folding door , the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock , though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual , a double range of small drawers appeared in view , with some larger drawers above and below them ; and in the centre , a small door , closed also with a lock and key , secured in all probability a cavity of importance .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s heart beat quick , but her courage did not fail her .
Catherine Morland	With a cheek flushed by hope , and an eye straining with curiosity , her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth .
Catherine Morland	With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second , a third , a fourth ; each was equally empty .
Catherine Morland	, the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her , and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain .
Catherine Morland	The place in the middle alone remained now unexplored ; and though she had “ never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet , and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far , it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it . ”
Catherine Morland	It was some time however before she could unfasten the door , the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer ; but at length it did open ; and not
Catherine Morland	, as hitherto , was her search ; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity , apparently for concealment , and her feelings at that moment were indescribable .
Catherine Morland	Her heart fluttered , her knees trembled , and her cheeks grew pale .
Catherine Morland	She seized , with an unsteady hand , the precious manuscript , for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters ; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold , resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest .
Catherine Morland	The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm ; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction ; it had yet some hours to burn ; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion , she hastily snuffed it .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , for a few moments , was motionless with horror .
Catherine Morland	Catherine trembled from head to foot .
Catherine Morland	In the pause which succeeded , a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear .
Catherine Morland	A cold sweat stood on her forehead , the manuscript fell from her hand , and groping her way to the bed , she jumped hastily in , and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes .
Catherine Morland	To close her eyes in sleep that night , she felt must be entirely out of the question .
Catherine Morland	The storm too abroad so dreadful ! she had not been used to feel alarm from wind , but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence .
Catherine Morland	And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it !
Catherine Morland	till she had made herself mistress of its contents , however , she could have neither repose nor comfort ; and with the sun ’s first rays she was determined to peruse it .
Catherine Morland	She shuddered , tossed about in her bed , and envied every quiet sleeper .
Catherine Morland	The storm still raged , and various were the noises , more terrific even than the wind , which struck at intervals on her startled ear .
Catherine Morland	The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion , and at another the lock of her door was agitated , as if by the attempt of somebody to enter .
Catherine Morland	Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery , and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans .
Catherine Morland	Hour after hour passed away , and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep .
Catherine Morland	In a private consultation between Isabella and James , the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going , and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her , it was agreed that , provided the weather were fair , the party should take place on the following morning ; and they were to set off very early , in order to be at home in good time .
Catherine Morland	The affair thus determined , and Thorpe ’s approbation secured , Catherine only remained to be apprised of it .
Catherine Morland	She had left them for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney .
Catherine Morland	In that interval the plan was completed , and as soon as she came again , her agreement was demanded ; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella , Catherine looked grave , was very sorry , but could not go .
Catherine Morland	The engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her to accompany them now .
Catherine Morland	She had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk to - morrow ; it was quite determined , and she would not , upon any account , retract .
Catherine Morland	But that she _ must _ and _ should _ retract , was instantly the eager cry of both the Thorpes ; they must go to Clifton to - morrow , they would not go without her , it would be nothing to put off a mere walk for one day longer , and they would not hear of a refusal .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was distressed , but not subdued .
Catherine Morland	“ Do not urge me , Isabella .
Catherine Morland	I am engaged to Miss Tilney .
Catherine Morland	I can not go . ”
Catherine Morland	The same arguments assailed her again ; she must go , she should go , and they would not hear of a refusal .
Catherine Morland	I could not do it .
Catherine Morland	But Isabella became only more and more urgent , calling on her in the most affectionate manner , addressing her by the most endearing names .
Catherine Morland	She was sure her dearest , sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly .
Catherine Morland	She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart , so sweet a temper , to be so easily persuaded by those she loved .
Catherine Morland	But all in vain ; Catherine felt herself to be in the right , and though pained by such tender , such flattering supplication , could not allow it to influence her .
Catherine Morland	She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney , though she had known her so little a while , than for her best and oldest friends , with being grown cold and indifferent , in short , towards herself .
Catherine Morland	“ I can not help being jealous , Catherine , when I see myself slighted for strangers , I , who love you so excessively !
Catherine Morland	But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody ’s ; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace ; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick , I own .
Catherine Morland	Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind .
Catherine Morland	Isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish , regardless of everything but her own gratification .
Catherine Morland	These painful ideas crossed her mind , though she said nothing .
Catherine Morland	Isabella , in the meanwhile , had applied her handkerchief to her eyes ; and Morland , miserable at such a sight , could not help saying , “ Nay , Catherine .
Catherine Morland	I think you can not stand out any longer now .
Catherine Morland	The sacrifice is not much ; and to oblige such a friend — I shall think you quite unkind , if you still refuse . ” This was the first time of her brother ’s openly siding against her , and anxious to avoid his displeasure , she proposed a compromise .
Catherine Morland	If they would only put off their scheme till Tuesday , which they might easily do , as it depended only on themselves , she could go with them , and everybody might then be satisfied .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was sorry , but could do no more ; and a short silence ensued , which was broken by Isabella , who in a voice of cold resentment said , “ Very well , then there is an end of the party .
Catherine Morland	If Catherine does not go , I can not .
Catherine Morland	“ Catherine , you must go , ” said James .
Catherine Morland	No , if you do not go , d — — me if I do
Catherine Morland	“ That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure . ”
Catherine Morland	But her words were lost on Thorpe , who had turned abruptly away
Catherine Morland	The three others still continued together , walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine ; sometimes not a word was said , sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches , and her arm was still linked within Isabella ’s , though their hearts were at war .
Catherine Morland	At one moment she was softened , at another irritated ; always distressed , but always steady . “ I did not think you had been so obstinate , Catherine , ” said James
Catherine Morland	; “ you were not used to be so hard to persuade ; you once were the kindest , best - tempered of my sisters . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I hope I am not less so now , ” she replied , very feelingly ; “ but indeed I can not go .
Catherine Morland	If I am wrong , I am doing what I believe to be right . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s heart swelled ; she drew away her arm , and Isabella made no opposition .
Catherine Morland	“ You have not ! ” cried Catherine .
Catherine Morland	Told her you had sent me to say that , having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us to - morrow , you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday .
Catherine Morland	now , my sweet Catherine ,
Catherine Morland	all our distresses are over ; you are honourably acquitted , and we shall have
Catherine Morland	“ This will not do , ” said Catherine ; “ I can not submit to this .
Catherine Morland	I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I do not care .
Catherine Morland	If I had thought it right to put it off , I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself .
Catherine Morland	This is only doing it in a ruder way ; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has — He may be mistaken again perhaps ; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday .
Catherine Morland	Let me go , Mr. Thorpe ; Isabella , do not hold me . ”
Catherine Morland	Thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys ; they were turning the corner into Brock Street , when he had overtaken them , and were at home by this time .
Catherine Morland	“ Then I will go after them , ” said Catherine ; “ wherever they are I will go after them .
Catherine Morland	If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong , I never will be tricked into it . ”
Catherine Morland	And with these words she broke away and hurried off .
Catherine Morland	Thorpe would have darted after her , but Morland withheld him .
Catherine Morland	“ Let her go , let her go , if she will go .
Catherine Morland	“ She is as obstinate as — ” Thorpe never finished the simile , for it could hardly have been a proper one . Away walked Catherine in great agitation , as fast as the crowd would permit her , fearful of being pursued , yet determined to persevere .
Catherine Morland	As she walked , she reflected on what had passed .
Catherine Morland	It was painful to her to disappoint and displease them , particularly to displease her brother ; but she could not repent her resistance .
Catherine Morland	Setting her own inclination apart , to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney , to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before , and on a false pretence too , must have been wrong .
Catherine Morland	She had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone , she had not consulted merely her own gratification ; _ that _ might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself , by seeing Blaize Castle
Catherine Morland	; no , she had attended to what was due to others , and to her own character in their opinion .
Catherine Morland	Her conviction of being right , however , was not enough to restore her composure ; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not be at ease ; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent
Catherine Morland	, she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of Milsom Street .
Catherine Morland	So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the Tilneys ’ advantage in the outset , they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them ; and the servant still remaining at the open door , she used only the ceremony of saying that she must speak with Miss Tilney that moment , and hurrying by him proceeded upstairs .
Catherine Morland	Then , opening the first door before her , which happened to be the right , she immediately found herself in the drawing - room with General Tilney , his son , and daughter .
Catherine Morland	Her explanation , defective only in being — from her irritation of nerves and shortness of breath — no explanation at all , was instantly given .
Catherine Morland	“ I am come in a great hurry — It was all a mistake — I never promised to go — I told them from the first I could not go.—I ran away in a great hurry to explain it.—I did not care what you thought of me.—I would not stay for the servant . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine found that John Thorpe _ had _ given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it .
Catherine Morland	But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment , Catherine , though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication , had no means of knowing .
Catherine Morland	Whatever might have been felt before her arrival , her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire .
Catherine Morland	The affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father , and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe ’s information to her mind , and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on .
Catherine Morland	To such anxious attention was the General ’s civility carried , that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house , he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself .
Catherine Morland	And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence , it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever , if not his place , by her rapidity . After sitting with them a quarter of an hour , she rose to take leave , and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney ’s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was greatly obliged ; but it was quite out of her power .
Catherine Morland	Mr. and Mrs. Allen would expect her back every moment .
Catherine Morland	The General declared he could say no more ; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded ; but on some other day he trusted , when longer notice could be given , they would not refuse to spare her to her friend .
Catherine Morland	“ Oh , no ; Catherine was sure they would not have the least objection , and she should have great pleasure in coming . ”
Catherine Morland	The General attended her himself to the street - door , saying everything gallant as they went downstairs , admiring the elasticity of her walk , which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing , and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld , when they parted .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , delighted by all that had passed , proceeded gaily to Pulteney Street , walking , as she concluded , with great elasticity , though she had never thought of it before .
Catherine Morland	She reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party ; and now that she had been triumphant throughout , had carried her point , and was secure of her walk , she began ( as the flutter of her spirits subsided ) to doubt whether she had been perfectly right .
Catherine Morland	A sacrifice was always noble ; and if she had given way to their entreaties , she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased , a brother angry , and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed , perhaps through her means .
Catherine Morland	To ease her mind , and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been , she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the half - settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following day .
Catherine Morland	“ Well , ” said he , “ and do you think of going too ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No ; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it ; and therefore you know I could not go with them , could I ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , certainly not ; and I am glad you do not think of it .
Catherine Morland	I am glad you do not think of going ; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased .
Catherine Morland	You are splashed getting in and getting out ; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction .
Catherine Morland	I hate an open carriage myself . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I know you do ; but that is not the question .
Catherine Morland	Do not you think it has an odd appearance , if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men , to whom they are not even related ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , my dear , a very odd appearance indeed .
Catherine Morland	“ Dear madam , ” cried Catherine , “ then why did not you tell me so before ?
Catherine Morland	I am sure if I had known it to be improper , I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all ; but I always hoped you would tell me , if you thought I was doing wrong . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And so I should , my dear , you may depend on it ; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting , I would always do the best for you in my power .
Catherine Morland	Young people _ will _ be young people , as your good mother says herself .
Catherine Morland	You know I wanted you , when we first came , not to buy that sprigged muslin , but you would .
Catherine Morland	“ But this was something of real consequence ; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade .
Catherine Morland	“ As far as it has gone hitherto , there is no harm done , ” said Mr. Allen ; “ and I would only advise you , my dear , not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any more .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , relieved for herself , felt uneasy for Isabella , and after a moment ’s thought , asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe , and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself ; for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day , in spite of what had passed .
Catherine Morland	Mr. Allen , however , discouraged her from doing any such thing .
Catherine Morland	“ You had better leave her alone , my dear ; she is old enough to know what she is about , and if not , has a mother to advise her .
Catherine Morland	Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt ; but , however , you had better not interfere .
Catherine Morland	She and your brother choose to go , and you will be only getting ill will . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine submitted , and though sorry to think that Isabella should be doing wrong , felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen ’s approbation of her own conduct , and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself .
Catherine Morland	Her escape from being one of the party to Clifton
Catherine Morland	was now an escape indeed ; for what would the Tilneys have thought of her , if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself , if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety , only to enable her to be guilty of another
Catherine Morland	The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath ; and whether it should be the last was for some time a question , to which Catherine listened with a beating heart .
Catherine Morland	To have her acquaintance with the Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance .
Catherine Morland	Her whole happiness seemed at stake , while the affair was in suspense , and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should be taken for another fortnight .
Catherine Morland	What this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine ’s speculation .
Catherine Morland	Once or twice indeed , since James ’s engagement had taught her what _ could _ be done , she had got so far as to indulge in a secret “ perhaps , ” but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views : the present was now comprised in another three weeks , and her happiness being certain for that period , the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest .
Catherine Morland	In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged , she visited Miss Tilney , and poured
Catherine Morland	forth her joyful feelings
Catherine Morland	No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen ’s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father ’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week . Here was a blow !
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s countenance fell , and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney ’s concluding words , “ By the end of another week ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am very sorry for it , ” said Catherine dejectedly ; “ if I had known this before — ” “ Perhaps , ” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding .
Catherine Morland	After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , “ Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ” “ I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ” “ Well , proceed by all means .
Catherine Morland	I know how much your heart is in it .
Catherine Morland	My daughter , Miss Morland , ” he continued , without leaving his daughter time to speak , “ has been forming a very bold wish .
Catherine Morland	We leave Bath , as she has perhaps told you , on Saturday se’nnight .
Catherine Morland	And could we carry our selfish point with you , we should leave it without a single regret .
Catherine Morland	Can you , in short , be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire ?
Catherine Morland	I am almost ashamed to make the request , though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself .
Catherine Morland	If you can
Catherine Morland	be induced to honour us with a visit , you will make us happy beyond expression .
Catherine Morland	’ Tis true , we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place ; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour , for our mode of living , as you see , is plain and unpretending ; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable .
Catherine Morland	these were thrilling words , and wound up Catherine ’s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy .
Catherine Morland	Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness .
Catherine Morland	To receive so flattering an invitation ! to have her company so warmly solicited !
Catherine Morland	everything honourable and soothing , every present enjoyment , and every future hope was contained in it ; and her acceptance , with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma ’s approbation , was eagerly given .
Catherine Morland	“ I will write home directly , ” said she , “ and if they do not object , as I dare say they will not — ” General Tilney was not less sanguine , having already waited on her excellent friends in Pulteney Street , and obtained their sanction of his wishes .
Catherine Morland	“ Since they can consent to part with you , ” said he , “ we may expect philosophy from all the world . ”
Catherine Morland	The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine ’s feelings through the varieties of suspense , security , and disappointment ; but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss ; and with spirits elated to rapture ,
Catherine Morland	with Henry at her heart , and Northanger Abbey on her lips , she hurried home to write her letter .
Catherine Morland	their daughter
Catherine Morland	, felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye , and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire .
Catherine Morland	This indulgence , though not more than Catherine had hoped for , completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature , in friends and fortune , circumstance and chance .
Catherine Morland	Everything seemed to cooperate for her advantage .
Catherine Morland	By the kindness of her first friends , the Allens , she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her .
Catherine Morland	Her feelings , her preferences , had each known the happiness of a return .
Catherine Morland	Wherever she felt attachment , she had been able to create it .
Catherine Morland	The affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister .
Catherine Morland	The Tilneys , they , by whom , above all , she desired to be favourably thought of , outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued .
Catherine Morland	She was to be their chosen visitor , she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized — and , in addition to all the rest , this roof was to be the roof of an abbey !
Catherine Morland	her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney — and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill
Catherine Morland	With all the chances against her of house , hall , place , park , court , and cottage , Northanger turned up an abbey , and she was to be its inhabitant .
Catherine Morland	Its long , damp passages , its narrow cells and ruined chapel , were to be within her daily reach ,
Catherine Morland	she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends , some awful memorials of an injured and ill - fated nun . It was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home , that the consciousness of it should be so meekly borne .
Catherine Morland	Many were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney ; but so active were her thoughts , that when these inquiries were answered , she was hardly more assured than before , of Northanger Abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation , of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution , of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed , or of its standing low in a valley , sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak .
Catherine Morland	They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms ; and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine .
Catherine Morland	His address was good , and Catherine felt herself in high luck .
Catherine Morland	There was little leisure for speaking while they danced ; but when they were seated at tea , she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being .
Catherine Morland	He talked with fluency and spirit — and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested , though it was hardly understood by her .
Catherine Morland	After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them , he suddenly addressed her with—“I have hitherto been very remiss , madam , in the proper attentions of a partner here ; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath ; whether you were ever here before ; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms , the theatre , and the concert ; and how you like the place altogether .
Catherine Morland	I have been very negligent — but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars ?
Catherine Morland	If you are I will begin directly . ” “ You need not give yourself that trouble , sir . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No trouble , I assure you , madam . ”
Catherine Morland	Then forming his features into a set smile , and affectedly softening his voice , he added , with a simpering air , “ Have you been long in Bath , madam ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ About a week , sir , ” replied Catherine , trying not to laugh .
Catherine Morland	“ Why should you be surprised , sir ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply , and surprise is more easily assumed , and not less reasonable than any other .
Catherine Morland	Were you never here before , madam ? ”
Catherine Morland	have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , sir , I was there last Monday . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Have you been to the theatre ? ” “ Yes , sir , I was at the play on Tuesday . ” “ To the concert ? ” “ Yes , sir , on Wednesday . ” “ And are you altogether pleased with Bath ? ” “ Yes — I like it very well . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine turned away her head , not knowing whether she might venture to laugh . “ I see what you think of me , ” said he gravely—“I shall make but a poor figure in your journal to - morrow . ”
Catherine Morland	“ My journal ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , I know exactly what you will say : Friday , went to the Lower Rooms ; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings — plain black shoes — appeared to much advantage ; but was strangely harassed by a queer , half - witted man , who would make me dance with him , and distressed me by his nonsense . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Indeed I shall say no such thing . ” “ Shall I tell you what you ought to say ? ” “ If you please . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I danced with a very agreeable young man , introduced by Mr. King ; had a great deal of conversation with him — seems a most extraordinary genius — hope I may know more of him .
Catherine Morland	_ That _ , madam , is what I _ wish _ you to say . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But , perhaps , I keep no journal . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Perhaps you are not sitting in this room , and I am not sitting by you .
Catherine Morland	how are your absent cousins to understand the tenor of your life in Bath without one ?
Catherine Morland	How are your various dresses to be remembered , and the particular state of your complexion , and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities , without having constant recourse to a journal ?
Catherine Morland	My dear madam , I am not so ignorant of young ladies ’ ways as you wish to believe me ; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated .
Catherine Morland	“ I have sometimes thought , ” said Catherine , doubtingly , “ whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen !
Catherine Morland	that is — I should not think the superiority was always on our side . ”
Catherine Morland	“ As far as I have had opportunity of judging , it appears to me that the usual style of letter - writing among women is faultless , except in three particulars . ” “ And what are they ?
Catherine Morland	“ Upon my word !
Catherine Morland	i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment .
Catherine Morland	You do not think too highly of us in that way . ” “ I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men , than that they sing better duets , or draw better landscapes .
Catherine Morland	“ My dear Catherine , ” said she , “ do take this pin out of my sleeve ; I am afraid it has torn a hole already ; I shall be quite sorry if it has , for this is a favourite gown , though it cost but nine shillings a yard .
Catherine Morland	“ And pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland ’s gown ? ” “ It is very pretty , madam , ” said he , gravely examining it ; “ but I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . ”
Catherine Morland	“ How can you , ” said Catherine , laughing , “ be so — ”
Catherine Morland	She had almost said “ strange . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am quite of your opinion , sir , ” replied Mrs. Allen ; “ and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak .
Catherine Morland	Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said ; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced .
Catherine Morland	Catherine feared , as she listened to their discourse , that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others .
Catherine Morland	“ What are you thinking of so earnestly ? ” said he , as they walked back to the ballroom ; “ not of your partner , I hope , for , by that shake of the head , your meditations are not satisfactory . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine coloured , and said , “ I was not thinking of anything . ”
Catherine Morland	“ That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well then , I will not . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Thank you ; for now we shall soon be acquainted , as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet , and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much .
Catherine Morland	Whether she thought of him so much , while she drank her warm wine and water , and prepared herself for bed , as to dream of him when there , can not be ascertained ; but I hope it was no more than in a
Catherine Morland	From this time , the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people ; and Catherine found , with some surprise , that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella ’s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother .
Catherine Morland	Their persuasion that the General would , upon this ground alone , independent of the objection that might be raised against her character , oppose the connection , turned her
Catherine Morland	feelings moreover with some alarm towards herself .
Catherine Morland	She was as insignificant , and perhaps as portionless , as Isabella ; and if the heir of the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself , at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest ?
Catherine Morland	The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality , which , as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions , she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the General ; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money ,
Catherine Morland	which she had more than once heard him utter , and which tempted her to think
Catherine Morland	They were so fully convinced , however , that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person for his father ’s consent , and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to come to Northanger than at the present time , that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own .
Catherine Morland	But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella ’s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations .
Catherine Morland	She proposed it to him accordingly ; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected .
Catherine Morland	Henry was greatly honoured and very happy , and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme .
Catherine Morland	“ And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ?
Catherine Morland	I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting , and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days . ”
Catherine Morland	You are not to put yourself at all out of your way .
Catherine Morland	Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough .
Catherine Morland	Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come
Catherine Morland	But on Wednesday , I think , Henry , you may expect us ; and we shall be with you early , that we may have time to look about us .
Catherine Morland	Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston , I suppose ; we shall be in the carriage by ten ; so , about a quarter before one on Wednesday , you may look for us . ”
Catherine Morland	A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion , so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston ; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry , about an hour afterwards , came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting , and said , “ I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour .
Catherine Morland	Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday , which bad weather , or twenty other causes , may prevent , I must go away directly , two days before I intended it .
Catherine Morland	“ Go away ! ” said Catherine , with a very long face .
Catherine Morland	how can you ask the question ?
Catherine Morland	Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits , because I must go and prepare a dinner for you , to be sure . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Aye , and sadly too — for I had much rather stay . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But how can you think of such a thing , after what the General said ?
Catherine Morland	When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble , because _ anything _ would do . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your
Catherine Morland	You must know it to be so ; and the General made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . ” “ I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own .
Catherine Morland	He went ; and , it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry ’s , she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right , however disagreeable to her his going .
Catherine Morland	But the inexplicability of the General ’s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts .
Catherine Morland	That he was very particular in his eating , she had , by her own unassisted observation , already discovered ; but why he should say one thing so positively , and mean another all the while , was most unaccountable !
Catherine Morland	This was the sad finale of every reflection : and Captain Tilney ’s letter would certainly come in his absence ; and Wednesday she was very sure would be wet .
Catherine Morland	Her brother so unhappy , and her loss in Isabella so great ; and
Catherine Morland	what was there to interest or amuse her ?
Catherine Morland	She was tired of the woods and the shrubberies — always so smooth and so dry ; and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house .
Catherine Morland	What a revolution in her ideas !
Catherine Morland	she , who had so longed to be in an abbey !
Catherine Morland	now , there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well - connected parsonage , something like Fullerton , but better :
Catherine Morland	It came — it was fine — and Catherine trod on air .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler ’s shops which they passed .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s mind was too full , as she entered the house , for her either to observe or to say a great deal ; and , till called on by the General for her opinion of it , she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting .
Catherine Morland	Upon looking round it then , she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world ; but she was too guarded to say so , and the coldness of her praise disappointed him .
Catherine Morland	Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits .
Catherine Morland	The room in question was of a commodious , well - proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining - parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing - room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the General .
Catherine Morland	It was a prettily shaped room , the windows reaching to the ground , and the view from them pleasant , though only over green meadows ; and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it .
Catherine Morland	it is the prettiest room I ever saw ; it is the prettiest room in the world ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well , if it was my house , I should never sit anywhere else .
Catherine Morland	“ You like it — you approve it as an object — it is enough .
Catherine Morland	” Such a compliment recalled all Catherine ’s consciousness , and silenced her directly ; and , though pointedly applied to by the General for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings , nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her .
Catherine Morland	, however , was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations ; and , having reached the ornamental part of the premises , consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow , on which Henry ’s genius had begun to act about half a year ago , she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure - ground she had ever been in before , though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner .
Catherine Morland	A saunter into other meadows , and through part of the village , with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements , and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about , brought them to four o’clock , when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three .
Catherine Morland	She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the General ; nay , that he was even looking at the side - table for cold meat which was not there .
Catherine Morland	They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own , and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter ’s being oiled . At six o’clock , the General having taken his coffee , the carriage again received them ; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit , so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations , that , could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son , Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it .
Catherine Morland	The General , meanwhile , though offended every morning by Frederick ’s remissness in writing , was free from any real anxiety about him , and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland ’s time at Northanger pass pleasantly .
Catherine Morland	He often expressed his uneasiness on this head , feared the sameness of every day ’s society and employments would disgust her with the place , wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country , talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner , and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood .
Catherine Morland	I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it .
Catherine Morland	30 Catherine ’s disposition was not naturally sedentary , nor had her habits been ever very industrious ; but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort , her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased .
Catherine Morland	She could neither sit still nor employ herself for ten minutes together , walking round the garden and orchard again and again , as if nothing but motion was voluntary ; and it seemed as if she could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time in the parlour .
Catherine Morland	Her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration .
Catherine Morland	In her rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself ; but in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she had been before .
Catherine Morland	For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint ; but when a third night ’s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness , improved her in useful activity , nor given her a greater inclination for needlework , she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of , “ My dear Catherine , I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady .
Catherine Morland	I do not know when poor Richard ’s cravats would be done , if he had no friend but you .
Catherine Morland	Your head runs too much upon Bath ; but there is a time for everything — a time for balls and plays , and a time for work .
Catherine Morland	You have had a long run of amusement , and now you must try to be useful . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine took up her work directly , saying , in a dejected voice , that “ her head did not run upon Bath — much . ” “ Then you are fretting about General Tilney , and that is very simple of you ; for ten to one whether you ever see him again .
Catherine Morland	You should never fret about trifles . ”
Catherine Morland	After a short silence—“I hope , my Catherine , you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as Northanger .
Catherine Morland	That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed .
Catherine Morland	Wherever you are you should always be contented , but especially at home , because there you must spend the most of your time .
Catherine Morland	I did not quite like , at breakfast , to hear you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger .
Catherine Morland	” “ I am sure I do not care about the bread .
Catherine Morland	It is all the same to me what I eat .
Catherine Morland	I will look it out for you some day or other , because I am sure it will do you good . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine said no more , and , with an endeavour to do right , applied to her work ; but , after a few minutes , sunk again , without knowing it herself , into languor and listlessness , moving herself in her chair , from the irritation of weariness , much oftener than she moved her needle .
Catherine Morland	Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse ; and seeing , in her daughter ’s absent and dissatisfied look , the full proof of that repining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of cheerfulness , hastily left the room to fetch the book in question , anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady .
Catherine Morland	Returning in silence to his seat , therefore , he remained for some minutes most civilly answering all Mrs. Morland ’s common remarks about the weather and roads . Catherine meanwhile — the anxious , agitated , happy , feverish Catherine — said not a word ; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good - natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time , and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of The Mirror for a future hour .
Catherine Morland	After a couple of minutes ’ unbroken silence , Henry , turning to Catherine for the first time since her mother ’s entrance , asked her , with sudden alacrity , if Mr. and Mrs. Allen were now at Fullerton ?
Catherine Morland	And on developing , from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply , the meaning , which one short syllable would have given , immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them , and , with a rising colour , asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way .
Catherine Morland	“ You may see the house from this window , sir , ” was information on Sarah ’s side , which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman , and a silencing nod from her mother ; for Mrs. Morland , thinking it probable , as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours , that he might have some explanation to give of his father ’s behaviour , which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine , would not on any account prevent her accompanying him .
Catherine Morland	Mr. Allen ’s grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often .
Catherine Morland	She was assured of his affection ; and that heart in return was solicited , which , perhaps , they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own ;
Catherine Morland	for , though Henry was now sincerely attached to her , though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society
Catherine Morland	, I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude , or , in other words , that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought .
Catherine Morland	A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application .
Catherine Morland	Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand .
Catherine Morland	The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight .
Catherine Morland	The General had had nothing to accuse her of , nothing to lay to her charge , but her being the involuntary , unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon , and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own .
Catherine Morland	She was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be .
Catherine Morland	Under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims , he had courted her acquaintance in Bath , solicited her company at Northanger , and designed her for his daughter - in - law .
Catherine Morland	On discovering his error , to turn her from the house seemed the best , though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself , and his contempt of her family .
Catherine Morland	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
Catherine Morland	For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate .
Catherine Morland	Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter ; and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed .
Catherine Morland	Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this , than his own children .
Catherine Morland	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
Catherine Morland	I leave it to my reader ’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine , how much of it he could have learnt from his father , in what points his own conjectures might assist him , and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , at any rate , heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife , she had scarcely sinned against his character , or magnified his cruelty .
Catherine Morland	Henry ’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated , on comprehending his father ’s views , and being ordered to acquiesce in them , had been open and bold .
Catherine Morland	He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand .
Catherine Morland	A moment ’s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of .
Catherine Morland	Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point , she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything , as she greatly dreaded disobliging the General by any delay .
Catherine Morland	Her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste , and she was preparing to unpin the linen package , which the chaise - seat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation , when her eye suddenly fell on a large high chest , standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace .
Catherine Morland	The sight of it made her start ; and , forgetting everything else , she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder , while these thoughts crossed her : “ This is strange indeed !
Catherine Morland	i did not expect such a sight as this !
Catherine Morland	i will look into it — cost me what it may , I will look into it — and directly too — by daylight .
Catherine Morland	If I stay till evening my candle may go out . ”
Catherine Morland	She advanced and examined it closely : it was of cedar , curiously inlaid with some darker wood , and raised , about a foot from the ground , on a carved stand of the same .
Catherine Morland	Catherine bent over it intently , but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty .
Catherine Morland	She could not , in whatever direction she took it , believe the last letter to be a _ T ; _ and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment .
Catherine Morland	Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater ; and seizing , with trembling hands , the hasp of the lock , she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its contents .
Catherine Morland	With difficulty , for something seemed to resist her efforts , she raised the lid a few inches ; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her , starting , quit her hold , and the lid closed with alarming violence .
Catherine Morland	This ill - timed intruder was Miss Tilney ’s maid , sent by her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland ; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her , it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing , and forced her , in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery , to proceed in her dressing without further delay .
Catherine Morland	Her progress was not quick , for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm ; and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt , she could not remain many paces from the chest .
Catherine Morland	At length , however , having slipped one arm into her gown , her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged .
Catherine Morland	One moment surely might be spared ; and , so desperate should be the exertion of her strength , that , unless secured by supernatural means , the lid in one moment should be thrown back .
Catherine Morland	With this spirit she sprang forward , and her confidence did not deceive her .
Catherine Morland	Her resolute effort threw back the lid , and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane , properly folded , reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession !
Catherine Morland	She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney , anxious for her friend ’s being ready , entered the room , and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation , was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search .
Catherine Morland	That is a curious old chest , is not it ? ” said Miss Tilney , as Catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass .
Catherine Morland	How it came to be first put in this room I know not , but I have not had it moved , because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had no leisure for speech , being at once blushing , tying her gown , and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch .
Catherine Morland	Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace .
Catherine Morland	The dining - parlour was a noble room , suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing - room than the one in common use , and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of Catherine , who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants .
Catherine Morland	Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the General , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill - sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating - room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , “ that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , indeed , ” was Catherine ’s honest assurance ; “ Mr. Allen ’s dining - parlour was not more than half as large , ” and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life .
Catherine Morland	It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey ; and even then , even in moments of languor or restraint , a sense of general happiness preponderated , and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , as she crossed the hall , listened to the tempest with sensations of awe ; and , when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door , felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey .
Catherine Morland	Yes , these were characteristic sounds ; they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes , which such buildings had witnessed , and such storms ushered in ; and most heartily did she
Catherine Morland	rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn !
Catherine Morland	_ She _ had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants .
Catherine Morland	Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning .
Catherine Morland	In a house so furnished , and so guarded , she could have nothing to explore or to suffer , and might go to her bedroom as securely as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton .
Catherine Morland	Thus wisely fortifying her mind , as she proceeded upstairs , she was enabled , especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her , to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart ; and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire .
Catherine Morland	“ How much better is this , ” said she , as she walked to the fender—“how much better to find a fire ready lit , than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed , as so many poor girls have been obliged to do , and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot !
Catherine Morland	how glad I am that Northanger is what it is !
Catherine Morland	if it had been like some other places , I do not know that , in such a night as this , I could have answered for my courage : but now , to be sure , there is nothing to alarm one .
Catherine Morland	She looked round the room .
Catherine Morland	It could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the divisions of the shutters ; and she stepped boldly forward , carelessly humming a tune , to assure herself of its being so , peeped courageously behind each curtain , saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her , and on placing a hand against the shutter , felt the strongest conviction of the wind ’s force .
Catherine Morland	A glance at the old chest , as she turned away from this examination , was not without its use ; she scorned the causeless fears of an idle fancy , and began with a most happy indifference to prepare herself for bed .
Catherine Morland	“ She should take her time ; she should not hurry herself ; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house .
Catherine Morland	But she would not make up her fire ; _ that _ would seem cowardly , as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed . ”
Catherine Morland	The fire therefore died away , and Catherine , having spent the best part of an hour in her arrangements , was beginning to think of stepping into bed , when , on giving a parting glance round the room , she was struck by the appearance of a high , old - fashioned black cabinet , which , though in a situation conspicuous enough , had never caught her notice before .
Catherine Morland	Henry ’s words , his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first , immediately rushed across her ; and though there could be nothing really in it , there was something whimsical , it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence ! She took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet .
Catherine Morland	It was not absolutely ebony and gold ; but it was japan , black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind ; and as she held her candle , the yellow had very much the effect of gold .
Catherine Morland	The key was in the door , and she had a strange fancy to look into it ; not , however , with the smallest expectation of finding anything , but it was so very odd , after what Henry had said .
Catherine Morland	In short , she could not sleep till she had examined it .
Catherine Morland	So , placing the candle with great caution on a chair , she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn it ; but it resisted her utmost strength .
Catherine Morland	Alarmed , but not discouraged , she tried it another way ; a bolt flew , and she believed herself successful ; but how strangely mysterious !
Catherine Morland	She paused a moment in breathless wonder .
Catherine Morland	The wind roared down the chimney , the rain beat in torrents against the windows , and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation .
Catherine Morland	To retire to bed , however , unsatisfied on such a point , would be vain , since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity .
Catherine Morland	Again , therefore , she applied herself to the key , and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope ’s last effort , the door suddenly yielded to her hand :
Catherine Morland	her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory , and having thrown open each folding door , the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock , though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual , a double range of small drawers appeared in view , with some larger drawers above and below them ; and in the centre , a small door , closed also with a lock and key , secured in all probability a cavity of importance .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s heart beat quick , but her courage did not fail her .
Catherine Morland	With a cheek flushed by hope , and an eye straining with curiosity , her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth .
Catherine Morland	With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second , a third , a fourth ; each was equally empty .
Catherine Morland	, the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her , and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain .
Catherine Morland	The place in the middle alone remained now unexplored ; and though she had “ never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet , and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far , it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it . ”
Catherine Morland	It was some time however before she could unfasten the door , the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer ; but at length it did open ; and not
Catherine Morland	, as hitherto , was her search ; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity , apparently for concealment , and her feelings at that moment were indescribable .
Catherine Morland	Her heart fluttered , her knees trembled , and her cheeks grew pale .
Catherine Morland	She seized , with an unsteady hand , the precious manuscript , for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters ; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold , resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest .
Catherine Morland	The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm ; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction ; it had yet some hours to burn ; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion , she hastily snuffed it .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , for a few moments , was motionless with horror .
Catherine Morland	Catherine trembled from head to foot .
Catherine Morland	In the pause which succeeded , a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear .
Catherine Morland	A cold sweat stood on her forehead , the manuscript fell from her hand , and groping her way to the bed , she jumped hastily in , and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes .
Catherine Morland	To close her eyes in sleep that night , she felt must be entirely out of the question .
Catherine Morland	The storm too abroad so dreadful ! she had not been used to feel alarm from wind , but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence .
Catherine Morland	And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it !
Catherine Morland	till she had made herself mistress of its contents , however , she could have neither repose nor comfort ; and with the sun ’s first rays she was determined to peruse it .
Catherine Morland	She shuddered , tossed about in her bed , and envied every quiet sleeper .
Catherine Morland	The storm still raged , and various were the noises , more terrific even than the wind , which struck at intervals on her startled ear .
Catherine Morland	The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion , and at another the lock of her door was agitated , as if by the attempt of somebody to enter .
Catherine Morland	Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery , and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans .
Catherine Morland	Hour after hour passed away , and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep .
Catherine Morland	An hour passed away before the General came in , spent , on the part of his young guest , in no very favourable consideration of his character .
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney , understanding in part her friend ’s curiosity to see the house , soon revived the subject ; and her father
Catherine Morland	being , contrary to Catherine ’s expectations , unprovided with any pretence for further delay , beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return , was at last ready to escort them . They set forward ; and , with a grandeur of air , a dignified step , which caught the eye , but could not shake the doubts of the well - read Catherine , he led the way across the hall , through the common drawing - room and one useless antechamber , into a room magnificent both in size and furniture — the real drawing - room , used only with company of consequence .
Catherine Morland	It was very noble — very grand — very charming!—was all that Catherine had to say , for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin ; and all minuteness of praise , all praise that had much meaning , was supplied by the General
Catherine Morland	: the costliness or elegance of any room ’s fitting - up could be nothing to her ; she cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century .
Catherine Morland	Catherine heard , admired , and wondered with more genuine feeling than before — gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge , by running over the titles of half a shelf , and was ready to proceed . But suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes .
Catherine Morland	Large as was the building , she had already visited the greatest part ; though , on being told that , with the addition of the kitchen , the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court , she could scarcely believe it , or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted .
Catherine Morland	It was some relief , however , that they were to return to the rooms in common use , by passing through a few of less importance , looking into the court , which , with occasional passages , not wholly unintricate , connected the different sides ; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister , having traces of cells pointed out , and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her — by finding herself successively in a billiard - room , and in the General ’s private apartment , without comprehending their connection , or being able to turn aright when she left them ; and lastly , by passing through a dark little room , owning Henry ’s authority , and strewed with his litter of books , guns , and greatcoats .
Catherine Morland	From the dining - room , of which , though already seen , and always to be seen at five o’clock , the General could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length , for the more certain information of Miss Morland , as to what she neither doubted nor cared for , they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen — the ancient kitchen of the convent , rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days , and in the stoves and hot closets of the present .
Catherine Morland	Catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest , for the purposes of mere domestic economy ; and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen ,
Catherine Morland	but if he had a vanity , it was in the arrangement of his offices ; and as he was convinced that , to a mind like Miss Morland ’s , a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened , must always be gratifying , he should make no apology for leading her on .
Catherine Morland	They took a slight survey of all ; and Catherine was impressed , beyond her expectation , by their multiplicity and their convenience .
Catherine Morland	The number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices .
Catherine Morland	how inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about — from abbeys and castles , in which , though certainly larger than Northanger , all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost .
Catherine Morland	How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself .
Catherine Morland	They returned to the hall , that the chief staircase might be ascended , and the beauty of its wood , and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out : having gained the top , they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which her room lay , and shortly entered one on the same plan , but superior in length and breadth .
Catherine Morland	She was here shown successively into three large bed - chambers , with their dressing - rooms , most completely and handsomely fitted up ; everything that money and taste could do , to give comfort and elegance to apartments , had been bestowed on these ; and , being furnished within the last five years , they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing , and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine .
Catherine Morland	they were surveying the last , the General , after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured , turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine , and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be “ our friends from Fullerton . ”
Catherine Morland	She felt the unexpected compliment , and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself , and so full of civility to all her family .
Catherine Morland	The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ?
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney drew back directly , and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine , who , having seen , in a momentary glance beyond them , a narrower passage , more numerous openings , and symptoms of a winding staircase , believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice ; and felt , as she unwillingly paced back the gallery , that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest .
Catherine Morland	Something was certainly to be concealed ; her fancy , though it had trespassed lately once or twice , could not mislead her here ; and
Catherine Morland	what that something was , a short sentence of Miss Tilney ’s , as they followed the General at some distance downstairs , seemed to point out : “ I was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ” were all her words ; but few as they were , they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine .
Catherine Morland	She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour .
Catherine Morland	Catherine understood her : the General must be watched from home , before that room could be entered .
Catherine Morland	“ It remains as it was , I suppose ? ” said she , in a tone of feeling .
Catherine Morland	“ And how long ago may it be that your mother died ? ” “ She has been dead these nine years . ”
Catherine Morland	And nine years , Catherine knew , was a trifle of time , compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife , before her room was put to rights .
Catherine Morland	“ You were with her , I suppose , to the last ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , ” said Miss Tilney , sighing ; “ I was unfortunately from home .
Catherine Morland	Her illness was sudden and short ; and , before I arrived it was all over . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words .
Catherine Morland	and , when she saw him in the evening , while she worked with her friend , slowly pacing the drawing - room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness , with downcast eyes and contracted brow , she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him .
Catherine Morland	and the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly , as to catch Miss Tilney ’s notice .
Catherine Morland	“ My father , ” she whispered , “ often walks about the room in this way ; it is nothing unusual . ”
Catherine Morland	“ So much the worse ! ” thought Catherine ; such ill - timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks , and boded nothing good .
Catherine Morland	After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry ’s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell .
Catherine Morland	“ I have many pamphlets to finish , ” said he to Catherine , “ before I can close my eyes , and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep .
Catherine Morland	” But neither the business alleged , nor the magnificent compliment , could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose .
Catherine Morland	In revolving these matters , while she undressed , it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman ’s confinement — might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days ; for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division ?
Catherine Morland	In the high - arched passage , paved with stone , which already she had trodden with peculiar awe , she well remembered the doors of which the General had given no account .
Catherine Morland	In support of the plausibility of this conjecture , it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery , in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney , must be , as certainly as her memory could guide her , exactly over this suspected range of cells , and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse , communicating by some secret means with those cells ,
Catherine Morland	might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband .
Catherine Morland	Down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well - prepared insensibility !
Catherine Morland	Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises , and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far ; but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible .
Catherine Morland	The side of the quadrangle , in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting , being , according to her belief , just opposite her own , it struck her that , if judiciously watched , some rays of light from the General ’s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows , as he passed to the prison of his wife ; and , twice before she stepped into bed , she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery , to see if it appeared ; but all abroad was dark , and it must yet be too early . The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up .
Catherine Morland	Till midnight , she supposed it would be in vain to watch ; but then , when the clock had struck twelve , and all was quiet , she would , if not quite appalled by darkness , steal out and look once more .
Catherine Morland	The clock struck twelve — and Catherine had been half an hour asleep .
Catherine Morland	Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland ’s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather .
Catherine Morland	But when did she judge amiss ?
Catherine Morland	He left the room , and Catherine , with a disappointed , anxious face , began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination , under a mistaken idea of pleasing her ; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney ’s saying , with a little confusion , “ I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father ’s account ; he always walks out at this time of day .
Catherine Morland	Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood .
Catherine Morland	Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed ?
Catherine Morland	Could there be any unwillingness on the General ’s side to show her over the abbey ?
Catherine Morland	Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so .
Catherine Morland	She was all impatience to see the house , and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds .
Catherine Morland	But now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it .
Catherine Morland	Such were her thoughts , but she kept them to herself , and put on her bonnet in patient discontent .
Catherine Morland	She was struck , however , beyond her expectation , by the grandeur of the abbey , as she saw it for the first time from the lawn .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it ; and her feelings of delight were so strong , that without waiting for any better authority , she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise .
Catherine Morland	The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay , being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen ’s , as well as her father ’s , including church - yard and orchard .
Catherine Morland	The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , “ without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom .
Catherine Morland	Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired .
Catherine Morland	“ But where are you going , Eleanor ?
Catherine Morland	Why do you choose that cold , damp path to it ?
Catherine Morland	Miss Morland will get wet .
Catherine Morland	“ This is so favourite a walk of mine , ” said Miss Tilney , “ that I always think it the best and nearest way .
Catherine Morland	It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the General ’s disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward .
Catherine Morland	He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition .
Catherine Morland	He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . “ I am particularly fond of this spot , ” said her companion , with a sigh .
Catherine Morland	“ It was my mother ’s favourite walk . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before , and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance , and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more .
Catherine Morland	“ I used to walk here so often with her ! ” added Eleanor ; “ though I never loved it then , as I have loved it since .
Catherine Morland	At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice .
Catherine Morland	“ And ought it not , ” reflected Catherine , “ to endear it to her husband ?
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney continuing silent , she ventured to say , “ Her death must have been a great affliction ! ”
Catherine Morland	, ” replied the other , in a low voice .
Catherine Morland	“ I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . ”
Catherine Morland	She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ”
Catherine Morland	“ To be sure you must miss him very much . ”
Catherine Morland	Was it from dejection of spirits?”—were questions now eagerly poured forth ; the first three received a ready affirmative , the two others were passed by ; and Catherine ’s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question , whether answered or not .
Catherine Morland	Of her unhappiness in marriage , she felt persuaded .
Catherine Morland	And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . “ Her picture , I suppose , ” blushing at the consummate art of her own question , “ hangs in your father ’s room ? ” “ No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place .
Catherine Morland	Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ” Here was another proof .
Catherine Morland	Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which , in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited ; and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion .
Catherine Morland	his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her .
Catherine Morland	She had often read of such characters , characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn ; but here was proof positive of the contrary .
Catherine Morland	She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the General ; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation , she found herself again obliged to walk with him , listen to him , and even to smile when he smiled .
Catherine Morland	, she soon
Catherine Morland	began to walk with lassitude ; the General perceived it , and with a concern for her health , which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him , was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house .
Catherine Morland	Again they parted — but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return .
Catherine Morland	This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable .
Catherine Morland	The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ?
Catherine Morland	31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start .
Catherine Morland	“ Catherine would make a sad , heedless young housekeeper to be sure , ” was her mother ’s foreboding remark ; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice .
Catherine Morland	Of a very considerable fortune , his son was , by marriage settlements , eventually secure ; his present income was an income of independence and comfort , and under every pecuniary view , it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter .
Catherine Morland	Henry returned to what was now his only home , to watch over his young plantations , and extend his improvements for her sake , to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward ; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry .
Catherine Morland	Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did — they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way .
Catherine Morland	The anxiety , which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine , and of all who loved either , as to its final event , can hardly extend , I fear , to the bosom of my readers , who will see in the tell - tale compression of the pages before them , that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity .
Catherine Morland	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ”
Catherine Morland	The marriage of Eleanor Tilney , her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry ’s banishment , to the home of her choice and the man of her choice , is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance .
Catherine Morland	Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin ; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her .
Catherine Morland	His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “ Your Ladyship ! ”
Catherine Morland	Her husband was really deserving of her ; independent of his peerage , his wealth , and his attachment , being to a precision the most charming young man in the world .
Catherine Morland	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give .
Catherine Morland	It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe ’s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it ; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor , and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds . This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride ; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence , which he was at some pains to procure , that the Fullerton estate , being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor , was consequently open to every greedy speculation .
Catherine Morland	On the strength of this , the General , soon after Eleanor ’s marriage , permitted his son to return to Northanger , and thence made him the bearer of his consent , very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland .
Catherine Morland	The event which it authorized soon followed : Henry and Catherine were married , the bells rang , and everybody smiled ; and , as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting
Catherine Morland	My dearest Catherine ,
Catherine Morland	I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight , and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner .
Catherine Morland	I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath , but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other .
Catherine Morland	Since you went away , I have had no pleasure in it — the dust is beyond anything ; and everybody one cares for is gone .
Catherine Morland	I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive .
Catherine Morland	I am quite uneasy about your dear brother , not having heard from him since he went to Oxford ; and am fearful of some misunderstanding .
Catherine Morland	Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it .
Catherine Morland	fashions are partly down ; and the hats the most frightful you can imagine .
Catherine Morland	I hope you spend your time pleasantly , but am afraid you never think of me .
Catherine Morland	I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together .
Catherine Morland	You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away .
Catherine Morland	Such a contrast between him and your brother !
Catherine Morland	You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own .
Catherine Morland	I wear nothing but purple now : I know I look hideous in it , but no matter — it is your dear brother ’s favourite colour .
Catherine Morland	Lose no time , my dearest , sweetest Catherine , in writing to him and to me , Who ever am , etc . Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine .
Catherine Morland	Its inconsistencies , contradictions , and falsehood struck her from the very first .
Catherine Morland	She was ashamed of Isabella , and ashamed of having ever loved her .
Catherine Morland	Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty , and her demands impudent .
Catherine Morland	On Henry ’s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother ’s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation .
Catherine Morland	When she had finished it—“So much for Isabella , ” she cried , “ and for all our intimacy !
Catherine Morland	If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . ”
Catherine Morland	But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . ” Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness .
Catherine Morland	She resolved on not answering Isabella ’s letter , and tried to think no more of it .
Catherine Morland	1 No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine .
Catherine Morland	Her situation in life , the character of her father and mother , her own person and disposition , were all equally against her .
Catherine Morland	Her father was a clergyman , without being neglected , or poor , and a very respectable man , though his name was Richard — and he had never been handsome .
Catherine Morland	Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense , with a good temper , and , what is more remarkable , with a good constitution .
Catherine Morland	She had three sons before Catherine was born ; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world , as anybody might expect , she still lived on — lived to have six children more — to see them growing up around her , and to enjoy excellent health herself .
Catherine Morland	A family of ten children will be always called a fine family , where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number ; but the Morlands had little other right to the word , for they were in general very plain , and Catherine , for many years of her life , as plain as any .
Catherine Morland	She had a thin awkward figure , a sallow skin without colour , dark lank hair , and strong features — so much for her person ; and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind .
Catherine Morland	She was fond of all boys ’ plays , and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls , but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy , nursing a dormouse , feeding a canary - bird , or watering a rose - bush .
Catherine Morland	Indeed she had no taste for a garden ; and if she gathered flowers at all , it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief — at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take . Such were her propensities — her abilities were quite as extraordinary .
Catherine Morland	She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught ; and sometimes not even then , for she was often inattentive , and occasionally stupid .
Catherine Morland	Her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the “ Beggar ’s Petition ” ; and after all , her next sister , Sally , could say it better than she did .
Catherine Morland	Not that Catherine was always stupid — by no means ; she learnt the fable of “ The Hare and Many Friends ” as quickly as any girl in England .
Catherine Morland	Her mother wished her to learn music ; and Catherine was sure she should like it , for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet
Catherine Morland	; so , at eight years old she began .
Catherine Morland	She learnt a year , and could not bear it ; and Mrs. Morland , who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste , allowed her to leave off .
Catherine Morland	The day which dismissed the music - master was one of the happiest of Catherine ’s life .
Catherine Morland	Her taste for drawing was not superior ; though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper , she did what she could in that way , by drawing houses and trees , hens and chickens , all very much like one another .
Catherine Morland	Writing and accounts she was taught by her father ; French by her mother : her proficiency in either was not remarkable , and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could .
Catherine Morland	What a strange , unaccountable character!—for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old , she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper , was seldom stubborn , scarcely ever quarrelsome , and very kind to the little ones , with few interruptions of tyranny ; she was moreover noisy and wild , hated confinement and cleanliness , and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house .
Catherine Morland	Such was Catherine Morland at ten .
Catherine Morland	At fifteen , appearances were mending ; she began to curl her hair and long for balls ; her complexion improved , her features were softened by plumpness and colour , her eyes gained more animation , and her figure more consequence .
Catherine Morland	Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery , and she grew clean as she grew smart ; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement .
Catherine Morland	“ Catherine grows quite a good - looking girl — she is almost pretty to - day , ” were words which caught her ears now and then ; and how welcome were the sounds !
Catherine Morland	Mrs. Morland was a very good woman , and wished to see her children everything they ought to be ; but her time was so much occupied in lying - in and teaching the little ones , that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves ; and it was not very wonderful that Catherine , who had by nature nothing heroic about her , should prefer cricket , baseball , riding on horseback , and running about the country at the age of fourteen , to books — or at least books of information — for , provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them , provided they were all story and no reflection , she had never any objection to books at all .
Catherine Morland	But from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine ; she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives .
Catherine Morland	From Pope , she learnt to censure those who “ bear about the mockery of woe . ”
Catherine Morland	And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information — amongst the rest , that — “ Trifles light as air , “ Are , to the jealous , confirmation strong , “ As proofs of Holy Writ . ” That “ The poor beetle , which we tread upon , “ In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great “ As when a giant dies . ” And that a young woman in love always looks — “ like Patience on a monument “ Smiling at Grief . ” So far her improvement was sufficient — and in many other points she came on exceedingly well ; for though she could not write sonnets , she brought herself to read them ; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte , of her own composition , she could listen to other people ’s performance with very little fatigue .
Catherine Morland	Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil — she had no notion of drawing — not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover ’s profile , that she might be detected in the design .
Catherine Morland	There she fell miserably short of the true heroic height .
Catherine Morland	At present she did not know her own poverty , for she had no lover to portray .
Catherine Morland	She had reached the age of seventeen , without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility , without having inspired one real passion , and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient .
Catherine Morland	Her father had no ward , and the squire of the parish no children . But when a young lady is to be a heroine , the perverseness of forty surrounding families can not prevent her .
Catherine Morland	Mr. Allen , who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton , the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived , was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution — and his lady , a good - humoured woman , fond of Miss Morland , and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village , she must seek them abroad , invited her to go with them .
Catherine Morland	Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance , and Catherine all happiness .
Catherine Morland	It was Sunday , and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the General in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home ; and great as was Catherine ’s curiosity , her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner , either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o’clock , or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp .
Catherine Morland	The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney , which immediately fronted the family pew .
Catherine Morland	By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained ; and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph , in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband , who must have been in some way or other her destroyer , affected her even to tears .
Catherine Morland	That the General , having erected such a monument , should be able to face it , was not perhaps very strange , and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view , maintain so elevated an air , look so fearlessly around , nay , that he should even enter the church , seemed wonderful to Catherine .
Catherine Morland	She could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice , going on from crime to crime , murdering whomsoever they chose , without any feeling of humanity or remorse ; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career .
Catherine Morland	The erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney ’s actual decease .
Catherine Morland	Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber , were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed — what could it avail in such a case ?
Catherine Morland	Catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced , and a supposititious funeral carried on . The succeeding morning promised something better .
Catherine Morland	The General ’s early walk , ill - timed as it was in every other view , was favourable here ; and when she knew him to be out of the house , she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise .
Catherine Morland	Eleanor was ready to oblige her ; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise , their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed - chamber .
Catherine Morland	they were not in every respect answered , for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features , hair , complexion , that should be the very counterpart , the very image , if not of Henry ’s , of Eleanor’s — the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking , bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child .
Catherine Morland	But here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness .
Catherine Morland	She contemplated it , however , in spite of this drawback , with much emotion , and , but for a yet stronger interest , would have left it unwillingly .
Catherine Morland	Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse ; she could only look at her companion .
Catherine Morland	Eleanor ’s countenance was dejected , yet sedate ; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing .
Catherine Morland	Again she passed through the folding doors , again her hand was upon the important lock , and Catherine , hardly able to breathe , was turning to close the former with fearful caution , when the figure , the dreaded figure of the General himself at the further end of the gallery , stood before her !
Catherine Morland	, resounded through the building , giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence , and to Catherine terror upon terror .
Catherine Morland	An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him , yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye ; and when her friend , who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her , had joined and disappeared with him , she ran for safety to her own room , and , locking herself in , believed that she should never have courage to go down again .
Catherine Morland	She remained there at least an hour , in the greatest agitation , deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend , and expecting a summons herself from the angry General to attend him in his own apartment .
Catherine Morland	No summons , however , arrived ; and at last , on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey , she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors .
Catherine Morland	The breakfast - room was gay with company ; and she was named to them by the General as the friend of his daughter , in a complimentary style , which so well concealed his resentful ire , as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present .
Catherine Morland	And Eleanor , with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character , taking an early occasion of saying to her , “ My father only wanted me to answer a note , ” she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the General , or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so .
Catherine Morland	Upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence , after the company left them , and nothing occurred to disturb it .
Catherine Morland	In the course of this morning ’s reflections , she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone .
Catherine Morland	To involve her in the danger of a second detection , to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart , could not be the office of a friend .
Catherine Morland	It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions , from which the other had , in all likelihood , been hitherto happily exempt ; nor could she therefore , in _ her _ presence , search for those proofs of the General ’s cruelty , which however they might yet have escaped discovery , she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth , in the shape of some fragmented journal , continued to the last gasp .
Catherine Morland	Of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress ; and as she wished to get it over before Henry ’s return , who was expected on the morrow , there was no time to be lost .
Catherine Morland	The day was bright , her courage high ; at four o’clock , the sun was now two hours above the horizon , and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual .
Catherine Morland	It was done ; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike .
Catherine Morland	It was no time for thought ; she hurried on , slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors , and without stopping to look or breathe , rushed forward to the one in question .
Catherine Morland	The lock yielded to her hand , and , luckily , with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being .
Catherine Morland	On tiptoe she entered ; the room was before her ; but it was some minutes before she could advance another step .
Catherine Morland	She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature .
Catherine Morland	She saw a large , well - proportioned apartment , an handsome dimity bed , arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid ’s care , a bright Bath stove , mahogany wardrobes , and neatly painted chairs , on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows !
Catherine Morland	Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked , and worked they were .
Catherine Morland	She could not be mistaken as to the room ; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!—in Miss Tilney ’s meaning , in her own calculation !
Catherine Morland	this apartment , to which she had given a date so ancient , a position so awful , proved to be one end of what the General ’s father had built .
Catherine Morland	There were two other doors in the chamber , leading probably into dressing - closets ; but she had no inclination to open either .
Catherine Morland	She was sick of exploring , and desired but to be safe in her own room , with her own heart only privy to its folly ; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered , when the sound of footsteps , she could hardly tell where , made her pause and tremble .
Catherine Morland	she listened — the sound had ceased ; and resolving not to lose a moment , she passed through and closed the door .
Catherine Morland	At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened ; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs , by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery .
Catherine Morland	She had no power to move .
Catherine Morland	With a feeling of terror not very definable , she fixed her eyes on the staircase , and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view .
Catherine Morland	“ Mr. Tilney ! ” she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment .
Catherine Morland	“ Good God ! ” she continued , not attending to his address .
Catherine Morland	Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford .
Catherine Morland	She moved on towards the gallery .
Catherine Morland	“ And may I not , in my turn , ” said he , as he pushed back the folding doors , “ ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I have been , ” said Catherine , looking down , “ to see your mother ’s room . ”
Catherine Morland	“ My mother ’s room !
Catherine Morland	I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . ” “ I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me .
Catherine Morland	You look pale .
Catherine Morland	I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs .
Catherine Morland	Perhaps you did not know — you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , I was not .
Catherine Morland	You have had a very fine day for your ride .
Catherine Morland	“ Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? ”
Catherine Morland	she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday — and we were coming here to these rooms — but only , ” dropping her voice , “ your father was with us . ” “ And that prevented you , ” said Henry , earnestly regarding her .
Catherine Morland	“ Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , I only wanted to see —
Catherine Morland	I must go and dress . ”
Catherine Morland	“ It is only a quarter past four , ” showing his watch ; “ and you are not now in Bath .
Catherine Morland	She could not contradict it , and therefore suffered herself to be detained , though her dread of further questions made her , for the first time in their acquaintance , wish to leave him .
Catherine Morland	“ Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , and I am very much surprised .
Catherine Morland	it is a power little worth knowing , however , since it can deceive and pain you .
Catherine Morland	She sent you to look at it , I suppose ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ It has been your own doing entirely ? ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine said nothing .
Catherine Morland	After a short silence , during which he had closely observed her , he added , “ As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity , this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother ’s character , as described by Eleanor , which does honour to her memory .
Catherine Morland	Her dying so suddenly ” ( slowly , and with hesitation it was spoken ) , “ and you — none of you being at home — and your father , I thought — perhaps had not been very fond of her . ” “ And from these circumstances , ” he replied ( his quick eye fixed on hers ) , “ you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence — some”—(involuntarily she shook her head)—“or it may be — of something still less pardonable . ”
Catherine Morland	She raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before .
Catherine Morland	“ But your father , ” said Catherine , “ was _ he _ afflicted ? ” “ For a time , greatly so .
Catherine Morland	You have erred in supposing him not attached to her .
Catherine Morland	He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to — we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition — and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did .
Catherine Morland	” “ I am very glad of it , ” said Catherine ; “ it would have been very shocking ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to — Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained .
Catherine Morland	What have you been judging from ?
Catherine Morland	Consult your own understanding , your own sense of the probable , your own observation of what is passing around you . Does our education prepare us for such atrocities ?
Catherine Morland	Dearest Miss Morland , what ideas have you been
Catherine Morland	” They had reached the end of the gallery , and with tears of shame she ran off to her own room .
Catherine Morland	’ Tis James ! ” was uttered at the same moment by Catherine ; and , on catching the young men ’s eyes , the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches , and the servant having now scampered up , the gentlemen jumped out , and the equipage was delivered to his care .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people ’s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself .
Catherine Morland	John Thorpe , who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses , soon joined them , and from him she directly received the amends which were her due ; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella , on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow .
Catherine Morland	He took out his watch : “ How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury , Miss Morland ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I do not know the distance . ”
Catherine Morland	Her brother told her that it was twenty - three miles .
Catherine Morland	Morland remonstrated , pleaded the authority of road - books , innkeepers , and milestones ; but his friend disregarded them all ; he had a surer test of distance .
Catherine Morland	It is now half after one ; we drove out of the inn - yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven ; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness ; that makes it exactly twenty - five . ” “ You have lost an hour , ” said Morland ; “ it was only ten o’clock when we came from Tetbury . ” “ Ten o’clock !
Catherine Morland	This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses , Miss Morland ; do but look at my horse ; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life ? ”
Catherine Morland	look at that creature , and suppose it possible if you can . ” “ He _ does _ look very hot , to be sure . ”
Catherine Morland	What do you think of my gig , Miss Morland ?
Catherine Morland	And how much do you think he did , Miss Morland ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am sure I can not guess at all . ” “ Curricle - hung , you see ; seat , trunk , sword - case , splashing - board , lamps , silver moulding , all you see complete ; the iron - work as good as new , or better .
Catherine Morland	He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . ” “ And I am sure , ” said Catherine , “ I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . ” “ Neither one nor t’other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . ” “ That was very good - natured of you , ” said Catherine , quite pleased .
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! d — — it , when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend , I hate to be pitiful . ”
Catherine Morland	satisfied was the latter with her lot , so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother ’s friend , and her friend ’s brother , so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings , that , though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street , she was so far from seeking to attract their notice , that she looked back at them only three times .
Catherine Morland	John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine , and , after a few minutes ’ silence , renewed the conversation about his gig .
Catherine Morland	“ You will find , however , Miss Morland , it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people , for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day ; Jackson , of Oriel , bid me sixty at once ; Morland was with me at the time . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , ” said Morland , who overheard this ; “ but you forget that your horse was included . ” “ My horse !
Catherine Morland	Are you fond of an open carriage , Miss Morland ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , very ; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one ; but I am particularly fond of it . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Thank you , ” said Catherine , in some distress , from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer .
Catherine Morland	“ I will drive you up Lansdown Hill to - morrow . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Shall you indeed ! ” said Catherine very seriously .
Catherine Morland	“ Forty ! aye , fifty , for what I care . Well , I will drive you up Lansdown to - morrow ; mind , I am engaged . ”
Catherine Morland	My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother ,
Catherine Morland	morland must take care of you . ”
Catherine Morland	This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two ; but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result .
Catherine Morland	Her companion ’s discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met ; and Catherine , after listening and agreeing as long as she could , with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind , fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self - assured man , especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned , ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts ; it was , “ Have you ever read Udolpho , Mr. Thorpe ? ” “ Udolpho !
Catherine Morland	not I ; I never read novels ; I have something else to do . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine , humbled and ashamed , was going to apologize for her question , but he prevented her by saying , “ Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff ; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones , except The Monk ; I read that t’other day ; but as for all the others , they are the stupidest things in creation . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I think you must like Udolpho , if you were to read it ; it is so very interesting . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Not I , faith !
Catherine Morland	no , if I read any , it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe ’s ; her novels are amusing enough ; they are worth reading ; some fun and nature in _ them _ . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe , ” said Catherine , with some hesitation , from the fear of mortifying him .
Catherine Morland	“ I suppose you mean Camilla ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I have never read it . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You had no loss , I assure you ; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine ; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man ’s playing at see - saw and learning Latin ; upon my soul there is not . ”
Catherine Morland	Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you , so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near . ”
Catherine Morland	These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening .
Catherine Morland	Had she been older or vainer , such attacks might have done little ; but , where youth and diffidence are united , it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world , and of being so very early engaged as a partner ; and the consequence was that , when the two Morlands , after sitting an hour with the Thorpes , set off to walk together to Mr. Allen ’s , and James , as the door was closed on them , said , “ Well , Catherine , how do you like
Catherine Morland	” instead of answering , as she probably would have done , had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case , “ I do not like him at all , ” she directly replied , “ I like him very much ; he seems very agreeable .
Catherine Morland	“ He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you .
Catherine Morland	She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be ; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you , Catherine , ” taking her hand with affection , “ may be proud of . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Indeed I am , ” she replied ; “ I love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too .
Catherine Morland	You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Because I thought I should soon see you myself .
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , very much indeed , I fancy ; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath . ”
Catherine Morland	I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , very kind ; I never was so happy before ; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever ; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _ me _ . ”
Catherine Morland	James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , “ Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . ” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James ’s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet .
Catherine Morland	The time of the two parties uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted , Catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised , restless , and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho , lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner , incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen ’s fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker , and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity , in being already engaged for the evening .
Catherine Morland	They will hardly follow us there . ” Away they walked to the book ; and while Isabella examined the names , it was Catherine ’s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men . “ They are not coming this way , are they ?
Catherine Morland	In a few moments Catherine , with unaffected pleasure , assured her that she need not be longer uneasy , as the gentlemen had just left the pump - room .
Catherine Morland	and now , what say you to going to Edgar ’s Buildings with me , and looking at my new hat
Catherine Morland	You said you should like to see it . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine readily agreed .
Catherine Morland	“ Only , ” she added , “ perhaps we may overtake the two young men . ”
Catherine Morland	If we make haste , we shall pass by them presently , and I am dying to show you my hat .
Catherine Morland	“ But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . ” “ I shall not pay them any such compliment , I assure you .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning ; and therefore , to show the independence of Miss Thorpe , and her resolution of humbling the sex , they set off immediately as fast as they could walk , in pursuit of the two young men .
Catherine Morland	28 Soon after this , the General found himself obliged to go to London for a week ; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland ’s company , and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence .
Catherine Morland	She had “ hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time — had been misled ( perhaps by her wishes ) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised — and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there , they would be too generous to hasten her return . ”
Catherine Morland	His departure gave Catherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain .
Catherine Morland	The happiness with which their time now passed , every employment voluntary , every laugh indulged , every meal a scene of ease and good humour , walking where they liked and when they liked , their hours , pleasures , and fatigues at their own command , made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the General ’s presence had imposed , and most thankfully feel their present release from it .
Catherine Morland	Such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day ; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one , and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other , she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy ; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit ; before the General came home , the fourth week would be turned , and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer .
Catherine Morland	This was a painful consideration whenever it occurred ; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind , she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once , propose going away , and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken .
Catherine Morland	Aware that if she gave herself much time , she might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject , she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone with Eleanor , and of Eleanor ’s being in the middle of a speech about something very different , to start forth her obligation of going away very soon .
Catherine Morland	Catherine explained : “ Oh ! as to _ that _ , Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all .
Catherine Morland	“ Nay , if you can use such a word , I can urge you no farther .
Catherine Morland	If you think it long — ” “ Oh ! no , I do not indeed .
Catherine Morland	And it was directly settled that , till she had , her leaving them was not even to be thought of .
Catherine Morland	Henry ’s gratified look on being told that her stay was determined , were such sweet proofs of her importance with them , as left her only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without .
Catherine Morland	She did — almost always — believe that Henry loved her , and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them ; and believing so far , her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations .
Catherine Morland	Catherine walked on to her chamber , making up her mind as well as she could , to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney , and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her , and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her , that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful .
Catherine Morland	She trusted he would never speak of Miss Thorpe ; and indeed , as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted
Catherine Morland	, there could be no danger of it ; and as long as all mention of Bath scenes were avoided , she thought she could behave to him very civilly .
Catherine Morland	In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent .
Catherine Morland	Scarcely , however , had she convicted her fancy of error , when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start ; it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway — and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it .
Catherine Morland	She trembled a little at the idea of anyone ’s approaching so cautiously ; but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm , or misled by a raised imagination , she stepped quietly forward , and opened the door .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s spirits , however , were tranquillized but for an instant , for Eleanor ’s cheeks were pale , and her manner greatly agitated .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney ’s account
Catherine Morland	, could only express her concern by silent attention , obliged her to be seated , rubbed her temples with lavender water , and hung over her with affectionate solicitude .
Catherine Morland	“ My dear Catherine , you must not — you must not indeed — ” were Eleanor ’s first connected words .
Catherine Morland	This kindness distracts me — I can not bear it — I come to you on such an errand ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Errand ! to me ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ How shall I tell you !
Catherine Morland	how shall I tell you ! ”
Catherine Morland	A new idea now darted into Catherine ’s mind , and turning as pale as her friend , she exclaimed , “ ’ Tis a messenger from Woodston ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ You are mistaken , indeed , ” returned Eleanor , looking at her most compassionately ; “ it is no one from Woodston .
Catherine Morland	His unlooked - for return was enough in itself to make Catherine ’s heart sink , and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told .
Catherine Morland	She said nothing ; and Eleanor , endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness , but with eyes still cast down , soon went on .
Catherine Morland	“ You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform .
Catherine Morland	After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words .
Catherine Morland	My dear Catherine , we are to part .
Catherine Morland	“ My dear Eleanor , ” cried Catherine , suppressing her feelings as well as she could , “ do not be so distressed .
Catherine Morland	I am very , very sorry we are to part — so soon , and so suddenly too ; but I am not offended , indeed I am not .
Catherine Morland	I can finish my visit here , you know , at any time ; or I hope you will come to me .
Catherine Morland	Can you , when you return from this lord ’s , come to Fullerton ?
Catherine Morland	” “ It will not be in my power , Catherine . ” “ Come when you can , then . ”
Catherine Morland	Eleanor made no answer ; and Catherine ’s thoughts recurring to something more directly interesting , she added , thinking aloud , “ Monday — so soon as Monday ; and you _ all _ go .
Catherine Morland	Well , I am certain of — I shall be able to take leave , however .
Catherine Morland	I need not go till just before you do , you know .
Catherine Morland	Do not be distressed , Eleanor , I can go on Monday very well .
Catherine Morland	My father and mother ’s
Catherine Morland	The General will send a servant with me , I dare say , half the way — and then I shall soon be at Salisbury , and then I am only nine miles from home . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Ah , Catherine !
Catherine Morland	were it settled so , it would be somewhat less intolerable , though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought .
Catherine Morland	But — how can I tell you?—to - morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o’clock , and no servant will be offered you . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine sat down , breathless and speechless .
Catherine Morland	“ I could hardly believe my senses , when I heard it ; and no displeasure , no resentment that you can feel at this moment , however justly great , can be more than I myself — but I must not talk of what I felt .
Catherine Morland	that I could suggest anything in extenuation !
Catherine Morland	what will your father and mother say !
Catherine Morland	after courting you from the protection of real friends to this — almost double distance from your home , to have you driven out of the house , without the considerations even of decent civility !
Catherine Morland	dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Have I offended the General ? ” said Catherine in a faltering voice .
Catherine Morland	for my feelings as a daughter , all that I know , all that I answer for , is that you can have given him no just cause of offence .
Catherine Morland	His temper is not happy , and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree ; some disappointment , some vexation , which just at this moment seems important , but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in , for how is it possible ?
Catherine Morland	It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all ; and it was only for Eleanor ’s sake that she attempted it .
Catherine Morland	“ I am sure , ” said she , “ I am very sorry if I have offended him .
Catherine Morland	It was the last thing I would willingly have done .
Catherine Morland	I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner , that I might have written home .
Catherine Morland	“ I hope , I earnestly hope , that to your real safety it will be of none ; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence : to comfort , appearance , propriety , to your family , to the world .
Catherine Morland	Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! ”
Catherine Morland	And if we are to part , a few hours sooner or later , you know , makes no difference .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s swelling heart needed relief .
Catherine Morland	Eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion , but Catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected , or , at least , not supposed to be connected with it .
Catherine Morland	That room , in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival , was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers .
Catherine Morland	Yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then
Catherine Morland	her anxiety had foundation in fact , her fears in probability ; and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil , the solitude of her situation , the darkness of her chamber , the antiquity of the building , were felt and considered without the smallest emotion ; and though the wind was high , and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house , she heard it all as she lay awake , hour after hour , without curiosity or terror .
Catherine Morland	Soon after six Eleanor entered her room , eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible ; but very little remained to be done .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared .
Catherine Morland	And she only wanted to know how far , after what had passed , an apology might properly be received by her .
Catherine Morland	Very little passed between them on meeting ; each found her greatest safety in silence , and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs , Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress , and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk .
Catherine Morland	When everything was done they left the room , Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well - known , cherished object , and went down to the breakfast - parlour , where breakfast was prepared .
Catherine Morland	She tried to eat , as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable ; but she had no appetite , and could not swallow many mouthfuls .
Catherine Morland	The contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery , and strengthened her distaste for everything before her .
Catherine Morland	with what cheerful ease , what happy , though false , security , had she then looked around her , enjoying everything present , and fearing little in future , beyond Henry ’s going to Woodston for a day !
Catherine Morland	for Henry had been there ; Henry had sat by her and helped her .
Catherine Morland	These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion , who sat as deep in thought as herself ; and the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the present moment .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s colour rose at the sight of it ; and the indignity with which she was treated , striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force , made her for a short time sensible only of resentment .
Catherine Morland	“ You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , ” she cried ; “ you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible .
Catherine Morland	Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour ’s comfort .
Catherine Morland	Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more .
Catherine Morland	“ No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write .
Catherine Morland	There can be no doubt of my getting home safe . ”
Catherine Morland	Eleanor only replied , “ I can not wonder at your feelings .
Catherine Morland	I will not importune you .
Catherine Morland	I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . ”
Catherine Morland	But this , with the look of sorrow accompanying it , was enough to melt Catherine ’s pride in a moment , and she instantly said , “ Oh , Eleanor , I _ will _ write to you indeed .
Catherine Morland	It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home , Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey , and , upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation , it proved to be exactly the case .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment , but , upon examining her purse , was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend , she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home ; and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both , scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together .
Catherine Morland	The carriage was soon announced to be ready ; and Catherine , instantly rising , a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu ; and , as they entered the hall , unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either
Catherine Morland	, she paused a moment , and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left “ her kind remembrance for her absent friend . ”
Catherine Morland	But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings ; and , hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief , she darted across the hall , jumped into the chaise , and in a moment was driven from the door .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was completely awakened .
Catherine Morland	Henry ’s address , short as it had been , had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done .
Catherine Morland	Most grievously was she humbled .
Catherine Morland	Most bitterly did she cry .
Catherine Morland	It was not only with herself that she was sunk — but with Henry .
Catherine Morland	Her folly , which now seemed even criminal , was all exposed to him , and he must despise her forever .
Catherine Morland	The liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father — could he ever forgive it ?
Catherine Morland	The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears — could they ever be forgotten ?
Catherine Morland	She hated herself more than she could express .
Catherine Morland	He had — she thought he had , once or twice before this fatal morning , shown something like affection for her .
Catherine Morland	But now — in short , she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour , went down when the clock struck five , with a broken heart , and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor ’s inquiry if she was well .
Catherine Morland	The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room , and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had never wanted comfort more , and he looked as if he was aware of it .
Catherine Morland	The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness ; and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity .
Catherine Morland	She did not learn either to forget or defend the past ; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther , and that it might not cost her Henry ’s entire regard .
Catherine Morland	Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done , nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary , self - created delusion , each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm , and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which , before she entered the abbey , had been craving to be frightened . She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of Northanger .
Catherine Morland	She saw that the infatuation had been created , the mischief settled , long before her quitting Bath , and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged .
Catherine Morland	Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country , and even of that , if hard pressed , would have yielded the northern and western extremities .
Catherine Morland	But in England it was not so ; among the English , she believed , in their hearts and habits , there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad .
Catherine Morland	Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable .
Catherine Morland	Her mind made up on these several points , and her resolution formed , of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense , she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever ; and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day .
Catherine Morland	Henry ’s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct , in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed , was of the greatest assistance to her ; and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress , her spirits became absolutely comfortable , and capable , as heretofore , of continual improvement by anything he said .
Catherine Morland	There were still some subjects , indeed , under which she believed they must always tremble — the mention of a chest or a cabinet , for instance — and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape : but even _ she _ could allow that an occasional memento of past folly , however painful , might not be without use .
Catherine Morland	Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater .
Catherine Morland	She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella ’s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James .
Catherine Morland	Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella .
Catherine Morland	James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton .
Catherine Morland	For nine successive mornings , Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment , which each morning became more severe : but , on the tenth , when she entered the breakfast - room , her first object was a letter , held out by Henry ’s willing hand .
Catherine Morland	She thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself .
Catherine Morland	“ ’ Tis only from James , however , ” as she looked at the direction .
Catherine Morland	She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : “ Dear Catherine , “ Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me .
Catherine Morland	I shall not enter into particulars — they would only pain you more .
Catherine Morland	You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God !
Catherine Morland	after my father ’s consent had been so kindly given — but no more of this .
Catherine Morland	let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; _ your _ love I do build upon .
Catherine Morland	I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced .
Catherine Morland	i can never expect to know such another woman !
Catherine Morland	Dearest Catherine , beware how you give your heart .
Catherine Morland	“ Believe me , ” & c. Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began .
Catherine Morland	They went to breakfast directly ; but Catherine could hardly eat anything .
Catherine Morland	Tears filled her eyes , and even ran down her cheeks as she sat .
Catherine Morland	The letter was one moment in her hand , then in her lap , and then in her pocket ; and she looked as if she knew not what she did .
Catherine Morland	The General , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible .
Catherine Morland	As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room ; but the housemaids were busy in it , and she was obliged to come down again .
Catherine Morland	She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her .
Catherine Morland	She drew back , trying to beg their pardon , but was , with gentle violence , forced to return ; and the others withdrew , after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her . After half an hour ’s free indulgence of grief and reflection , Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends ; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration .
Catherine Morland	Perhaps , if particularly questioned , she might just give an idea — just distantly hint at it — but not more .
Catherine Morland	To expose a friend , such a friend as Isabella had been to her — and then their own brother so closely concerned in it !
Catherine Morland	She believed she must waive the subject altogether .
Catherine Morland	Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast - room ; and each , as she entered it , looked at her anxiously .
Catherine Morland	Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , “ No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ?
Catherine Morland	Mr. and Mrs. Morland — your brothers and sisters — I hope they are none of them ill ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , I thank you ” ( sighing as she spoke ) ; “ they are all very well .
Catherine Morland	My letter was from my brother at Oxford . ”
Catherine Morland	Nothing further was said for a few minutes ; and then speaking through her tears , she added , “ I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , ” replied Henry warmly , “ must be a comfort to him under any distress . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I have one favour to beg , ” said Catherine , shortly afterwards , in an agitated manner , “ that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ”
Catherine Morland	“ How quick you are ! ” cried Catherine : “ you have guessed it , I declare !
Catherine Morland	Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours !
Catherine Morland	could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ” “ I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed .
Catherine Morland	I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland ’s disappointment .
Catherine Morland	I think you must be deceived so far .
Catherine Morland	I am very sorry for Mr. Morland — sorry that
Catherine Morland	you love should be unhappy
Catherine Morland	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer .
Catherine Morland	“ I do not know what I was thinking of ” ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; “ James only means to give me good advice . ”
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney , at Catherine ’s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe ’s connections and fortune .
Catherine Morland	“ Her mother is a very good sort of woman , ” was Catherine ’s answer .
Catherine Morland	I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family .
Catherine Morland	Your father is so very liberal !
Catherine Morland	The brother and sister looked at each other .
Catherine Morland	She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so .
Catherine Morland	Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . ” “ Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , ” said Eleanor with a smile .
Catherine Morland	“ But perhaps , ” observed Catherine , “ though she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours .
Catherine Morland	I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . ” “ You think it is all for ambition , then ?
Catherine Morland	And , upon my word , there are some things that seem very like it .
Catherine Morland	I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more .
Catherine Morland	I never was so deceived in anyone ’s character in my life before . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . ”
Catherine Morland	“ My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it .
Catherine Morland	“ Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours .
Catherine Morland	You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy .
Catherine Morland	Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent .
Catherine Morland	You would not , for instance , now go to a ball for the world .
Catherine Morland	You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve , on whose regard you can place dependence , or whose counsel , in any difficulty , you could rely on .
Catherine Morland	You feel all this ?
Catherine Morland	” “ No , ” said Catherine , after a few moments ’ reflection , “ I do not — ought I ?
Catherine Morland	To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought
Catherine Morland	“ You feel , as you always do , what is most to the credit of human nature .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , by some chance or other , found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on , though so unaccountably , to mention the circumstance which had produced it .
Catherine Morland	My dearest Catherine ,
Catherine Morland	I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight , and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner .
Catherine Morland	I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath , but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other .
Catherine Morland	Since you went away , I have had no pleasure in it — the dust is beyond anything ; and everybody one cares for is gone .
Catherine Morland	I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive .
Catherine Morland	I am quite uneasy about your dear brother , not having heard from him since he went to Oxford ; and am fearful of some misunderstanding .
Catherine Morland	Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it .
Catherine Morland	fashions are partly down ; and the hats the most frightful you can imagine .
Catherine Morland	I hope you spend your time pleasantly , but am afraid you never think of me .
Catherine Morland	I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together .
Catherine Morland	You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away .
Catherine Morland	Such a contrast between him and your brother !
Catherine Morland	You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own .
Catherine Morland	I wear nothing but purple now : I know I look hideous in it , but no matter — it is your dear brother ’s favourite colour .
Catherine Morland	Lose no time , my dearest , sweetest Catherine , in writing to him and to me , Who ever am , etc . Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine .
Catherine Morland	Its inconsistencies , contradictions , and falsehood struck her from the very first .
Catherine Morland	She was ashamed of Isabella , and ashamed of having ever loved her .
Catherine Morland	Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty , and her demands impudent .
Catherine Morland	On Henry ’s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother ’s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation .
Catherine Morland	When she had finished it—“So much for Isabella , ” she cried , “ and for all our intimacy !
Catherine Morland	she must think me an idiot , or she could not have written so ; but perhaps this has served to make
Catherine Morland	character better known to me than mine is to her
Catherine Morland	I see what she has been about .
Catherine Morland	I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her .
Catherine Morland	“ It will soon be as if you never had , ” said Henry .
Catherine Morland	“ I have very little to say for Frederick ’s motives , such as I believe them to have been .
Catherine Morland	If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am persuaded that he never did . ” “ And only made believe to do so for mischief ’s sake ? ” Henry bowed his assent .
Catherine Morland	“ Well , then , I must say that I do not like him at all .
Catherine Morland	Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all .
Catherine Morland	As it happens , there is no great harm done , because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose .
Catherine Morland	“ But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose — consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . ” “ It is very right that you should stand by your brother . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe .
Catherine Morland	But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . ” Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness .
Catherine Morland	She resolved on not answering Isabella ’s letter , and tried to think no more of it .
Catherine Morland	what was there to interest or amuse her ?
Catherine Morland	She was tired of the woods and the shrubberies — always so smooth and so dry ; and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house .
Catherine Morland	What a revolution in her ideas !
Catherine Morland	she , who had so longed to be in an abbey !
Catherine Morland	now , there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well - connected parsonage , something like Fullerton , but better :
Catherine Morland	It came — it was fine — and Catherine trod on air .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler ’s shops which they passed .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s mind was too full , as she entered the house , for her either to observe or to say a great deal ; and , till called on by the General for her opinion of it , she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting .
Catherine Morland	Upon looking round it then , she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world ; but she was too guarded to say so , and the coldness of her praise disappointed him .
Catherine Morland	Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits .
Catherine Morland	The room in question was of a commodious , well - proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining - parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing - room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the General .
Catherine Morland	It was a prettily shaped room , the windows reaching to the ground , and the view from them pleasant , though only over green meadows ; and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it .
Catherine Morland	it is the prettiest room I ever saw ; it is the prettiest room in the world ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well , if it was my house , I should never sit anywhere else .
Catherine Morland	“ You like it — you approve it as an object — it is enough .
Catherine Morland	” Such a compliment recalled all Catherine ’s consciousness , and silenced her directly ; and , though pointedly applied to by the General for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings , nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her .
Catherine Morland	, however , was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations ; and , having reached the ornamental part of the premises , consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow , on which Henry ’s genius had begun to act about half a year ago , she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure - ground she had ever been in before , though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner .
Catherine Morland	A saunter into other meadows , and through part of the village , with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements , and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about , brought them to four o’clock , when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three .
Catherine Morland	She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the General ; nay , that he was even looking at the side - table for cold meat which was not there .
Catherine Morland	They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own , and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter ’s being oiled . At six o’clock , the General having taken his coffee , the carriage again received them ; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit , so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations , that , could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son , Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was too wretched to be fearful .
Catherine Morland	The journey in itself had no terrors for her ; and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness .
Catherine Morland	Leaning back in one corner of the carriage , in a violent burst of tears , she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head ; and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it .
Catherine Morland	Unfortunately , the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from Woodston ; and , for fourteen miles , every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different .
Catherine Morland	Every mile , as it brought her nearer Woodston , added to her sufferings , and when within the distance of five , she passed the turning which led to it , and thought of Henry , so near , yet so unconscious , her grief and agitation were excessive .
Catherine Morland	The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life .
Catherine Morland	It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage .
Catherine Morland	Yes , only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard — had he even confused her by his too significant reference ! and now — what had she done , or what had she omitted to do , to merit such a change ?
Catherine Morland	The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge .
Catherine Morland	Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained ; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each .
Catherine Morland	Designedly , at least , Henry could not have betrayed her .
Catherine Morland	If , indeed , by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for , of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations , she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation .
Catherine Morland	If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer , she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house .
Catherine Morland	But a justification so full of torture to herself , she trusted , would not be in his power .
Catherine Morland	Anxious as were all her conjectures on this point , it was not , however , the one on which she dwelt most .
Catherine Morland	How Henry would think , and feel , and look , when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her being gone , was a question of force and interest to rise over every other , to be never ceasing , alternately irritating and soothing ; it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence , and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment .
Catherine Morland	To the General , of course , he would not dare to speak ; but to Eleanor — what might he not say to Eleanor about her ?
Catherine Morland	In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries , on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose , the hours passed away , and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for .
Catherine Morland	The pressing anxieties of thought , which prevented her from noticing anything before her , when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston , saved her at the same time from watching her progress ; and though no object on the road could engage a moment ’s attention , she found no stage of it tedious .
Catherine Morland	From this , she was preserved too by another cause , by feeling no eagerness for her journey ’s conclusion ; for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best , even after an absence such as hers — an eleven weeks ’ absence .
Catherine Morland	What had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family , that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it , extend an useless resentment , and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will ?
Catherine Morland	She
Catherine Morland	could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor ’s merit ; she felt it too strongly for expression ; and should a dislike be taken against them , should they be thought of unfavourably , on their father ’s account , it would cut her to the heart .
Catherine Morland	With these feelings , she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well - known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home .
Catherine Morland	Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger ; but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post - masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it ; so great had been her ignorance of her route .
Catherine Morland	She met with nothing , however , to distress or frighten her .
Catherine Morland	Her youth , civil manners , and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require ; and stopping only to change horses , she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm , and between six and seven o’clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton .
Catherine Morland	But , whatever might be the distress of Catherine ’s mind , as she thus advanced towards the parsonage , and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it , she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went ; first , in the appearance of her carriage — and secondly , in herself .
Catherine Morland	Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine !
Catherine Morland	Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine ’s heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible .
Catherine Morland	So surrounded , so caressed , she was even happy !
Catherine Morland	in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued , and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity , they were all seated round the tea - table , which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller , whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice , before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her .
Catherine Morland	Reluctantly , and with much hesitation , did she then begin what might perhaps , at the end of half an hour , be termed , by the courtesy of her hearers , an explanation ; but scarcely , within that time , could they at all discover the cause , or collect the particulars , of her sudden return .
Catherine Morland	here , when the whole was unfolded , was an insult not to be overlooked , nor , for the first half hour , to be easily pardoned . Without suffering any romantic alarm , in the consideration of their daughter ’s long and lonely journey , Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her ; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered ; and that , in forcing her on such a measure , General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly — neither as a gentleman nor as a parent .
Catherine Morland	Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that “ it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , ” grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour .
Catherine Morland	“ My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , ” said her mother at last ; “ depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , ” said Sarah , “ but why not do it civilly ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am sorry for the young people , ” returned Mrs. Morland ; “ they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General
Catherine Morland	Catherine sighed .
Catherine Morland	“ Well , ” continued her philosophic mother , “ I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done .
Catherine Morland	It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets .
Catherine Morland	Catherine hoped so too , and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment , but her spirits were quite worn down ; and , to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish , she readily agreed to her mother ’s next counsel of going early to bed .
Catherine Morland	Her parents , seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified
Catherine Morland	parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away ; and though , when they all met the next morning , her recovery was not equal to their hopes , they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil .
Catherine Morland	They never once thought of her heart , which , for the parents of a young lady of seventeen , just returned from her first excursion from home , was odd enough !
Catherine Morland	As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend ’s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure .
Catherine Morland	The strength of these feelings , however , was far from assisting her pen ; and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor Tilney .
Catherine Morland	To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation , convey gratitude without servile regret , be guarded without coldness , and honest without resentment — a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of — and , above all , which she might not blush herself , if Henry should chance to see , was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance ; and , after long thought and much perplexity , to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety .
Catherine Morland	The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks , and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart .
Catherine Morland	I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella .
Catherine Morland	well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine coloured as she warmly answered , “ No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . ”
Catherine Morland	“ If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy .
Catherine Morland	It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in
Catherine Morland	The hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into Catherine ’s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her .
Catherine Morland	She could never forget Henry Tilney , or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment ; but he might forget her ; and in that case , to meet — !
Catherine Morland	her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment .
Catherine Morland	” This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could listen to ; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance , and made her reply less rational ; for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well - known road .
Catherine Morland	It was not three months ago since , wild with joyful expectation , she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day , with an heart light , gay , and independent ; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed , and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it .
Catherine Morland	Three months ago had seen her all this ; and now , how altered a being did she return !
Catherine Morland	She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked - for appearance , acting on a steady affection , would naturally call forth ; and great was their surprise , and warm their displeasure , on hearing how she had been treated — though Mrs. Morland ’s account of it was no inflated representation , no studied appeal to their passions .
Catherine Morland	“ Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , ” said she .
Catherine Morland	“ She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house .
Catherine Morland	Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again !
Catherine Morland	and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ” Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself .
Catherine Morland	A more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition ; and , after completing the fourth , she immediately added , “ Only think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was .
Catherine Morland	I must show it you some day or other .
Catherine Morland	Bath is a nice place , Catherine , after all .
Catherine Morland	I assure you I did not above half like coming away .
Catherine Morland	You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , but _ that _ did not last long , ” said Catherine , her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there .
Catherine Morland	My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ?
Catherine Morland	I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since .
Catherine Morland	Do you remember that evening ? ” “ Do I ! oh ! perfectly . ” “ It was very agreeable , was not it ?
Catherine Morland	I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure .
Catherine Morland	Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I really have not patience with the General !
Catherine Morland	His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them , Catherine .
Catherine Morland	But no wonder ; Milsom Street , you know .
Catherine Morland	As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter ’s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends .
Catherine Morland	There was a great deal of good sense in all this ; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power ; and Catherine ’s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced .
Catherine Morland	It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening , in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe , though they certainly claimed much of her leisure , as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach ; but she looked in vain .
Catherine Morland	She hoped to be more fortunate the next day ; and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning , she hardly felt a doubt of it ; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants , and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is .
Catherine Morland	Here Catherine and Isabella , arm in arm , again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation ; they talked much , and with much enjoyment ; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner .
Catherine Morland	He was nowhere to be met with ; every search for him was equally unsuccessful , in morning lounges or evening assemblies ; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms , at dressed or undressed balls , was he perceivable ; nor among the walkers , the horsemen , or the curricle - drivers of the morning .
Catherine Morland	His name was not in the pump - room book , and curiosity could do no more .
Catherine Morland	He must be gone from Bath .
Catherine Morland	Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short !
Catherine Morland	this sort of mysteriousness , which is always so becoming in a hero , threw a fresh grace in Catherine ’s imagination around his person and manners , and increased her anxiety to know more of him .
Catherine Morland	From the Thorpes she could learn nothing , for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen .
Catherine Morland	It was a subject , however , in which she often indulged with her fair friend , from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him ; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken .
Catherine Morland	Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man , and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine , and would therefore shortly return .
Catherine Morland	She liked him the better for being a clergyman , “ for she must confess herself very partial to the profession ” ; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it .
Catherine Morland	Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion — but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love , or the duties of friendship , to know when delicate raillery was properly called for , or when a confidence should be forced .
Catherine Morland	The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm , and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was completely awakened .
Catherine Morland	Henry ’s address , short as it had been , had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done .
Catherine Morland	Most grievously was she humbled .
Catherine Morland	Most bitterly did she cry .
Catherine Morland	It was not only with herself that she was sunk — but with Henry .
Catherine Morland	Her folly , which now seemed even criminal , was all exposed to him , and he must despise her forever .
Catherine Morland	The liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father — could he ever forgive it ?
Catherine Morland	The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears — could they ever be forgotten ?
Catherine Morland	She hated herself more than she could express .
Catherine Morland	He had — she thought he had , once or twice before this fatal morning , shown something like affection for her .
Catherine Morland	But now — in short , she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour , went down when the clock struck five , with a broken heart , and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor ’s inquiry if she was well .
Catherine Morland	The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room , and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had never wanted comfort more , and he looked as if he was aware of it .
Catherine Morland	The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness ; and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity .
Catherine Morland	She did not learn either to forget or defend the past ; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther , and that it might not cost her Henry ’s entire regard .
Catherine Morland	Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done , nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary , self - created delusion , each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm , and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which , before she entered the abbey , had been craving to be frightened . She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of Northanger .
Catherine Morland	She saw that the infatuation had been created , the mischief settled , long before her quitting Bath , and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged .
Catherine Morland	Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country , and even of that , if hard pressed , would have yielded the northern and western extremities .
Catherine Morland	But in England it was not so ; among the English , she believed , in their hearts and habits , there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad .
Catherine Morland	Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable .
Catherine Morland	Her mind made up on these several points , and her resolution formed , of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense , she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever ; and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day .
Catherine Morland	Henry ’s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct , in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed , was of the greatest assistance to her ; and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress , her spirits became absolutely comfortable , and capable , as heretofore , of continual improvement by anything he said .
Catherine Morland	There were still some subjects , indeed , under which she believed they must always tremble — the mention of a chest or a cabinet , for instance — and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape : but even _ she _ could allow that an occasional memento of past folly , however painful , might not be without use .
Catherine Morland	Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater .
Catherine Morland	She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella ’s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James .
Catherine Morland	Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella .
Catherine Morland	James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton .
Catherine Morland	For nine successive mornings , Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment , which each morning became more severe : but , on the tenth , when she entered the breakfast - room , her first object was a letter , held out by Henry ’s willing hand .
Catherine Morland	She thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself .
Catherine Morland	“ ’ Tis only from James , however , ” as she looked at the direction .
Catherine Morland	She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : “ Dear Catherine , “ Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me .
Catherine Morland	I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again .
Catherine Morland	I shall not enter into particulars — they would only pain you more .
Catherine Morland	You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God !
Catherine Morland	i am undeceived in time !
Catherine Morland	after my father ’s consent had been so kindly given — but no more of this .
Catherine Morland	She has made me miserable forever !
Catherine Morland	let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; _ your _ love I do build upon .
Catherine Morland	I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced .
Catherine Morland	Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much .
Catherine Morland	I have written to him and my father .
Catherine Morland	Her duplicity hurts me more than all ; till the very last , if I reasoned with her , she declared herself as much attached to me as ever , and laughed at my fears .
Catherine Morland	I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it ; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved , I was that man .
Catherine Morland	I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney .
Catherine Morland	We parted at last by mutual consent — happy for me had we never met !
Catherine Morland	i can never expect to know such another woman !
Catherine Morland	Dearest Catherine , beware how you give your heart .
Catherine Morland	“ Believe me , ” & c. Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began .
Catherine Morland	They went to breakfast directly ; but Catherine could hardly eat anything .
Catherine Morland	Tears filled her eyes , and even ran down her cheeks as she sat .
Catherine Morland	The letter was one moment in her hand , then in her lap , and then in her pocket ; and she looked as if she knew not what she did .
Catherine Morland	The General , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible .
Catherine Morland	As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room ; but the housemaids were busy in it , and she was obliged to come down again .
Catherine Morland	She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her .
Catherine Morland	She drew back , trying to beg their pardon , but was , with gentle violence , forced to return ; and the others withdrew , after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her . After half an hour ’s free indulgence of grief and reflection , Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends ; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration .
Catherine Morland	Perhaps , if particularly questioned , she might just give an idea — just distantly hint at it — but not more .
Catherine Morland	To expose a friend , such a friend as Isabella had been to her — and then their own brother so closely concerned in it !
Catherine Morland	She believed she must waive the subject altogether .
Catherine Morland	Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast - room ; and each , as she entered it , looked at her anxiously .
Catherine Morland	Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , “ No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ?
Catherine Morland	Mr. and Mrs. Morland — your brothers and sisters — I hope they are none of them ill ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , I thank you ” ( sighing as she spoke ) ; “ they are all very well .
Catherine Morland	My letter was from my brother at Oxford . ”
Catherine Morland	Nothing further was said for a few minutes ; and then speaking through her tears , she added , “ I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , ” replied Henry warmly , “ must be a comfort to him under any distress . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I have one favour to beg , ” said Catherine , shortly afterwards , in an agitated manner , “ that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ”
Catherine Morland	“ How quick you are ! ” cried Catherine : “ you have guessed it , I declare !
Catherine Morland	Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours !
Catherine Morland	could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ” “ I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed .
Catherine Morland	I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland ’s disappointment .
Catherine Morland	I think you must be deceived so far .
Catherine Morland	I am very sorry for Mr. Morland — sorry that
Catherine Morland	you love should be unhappy
Catherine Morland	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer .
Catherine Morland	“ I do not know what I was thinking of ” ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; “ James only means to give me good advice . ”
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney , at Catherine ’s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe ’s connections and fortune .
Catherine Morland	“ Her mother is a very good sort of woman , ” was Catherine ’s answer .
Catherine Morland	I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family .
Catherine Morland	Your father is so very liberal !
Catherine Morland	He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children . ”
Catherine Morland	The brother and sister looked at each other .
Catherine Morland	When I think of his past declarations , I give him up .
Catherine Morland	Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe ’s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured .
Catherine Morland	Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . ” “ Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , ” said Eleanor with a smile .
Catherine Morland	“ But perhaps , ” observed Catherine , “ though she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours .
Catherine Morland	I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . ” “ You think it is all for ambition , then ?
Catherine Morland	“ Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . ”
Catherine Morland	“ My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it .
Catherine Morland	“ Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours .
Catherine Morland	You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy .
Catherine Morland	Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent .
Catherine Morland	You would not , for instance , now go to a ball for the world .
Catherine Morland	You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve , on whose regard you can place dependence , or whose counsel , in any difficulty , you could rely on .
Catherine Morland	You feel all this ?
Catherine Morland	” “ No , ” said Catherine , after a few moments ’ reflection , “ I do not — ought I ?
Catherine Morland	To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought
Catherine Morland	“ You feel , as you always do , what is most to the credit of human nature .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , by some chance or other , found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on , though so unaccountably , to mention the circumstance which had produced it .
Catherine Morland	19 A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely .
Catherine Morland	The result of her observations
Catherine Morland	When she saw her , indeed , surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar ’s Buildings or Pulteney Street , her change of manners was so trifling that , had it gone no farther , it might have passed unnoticed .
Catherine Morland	A something of languid indifference , or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before ,
Catherine Morland	But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over .
Catherine Morland	What could be meant by such unsteady conduct , what her friend could be at ,
Catherine Morland	was beyond her comprehension .
Catherine Morland	Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting ; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent .
Catherine Morland	She saw him grave and uneasy ; and however careless of his present comfort
Catherine Morland	For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned .
Catherine Morland	Though his looks did not please her , his name was a passport to her goodwill , and she thought with sincere compassion of
Catherine Morland	; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella ’s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it .
Catherine Morland	He might be jealous of her brother as a rival , but if more had seemed implied , the fault must have been in her misapprehension .
Catherine Morland	She wished , by a gentle remonstrance , to remind Isabella of her situation , and make her aware of this double unkindness ; but for remonstrance , either opportunity or comprehension was always against her .
Catherine Morland	became her chief consolation ; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days , and Captain Tilney ’s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own .
Catherine Morland	When Catherine knew this , her resolution was directly made .
Catherine Morland	She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement .
Catherine Morland	He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , “ Why do not you persuade him to go away ?
Catherine Morland	“ Then you will persuade him to go away ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him .
Catherine Morland	I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged .
Catherine Morland	“ No , he does not know what he is about , ” cried Catherine ; “ he does not know the pain he is giving my brother .
Catherine Morland	Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable .
Catherine Morland	“ And are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ” “ Yes , very sure . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Is it my brother ’s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe ’s admission of them , that gives the pain ? ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine blushed for her friend , and said , “ Isabella is wrong .
Catherine Morland	But I
Catherine Morland	am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother .
Catherine Morland	She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever .
Catherine Morland	You know she must be attached to him .
Catherine Morland	” “ I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ” “ Oh no , not flirts .
Catherine Morland	“ It is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly .
Catherine Morland	After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , “ Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ” “ I can have no opinion on that subject . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But what can your brother mean ?
Catherine Morland	“ You are a very close questioner . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Am I ?
Catherine Morland	I only ask what I want to be told . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ” “ My brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ”
Catherine Morland	The premises are before you .
Catherine Morland	My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week ’s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . ” “ Well , ” said Catherine , after some moments ’ consideration , “ _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother ’s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not .
Catherine Morland	But is not your father uncomfortable about it ?
Catherine Morland	Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go .
Catherine Morland	“ My dear Miss Morland , ” said Henry , “ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ?
Catherine Morland	I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can .
Catherine Morland	You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend
Catherine Morland	Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “ Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us .
Catherine Morland	Catherine would contend no longer against comfort .
Catherine Morland	She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech , but it now carried her captive .
Catherine Morland	She blamed herself for the extent of her fears , and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again .
Catherine Morland	Her resolution was supported by Isabella ’s behaviour in their parting interview .
Catherine Morland	The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine ’s stay in Pulteney Street , and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness , or make her quit them in apprehension .
Catherine Morland	Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart ; but that at such a moment was allowable ; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction , and once she drew back her hand ; but Catherine remembered Henry ’s instructions , and placed it all to judicious affection .
Catherine Morland	I hope this pleases you ” ( turning her back on him ) ; “ I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine heard all this , and quite out of countenance , could listen no longer .
Catherine Morland	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney .
Catherine Morland	With much uneasiness did she thus leave them .
Catherine Morland	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement .
Catherine Morland	She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self , and not so much about money , and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney .
Catherine Morland	She was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere ; for she had not forgotten that he could mistake , and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was too wretched to be fearful .
Catherine Morland	The journey in itself had no terrors for her ; and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness .
Catherine Morland	Leaning back in one corner of the carriage , in a violent burst of tears , she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head ; and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it .
Catherine Morland	Unfortunately , the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from Woodston ; and , for fourteen miles , every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different .
Catherine Morland	Every mile , as it brought her nearer Woodston , added to her sufferings , and when within the distance of five , she passed the turning which led to it , and thought of Henry , so near , yet so unconscious , her grief and agitation were excessive .
Catherine Morland	The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life .
Catherine Morland	It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage .
Catherine Morland	Yes , only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard — had he even confused her by his too significant reference ! and now — what had she done , or what had she omitted to do , to merit such a change ?
Catherine Morland	The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge .
Catherine Morland	Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained ; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each .
Catherine Morland	Designedly , at least , Henry could not have betrayed her .
Catherine Morland	If , indeed , by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for , of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations , she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation .
Catherine Morland	If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer , she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house .
Catherine Morland	But a justification so full of torture to herself , she trusted , would not be in his power .
Catherine Morland	Anxious as were all her conjectures on this point , it was not , however , the one on which she dwelt most .
Catherine Morland	In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries , on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose , the hours passed away , and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for .
Catherine Morland	The pressing anxieties of thought , which prevented her from noticing anything before her , when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston , saved her at the same time from watching her progress ; and though no object on the road could engage a moment ’s attention , she found no stage of it tedious .
Catherine Morland	From this , she was preserved too by another cause , by feeling no eagerness for her journey ’s conclusion ; for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best , even after an absence such as hers — an eleven weeks ’ absence .
Catherine Morland	What had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family , that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it , extend an useless resentment , and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will ?
Catherine Morland	She
Catherine Morland	could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor ’s merit ; she felt it too strongly for expression ; and should a dislike be taken against them , should they be thought of unfavourably , on their father ’s account , it would cut her to the heart .
Catherine Morland	With these feelings , she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well - known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home .
Catherine Morland	Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger ; but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post - masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it ; so great had been her ignorance of her route .
Catherine Morland	She met with nothing , however , to distress or frighten her .
Catherine Morland	Her youth , civil manners , and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require ; and stopping only to change horses , she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm , and between six and seven o’clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton .
Catherine Morland	A heroine returning , at the close of her career , to her native village , in all the triumph of recovered reputation , and all the dignity of a countess , with a long train of noble relations in their several phaetons , and three waiting - maids in a travelling chaise and four , behind her , is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well delight to dwell ; it gives credit to every conclusion , and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestows .
Catherine Morland	Swiftly therefore shall her post - boy drive through the village , amid the gaze of Sunday groups , and speedy shall be her descent from it .
Catherine Morland	But , whatever might be the distress of Catherine ’s mind , as she thus advanced towards the parsonage , and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it , she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went ; first , in the appearance of her carriage — and secondly , in herself .
Catherine Morland	Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine !
Catherine Morland	but whether such happiness were the lawful property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood .
Catherine Morland	Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine ’s heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible .
Catherine Morland	So surrounded , so caressed , she was even happy !
Catherine Morland	Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that “ it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , ” grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour .
Catherine Morland	“ My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , ” said her mother at last ; “ depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , ” said Sarah , “ but why not do it civilly ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am sorry for the young people , ” returned Mrs. Morland ; “ they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General
Catherine Morland	Catherine sighed .
Catherine Morland	“ Well , ” continued her philosophic mother , “ I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done .
Catherine Morland	It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets .
Catherine Morland	Catherine hoped so too , and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment , but her spirits were quite worn down ; and , to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish , she readily agreed to her mother ’s next counsel of going early to bed .
Catherine Morland	Her parents , seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified
Catherine Morland	parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away ; and though , when they all met the next morning , her recovery was not equal to their hopes , they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil .
Catherine Morland	They never once thought of her heart , which , for the parents of a young lady of seventeen , just returned from her first excursion from home , was odd enough !
Catherine Morland	As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend ’s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure .
Catherine Morland	The strength of these feelings , however , was far from assisting her pen ; and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor Tilney .
Catherine Morland	To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation , convey gratitude without servile regret , be guarded without coldness , and honest without resentment — a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of — and , above all , which she might not blush herself , if Henry should chance to see , was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance ; and , after long thought and much perplexity , to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety .
Catherine Morland	I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella .
Catherine Morland	well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine coloured as she warmly answered , “ No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . ”
Catherine Morland	“ If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy .
Catherine Morland	It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in
Catherine Morland	The hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into Catherine ’s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her .
Catherine Morland	She could never forget Henry Tilney , or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment ; but he might forget her ; and in that case , to meet — !
Catherine Morland	her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment .
Catherine Morland	” This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could listen to ; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance , and made her reply less rational ; for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well - known road .
Catherine Morland	It was not three months ago since , wild with joyful expectation , she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day , with an heart light , gay , and independent ; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed , and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it .
Catherine Morland	Three months ago had seen her all this ; and now , how altered a being did she return !
Catherine Morland	She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked - for appearance , acting on a steady affection , would naturally call forth ; and great was their surprise , and warm their displeasure , on hearing how she had been treated — though Mrs. Morland ’s account of it was no inflated representation , no studied appeal to their passions .
Catherine Morland	“ Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , ” said she .
Catherine Morland	“ She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house .
Catherine Morland	Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again !
Catherine Morland	and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ” Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself .
Catherine Morland	A more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition ; and , after completing the fourth , she immediately added , “ Only think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was .
Catherine Morland	I must show it you some day or other .
Catherine Morland	Bath is a nice place , Catherine , after all .
Catherine Morland	I assure you I did not above half like coming away .
Catherine Morland	You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , but _ that _ did not last long , ” said Catherine , her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there .
Catherine Morland	My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ?
Catherine Morland	I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since .
Catherine Morland	Do you remember that evening ? ” “ Do I ! oh ! perfectly . ” “ It was very agreeable , was not it ?
Catherine Morland	I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure .
Catherine Morland	Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I really have not patience with the General !
Catherine Morland	His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them , Catherine .
Catherine Morland	But no wonder ; Milsom Street , you know .
Catherine Morland	As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter ’s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends .
Catherine Morland	There was a great deal of good sense in all this ; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power ; and Catherine ’s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced .
Catherine Morland	It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford .
Catherine Morland	That room , in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival , was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers .
Catherine Morland	Yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then
Catherine Morland	her anxiety had foundation in fact , her fears in probability ; and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil , the solitude of her situation , the darkness of her chamber , the antiquity of the building , were felt and considered without the smallest emotion ; and though the wind was high , and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house , she heard it all as she lay awake , hour after hour , without curiosity or terror .
Catherine Morland	Soon after six Eleanor entered her room , eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible ; but very little remained to be done .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared .
Catherine Morland	And she only wanted to know how far , after what had passed , an apology might properly be received by her .
Catherine Morland	Very little passed between them on meeting ; each found her greatest safety in silence , and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs , Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress , and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk .
Catherine Morland	When everything was done they left the room , Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well - known , cherished object , and went down to the breakfast - parlour , where breakfast was prepared .
Catherine Morland	She tried to eat , as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable ; but she had no appetite , and could not swallow many mouthfuls .
Catherine Morland	The contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery , and strengthened her distaste for everything before her .
Catherine Morland	with what cheerful ease , what happy , though false , security , had she then looked around her , enjoying everything present , and fearing little in future , beyond Henry ’s going to Woodston for a day !
Catherine Morland	for Henry had been there ; Henry had sat by her and helped her .
Catherine Morland	These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion , who sat as deep in thought as herself ; and the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the present moment .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s colour rose at the sight of it ; and the indignity with which she was treated , striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force , made her for a short time sensible only of resentment .
Catherine Morland	“ You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , ” she cried ; “ you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible .
Catherine Morland	Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour ’s comfort .
Catherine Morland	Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more .
Catherine Morland	“ No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write .
Catherine Morland	There can be no doubt of my getting home safe . ”
Catherine Morland	Eleanor only replied , “ I can not wonder at your feelings .
Catherine Morland	I will not importune you .
Catherine Morland	I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . ”
Catherine Morland	But this , with the look of sorrow accompanying it , was enough to melt Catherine ’s pride in a moment , and she instantly said , “ Oh , Eleanor , I _ will _ write to you indeed .
Catherine Morland	It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home , Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey , and , upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation , it proved to be exactly the case .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment , but , upon examining her purse , was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend , she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home ; and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both , scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together .
Catherine Morland	The carriage was soon announced to be ready ; and Catherine , instantly rising , a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu ; and , as they entered the hall , unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either
Catherine Morland	, she paused a moment , and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left “ her kind remembrance for her absent friend . ”
Catherine Morland	But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings ; and , hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief , she darted across the hall , jumped into the chaise , and in a moment was driven from the door .
Catherine Morland	22 The housemaid ’s folding back her window - shutters at eight o’clock the next day was the sound which first roused Catherine ; and she opened her eyes , wondering that they could ever have been closed , on objects of cheerfulness ; her fire was already burning , and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night .
Catherine Morland	, with the consciousness of existence , returned her recollection of the manuscript ; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid ’s going away
Catherine Morland	, she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground , and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow .
Catherine Morland	She now plainly saw that she must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had shuddered over in books , for the roll , seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets , was altogether but of trifling size , and much less than she had supposed it to be at first .
Catherine Morland	Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page .
Catherine Morland	She started at its import .
Catherine Morland	Could it be possible , or did not her senses play her false ?
Catherine Morland	An inventory of linen , in coarse and modern characters , seemed all that was before her !
Catherine Morland	if the evidence of sight might be trusted , she held a washing - bill in her hand .
Catherine Morland	She seized another sheet , and saw the same articles with little variation ; a third , a fourth , and a fifth presented nothing new .
Catherine Morland	Shirts , stockings , cravats , and waistcoats faced her in each .
Catherine Morland	such was the collection of papers ( left perhaps , as she could then suppose , by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them ) which had filled her with expectation and alarm , and robbed her of half her night ’s rest !
Catherine Morland	she felt humbled to the dust .
Catherine Morland	Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom ?
Catherine Morland	A corner of it , catching her eye as she lay , seemed to rise up in judgment against her .
Catherine Morland	Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies .
Catherine Morland	To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that , so modern , so habitable!—Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet , the key of which was open to all
Catherine Morland	How could she have so imposed on herself ?
Catherine Morland	Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly !
Catherine Morland	and it was in a great measure his own doing , for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures , she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it .
Catherine Morland	Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly , those detestable papers then scattered over the bed , she rose directly ,
Catherine Morland	and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before , returned them to the same spot within the cabinet , with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again , to disgrace her even with herself .
Catherine Morland	Why the locks should have been so difficult to open , however , was still something remarkable , for she could now manage them with perfect ease .
Catherine Morland	In this there was surely something mysterious , and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute , till the possibility of the door ’s having been at first unlocked , and of being herself its fastener , darted into her head , and cost her another blush .
Catherine Morland	She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections , and found her way with all speed to the breakfast - parlour , as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before .
Catherine Morland	hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest , with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited , was rather distressing .
Catherine Morland	For the world would she not have her weakness suspected , and yet , unequal to an absolute falsehood , was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little .
Catherine Morland	“ But we have a charming morning after it , ” she added , desiring to get rid of the subject ; “ and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over .
Catherine Morland	i have just learnt to love a hyacinth . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And how might you learn ?
Catherine Morland	“ Your sister taught me ; I can not tell how .
Catherine Morland	Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . ” “ But now you love a hyacinth .
Catherine Morland	You have gained a new source of enjoyment , and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible .
Catherine Morland	And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic , who can tell , the sentiment once raised , but you may in time come to love a rose ?
Catherine Morland	“ But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors .
Catherine Morland	The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me , and in fine weather I am out more than half my time .
Catherine Morland	Mamma says I am never within . ”
Catherine Morland	“ At any rate , however , I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the General , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind , but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure .
Catherine Morland	The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine ’s notice when they were seated at table ; and , luckily , it had been the General ’s choice .
Catherine Morland	He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste , confessed it to be neat and simple , thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country ; and for his part , to his uncritical palate , the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire , as from that of Dresden or Sêve .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him .
Catherine Morland	They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse , and immediately on re - entering the breakfast - room , Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure .
Catherine Morland	“ This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother ’s fortitude , ” observed the General to Eleanor .
Catherine Morland	“ Is it a pretty place ? ” asked Catherine .
Catherine Morland	“ What say you , Eleanor ?
Catherine Morland	Speak your opinion , for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men .
Catherine Morland	It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one .
Catherine Morland	Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession .
Catherine Morland	The silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable .
Catherine Morland	Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house , and he now offered himself as her conductor ; and
Catherine Morland	though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter , it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself , under any circumstances , not to be gladly accepted ; for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey , and had seen only a few of its rooms .
Catherine Morland	The netting - box , just leisurely drawn forth , was closed with joyful haste , and she was ready to attend him in a moment . “ And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . ”
Catherine Morland	She curtsied her acquiescence .
Catherine Morland	“ But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object .
Catherine Morland	Which would she prefer ?
Catherine Morland	He was equally at her service .
Catherine Morland	Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend ’s wishes ?
Catherine Morland	Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland ’s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather .
Catherine Morland	But when did she judge amiss ?
Catherine Morland	He left the room , and Catherine , with a disappointed , anxious face , began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination , under a mistaken idea of pleasing her ; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney ’s saying , with a little confusion , “ I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father ’s account ; he always walks out at this time of day .
Catherine Morland	Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood .
Catherine Morland	Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed ?
Catherine Morland	Could there be any unwillingness on the General ’s side to show her over the abbey ?
Catherine Morland	Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so .
Catherine Morland	She was all impatience to see the house , and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds .
Catherine Morland	But now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it .
Catherine Morland	Such were her thoughts , but she kept them to herself , and put on her bonnet in patient discontent .
Catherine Morland	She was struck , however , beyond her expectation , by the grandeur of the abbey , as she saw it for the first time from the lawn .
Catherine Morland	Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it ; and her feelings of delight were so strong , that without waiting for any better authority , she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise .
Catherine Morland	The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay , being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen ’s , as well as her father ’s , including church - yard and orchard .
Catherine Morland	The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , “ without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom .
Catherine Morland	Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired .
Catherine Morland	“ But where are you going , Eleanor ?
Catherine Morland	Why do you choose that cold , damp path to it ?
Catherine Morland	Miss Morland will get wet .
Catherine Morland	“ This is so favourite a walk of mine , ” said Miss Tilney , “ that I always think it the best and nearest way .
Catherine Morland	It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the General ’s disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward .
Catherine Morland	He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition .
Catherine Morland	He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . “ I am particularly fond of this spot , ” said her companion , with a sigh .
Catherine Morland	“ It was my mother ’s favourite walk . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before , and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance , and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more .
Catherine Morland	“ I used to walk here so often with her ! ” added Eleanor ; “ though I never loved it then , as I have loved it since .
Catherine Morland	At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice .
Catherine Morland	“ And ought it not , ” reflected Catherine , “ to endear it to her husband ?
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney continuing silent , she ventured to say , “ Her death must have been a great affliction ! ”
Catherine Morland	, ” replied the other , in a low voice .
Catherine Morland	“ I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . ”
Catherine Morland	She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ”
Catherine Morland	“ To be sure you must miss him very much . ”
Catherine Morland	Was it from dejection of spirits?”—were questions now eagerly poured forth ; the first three received a ready affirmative , the two others were passed by ; and Catherine ’s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question , whether answered or not .
Catherine Morland	Of her unhappiness in marriage , she felt persuaded .
Catherine Morland	And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . “ Her picture , I suppose , ” blushing at the consummate art of her own question , “ hangs in your father ’s room ? ” “ No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place .
Catherine Morland	Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ” Here was another proof .
Catherine Morland	Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which , in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited ; and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion .
Catherine Morland	his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her .
Catherine Morland	She had often read of such characters , characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn ; but here was proof positive of the contrary .
Catherine Morland	She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the General ; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation , she found herself again obliged to walk with him , listen to him , and even to smile when he smiled .
Catherine Morland	, she soon
Catherine Morland	began to walk with lassitude ; the General perceived it , and with a concern for her health , which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him , was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house .
Catherine Morland	Again they parted — but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return .
Catherine Morland	This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable .
Catherine Morland	11 The morrow brought a very sober - looking morning , the sun making only a few efforts to appear , and Catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes .
Catherine Morland	A bright morning so early in the year , she allowed , would generally turn to rain , but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced .
Catherine Morland	She applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of her hopes , but Mr. Allen , not having his own skies and barometer about him , declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine .
Catherine Morland	She applied to Mrs. Allen , and Mrs. Allen ’s opinion was more positive .
Catherine Morland	“ She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day , if the clouds would only go off , and the sun keep out . ”
Catherine Morland	At about eleven o’clock , however , a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine ’s watchful eye , and “ Oh ! dear , I do believe it will be wet , ” broke from her in a most desponding tone . “ I thought how it would be , ” said Mrs. Allen . “ No walk for me to - day , ” sighed Catherine ; “ but perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Perhaps it may , but then , my dear , it will be so dirty . ”
Catherine Morland	that will not signify ; I never mind dirt . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , ” replied her friend very placidly , “ I know you never mind dirt . ” After a short pause , “ It comes on faster and faster ! ” said Catherine , as she stood watching at a window .
Catherine Morland	How I hate the sight of an umbrella ! ”
Catherine Morland	I would much rather take a chair at any time . ” “ It was such a nice - looking morning !
Catherine Morland	i felt so convinced it would be dry ! ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine went every five minutes to the clock , threatening on each return that , if it still kept on raining another five minutes , she would give up the matter as hopeless .
Catherine Morland	“ You will not be able to go , my dear . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I do not quite despair yet .
Catherine Morland	I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve .
Catherine Morland	This is just the time of day for it to clear up , and I do think it looks a little lighter .
Catherine Morland	There , it is twenty minutes after twelve , and now I _ shall _ give it up entirely .
Catherine Morland	At half past twelve , when Catherine ’s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment , the sky began voluntarily to clear .
Catherine Morland	A gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise ; she looked round ; the clouds were parting , and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance .
Catherine Morland	But whether Catherine might still expect her friends , whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture , must yet be a question .
Catherine Morland	It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump - room ; he accordingly set off by himself , and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages , containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back .
Catherine Morland	“ Isabella , my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare !
Catherine Morland	they are coming for me perhaps — but I shall not go — I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . ”
Catherine Morland	“ My sweetest Catherine , is not this delightful ?
Catherine Morland	You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme ; it darted into our heads at breakfast - time , I verily believe at the same instant ; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for
Catherine Morland	; but here is your sister says she will not go . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Blaize Castle ! ” cried Catherine .
Catherine Morland	“ Then I should like to see it ; but I cannot — I can not go .
Catherine Morland	my beloved creature , what do you mean ? ”
Catherine Morland	You could no more walk than you could fly !
Catherine Morland	Isabella corroborated it : “ My dearest Catherine , you can not form an idea of the dirt ; come , you must go ; you can not refuse going now . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I should like to see the castle ; but may we go all over it ?
Catherine Morland	“ But then , if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer , and call by and by ? ” “ Make yourself easy , there is no danger of that , for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback , that they were going as far as Wick Rocks . ” “ Then I will .
Catherine Morland	Shall I go , Mrs. Allen ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Just as you please , my dear .
Catherine Morland	“ Mrs. Allen , you must persuade her to go , ” was the general cry .
Catherine Morland	Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it : “ Well , my dear , ” said she , “ suppose you go . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s feelings , as she got into the carriage , were in a very unsettled state ; divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure , and the hope of soon enjoying another , almost its equal in degree , however unlike in kind .
Catherine Morland	She could not think the Tilneys had acted quite well by her , in so readily giving up their engagement , without sending her any message of excuse .
Catherine Morland	It was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk ; and , in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour , she could not from her own observation help thinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience .
Catherine Morland	To feel herself slighted by them was very painful .
Catherine Morland	On the other hand , the delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho , as her fancy represented Blaize Castle to be ,
Catherine Morland	was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost anything .
Catherine Morland	Thorpe talked to his horse , and she meditated , by turns , on broken promises and broken arches , phaetons and false hangings , Tilneys and trap - doors .
Catherine Morland	As they entered Argyle Buildings , however , she was roused by this address from her companion , “ Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by ? ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother ’s arm , walking slowly down the street .
Catherine Morland	She saw them both looking back at her .
Catherine Morland	“ Stop , stop , Mr. Thorpe , ” she impatiently cried ; “ it is Miss Tilney ; it is indeed .
Catherine Morland	How could you tell me they were gone ?
Catherine Morland	Stop , stop , I will get out this moment and go to them . ”
Catherine Morland	But to what purpose did she speak ?
Catherine Morland	Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot ; the Tilneys , who had soon ceased to look after her , were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place , and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace .
Catherine Morland	, she entreated him to stop .
Catherine Morland	I can not go on .
Catherine Morland	I will not go on .
Catherine Morland	I must go back to Miss Tilney . ”
Catherine Morland	But Mr. Thorpe only laughed , smacked his whip , encouraged his horse , made odd noises , and drove on ; and Catherine , angry and vexed as she was , having no power of getting away , was obliged to give up the point and submit .
Catherine Morland	Her reproaches , however , were not spared .
Catherine Morland	“ How could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ?
Catherine Morland	I would not have had it happen so for the world .
Catherine Morland	They must think it so strange , so rude of me !
Catherine Morland	you do not know how vexed I am ; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton , nor in anything else .
Catherine Morland	I had rather , ten thousand times rather , get out now , and walk back to them .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing .
Catherine Morland	She listened reluctantly , and her replies were short .
Catherine Morland	Blaize Castle remained her only comfort ; towards _ that _ , she still looked at intervals with pleasure ; though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk , and especially rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys , she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its walls could supply — the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms , exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture , though now for many years deserted — the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow , winding vaults , by a low , grated door ; or even of having their lamp , their only lamp , extinguished by a sudden gust of wind , and of being left in total darkness .
Catherine Morland	The others then came close enough for conversation , and Morland said , “ We had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on to - day ; your sister thinks so as well as I.
Catherine Morland	“ If your brother had not got such a d — — beast to drive , ” said he soon afterwards , “ we might have done it very well .
Catherine Morland	My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour , if left to himself , and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken - winded jade ’s pace .
Catherine Morland	“ No , he is not , ” said Catherine warmly , “ for I am sure he could not afford it . ”
Catherine Morland	Thorpe then said something in the loud , incoherent way to which he had often recourse , about its being a d — — thing to be miserly ; and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things , he did not know who could , which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand .
Catherine Morland	Disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment , she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so ; and they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words . As she entered the house , the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off ; that , when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe , the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her ; and on his saying no , had felt for a card , but said she had none about her , and went away .
Catherine Morland	Pondering over these heart - rending tidings , Catherine walked slowly upstairs .
Catherine Morland	At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , “ I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back .
Catherine Morland	Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits ; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce , in the fate of which she shared , by private partnership with Morland , a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton .
Catherine Morland	Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows , so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind , and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered .
Catherine Morland	“ You will quite break my heart .
Catherine Morland	what a delightful hand you have got !
Catherine Morland	i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself .
Catherine Morland	” And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch , which is the true heroine ’s portion ; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears .
Catherine Morland	This was readily agreed to , with only a proviso of Miss Tilney ’s , that it did not rain , which Catherine was sure it would not .
Catherine Morland	At twelve o’clock , they were to call for her in Pulteney Street ; and “ Remember — twelve o’clock
Catherine Morland	, ” was her parting speech to her new friend .
Catherine Morland	Of her other , her older , her more established friend , Isabella , of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight ’s experience , she scarcely saw anything during the evening .
Catherine Morland	Yet , though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness , she cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen , which took them rather early away , and her spirits danced within her , as she danced in her chair all the way home .
Catherine Morland	With a mind thus full of happiness , Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away , without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together .
Catherine Morland	She began first to be sensible of this , and to sigh for her conversation , as she walked along the pump - room one morning , by Mrs. Allen ’s side , without anything to say or to hear ; and scarcely had she felt a five minutes ’ longing of friendship , before the object of it appeared , and inviting her to a secret conference , led the way to a seat . “ This is my favourite place , ” said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors , which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either ; “ it is so out of the way . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine , observing that Isabella ’s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other , as in eager expectation , and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch , thought the present a fine opportunity for being really so ; and therefore gaily said , “ Do not be uneasy , Isabella , James will soon be here .
Catherine Morland	my dear creature , ” she replied , “ do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow .
Catherine Morland	It would be hideous to be always together ; we should be the jest of the place . And so you are going to Northanger !
Catherine Morland	i am amazingly glad of it .
Catherine Morland	It is one of the finest old places in England , I understand .
Catherine Morland	I shall depend upon a most particular description of it .
Catherine Morland	” “ You shall certainly have the best in my power to give .
Catherine Morland	But who are you looking for ?
Catherine Morland	Are your sisters coming ? ” “ I am not looking for anybody .
Catherine Morland	One ’s eyes must be somewhere , and you know what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine , when my thoughts are an hundred miles off .
Catherine Morland	I am amazingly absent ; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world .
Catherine Morland	“ But I thought , Isabella , you had something in particular to tell me ? ” “ Oh yes , and so I have .
Catherine Morland	But here is a proof of what I was saying .
Catherine Morland	My poor head , I had quite forgot it .
Catherine Morland	Well , the thing is this : I have just had a letter from John ; you can guess the contents .
Catherine Morland	“ No , indeed , I can not . ”
Catherine Morland	“ My sweet love , do not be so abominably affected .
Catherine Morland	What can he write about , but yourself ?
Catherine Morland	You know he is over head and ears in love with you . ”
Catherine Morland	“ With _ me _ , dear Isabella ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Nay , my sweetest Catherine , this is being quite absurd !
Catherine Morland	I have no idea of being so overstrained !
Catherine Morland	And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement .
Catherine Morland	He says so in this letter , says that he as good as made you an offer , and that you received his advances in the kindest way ; and now he wants me to urge his suit , and say all manner of pretty things to you .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , with all the earnestness of truth , expressed her astonishment at such a charge , protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe ’s being in love with her , and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him .
Catherine Morland	, I do declare , upon my honour , I never was sensible of them for a moment — except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming .
Catherine Morland	And as to making me an offer , or anything like it , there must be some unaccountable mistake .
Catherine Morland	I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind , you know !
Catherine Morland	and , as I ever wish to be believed , I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us .
Catherine Morland	it must be all and completely a mistake — for I did not see him once that whole morning . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar ’s Buildings — it was the day your father ’s consent came — and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . ”
Catherine Morland	Well , if you say it , it was so , I dare say — but for the life of me , I can not recollect it .
Catherine Morland	I _ do _ remember now being with you , and seeing him as well as the rest — but that we were ever alone for five minutes —
Catherine Morland	However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him .
Catherine Morland	I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me — but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side ; I never had the smallest idea of it .
Catherine Morland	Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I ought to say — but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way .
Catherine Morland	I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours , Isabella , I am sure ; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another—_he _ is not the person . ”
Catherine Morland	“ My dear friend , you must not be angry with me .
Catherine Morland	I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me .
Catherine Morland	But where am I wandering to ?
Catherine Morland	Well , my dear Catherine , the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John — is not it so ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . ” “ Since that is the case , I am sure I shall not tease you any further .
Catherine Morland	John desired me to speak to you on the subject , and therefore I have .
Catherine Morland	But I confess , as soon as I read his letter , I thought it a very foolish , imprudent business , and not likely to promote the good of either ; for what were you to live upon , supposing you came together ?
Catherine Morland	You have both of you something , to be sure , but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays ; and after all that romancers may say
Catherine Morland	I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . ” “ You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ” “ Oh !
Catherine Morland	as to that , ” answered Isabella laughingly , “ I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been .
Catherine Morland	All that is best known to yourself .
Catherine Morland	But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely .
Catherine Morland	What one means one day , you know , one may not mean the next .
Catherine Morland	“ But my opinion of your brother never did alter ; it was always the same .
Catherine Morland	“ My dearest Catherine , ” continued the other without at all listening to her , “ I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about .
Catherine Morland	I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother , because he is my brother , and who perhaps after all , you know , might be just as happy without you , for people seldom know what they would be at , young men especially , they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant .
Catherine Morland	What I say is , why should a brother ’s happiness be dearer to me than a friend ’s ?
Catherine Morland	You know I carry my notions of friendship pretty high .
Catherine Morland	But , above all things , my dear Catherine , do not be in a hurry .
Catherine Morland	Take my word for it , that if you are in too great a hurry , you will certainly live to repent it .
Catherine Morland	Tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections , and I believe he is very right .
Catherine Morland	here he comes ; never mind , he will not see us , I am sure .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , looking up , perceived Captain Tilney ; and Isabella , earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke , soon caught his notice .
Catherine Morland	He approached immediately , and took the seat to which her movements invited him .
Catherine Morland	His first address made Catherine start .
Catherine Morland	Though spoken low , she could distinguish , “ What ! always to be watched , in person or by proxy ! ” “ Psha , nonsense ! ” was Isabella ’s answer in the same half whisper .
Catherine Morland	I hope this pleases you ” ( turning her back on him ) ; “ I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine heard all this , and quite out of countenance , could listen no longer .
Catherine Morland	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney .
Catherine Morland	With much uneasiness did she thus leave them .
Catherine Morland	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement .
Catherine Morland	She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self , and not so much about money , and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney .
Catherine Morland	She was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere ; for she had not forgotten that he could mistake , and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious .
Catherine Morland	Isabella talked of his attentions ; _ she _ had never been sensible of any ; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste , and
Catherine Morland	19 A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely .
Catherine Morland	The result of her observations
Catherine Morland	When she saw her , indeed , surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar ’s Buildings or Pulteney Street , her change of manners was so trifling that , had it gone no farther , it might have passed unnoticed .
Catherine Morland	A something of languid indifference , or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before ,
Catherine Morland	But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over .
Catherine Morland	What could be meant by such unsteady conduct , what her friend could be at ,
Catherine Morland	was beyond her comprehension .
Catherine Morland	Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting ; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent .
Catherine Morland	She saw him grave and uneasy ; and however careless of his present comfort
Catherine Morland	the woman might be who had given him her heart , to _ her _ it was always an object .
Catherine Morland	For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned .
Catherine Morland	Though his looks did not please her , his name was a passport to her goodwill , and she thought with sincere compassion of
Catherine Morland	; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella ’s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it .
Catherine Morland	He might be jealous of her brother as a rival , but if more had seemed implied , the fault must have been in her misapprehension .
Catherine Morland	She wished , by a gentle remonstrance , to remind Isabella of her situation , and make her aware of this double unkindness ; but for remonstrance , either opportunity or comprehension was always against her .
Catherine Morland	became her chief consolation ; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days , and Captain Tilney ’s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own .
Catherine Morland	When Catherine knew this , her resolution was directly made .
Catherine Morland	She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement .
Catherine Morland	He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , “ Why do not you persuade him to go away ?
Catherine Morland	“ No , he does not know what he is about , ” cried Catherine ; “ he does not know the pain he is giving my brother .
Catherine Morland	Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable .
Catherine Morland	“ And are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ” “ Yes , very sure . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Is it my brother ’s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe ’s admission of them , that gives the pain ? ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine blushed for her friend , and said , “ Isabella is wrong .
Catherine Morland	But I
Catherine Morland	am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother .
Catherine Morland	She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever .
Catherine Morland	” “ I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ” “ Oh no , not flirts .
Catherine Morland	After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , “ Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ” “ I can have no opinion on that subject . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But what can your brother mean ?
Catherine Morland	“ You are a very close questioner . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Am I ?
Catherine Morland	I only ask what I want to be told . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ” “ My brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ”
Catherine Morland	The premises are before you .
Catherine Morland	My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week ’s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . ” “ Well , ” said Catherine , after some moments ’ consideration , “ _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother ’s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not .
Catherine Morland	But is not your father uncomfortable about it ?
Catherine Morland	Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go .
Catherine Morland	“ My dear Miss Morland , ” said Henry , “ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ?
Catherine Morland	Are you not carried a little too far ?
Catherine Morland	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ?
Catherine Morland	He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it .
Catherine Morland	I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can .
Catherine Morland	You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend
Catherine Morland	Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “ Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us .
Catherine Morland	The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine would contend no longer against comfort .
Catherine Morland	She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech , but it now carried her captive .
Catherine Morland	She blamed herself for the extent of her fears , and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again .
Catherine Morland	Her resolution was supported by Isabella ’s behaviour in their parting interview .
Catherine Morland	The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine ’s stay in Pulteney Street , and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness , or make her quit them in apprehension .
Catherine Morland	Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart ; but that at such a moment was allowable ; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction , and once she drew back her hand ; but Catherine remembered Henry ’s instructions , and placed it all to judicious affection .
Catherine Morland	9 The progress of Catherine ’s unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows .
Catherine Morland	It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her , while she remained in the rooms , which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home .
Catherine Morland	This , on arriving in Pulteney Street , took the direction of extraordinary hunger , and when that was appeased , changed into an earnest longing to be in bed ; such was the extreme point of her distress ; for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours , and from which she awoke perfectly revived , in excellent spirits , with fresh hopes and fresh schemes .
Catherine Morland	The first wish of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney , and almost her first resolution , to seek her for that purpose , in the pump - room at noon .
Catherine Morland	that building she had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence , and the completion of female intimacy , so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited confidence , that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls .
Catherine Morland	Her plan for the morning thus settled , she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast , resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one ; and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen , whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such , that as she never talked a great deal , so she could never be entirely silent ; and , therefore , while she sat at her work , if she lost her needle or broke her thread , if she heard a carriage in the street , or saw a speck upon her gown , she must observe it aloud , whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not .
Catherine Morland	At about half past twelve , a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window , and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door , in the first only a servant , her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second , before John Thorpe came running upstairs , calling out , “ Well , Miss Morland , here I am .
Catherine Morland	Have you been waiting long ?
Catherine Morland	Come , Miss Morland , be quick , for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off .
Catherine Morland	“ What do you mean ? ” said Catherine .
Catherine Morland	Why , you have not forgot our engagement !
Catherine Morland	What a head you have !
Catherine Morland	“ Something was said about it , I remember , ” said Catherine , looking at Mrs. Allen for her opinion ; “ but really I did not expect you .
Catherine Morland	and what a dust you would have made , if I had not come . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer .
Catherine Morland	Can you spare me for an hour or two ?
Catherine Morland	Shall I go ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Do just as you please , my dear , ” replied Mrs. Allen , with the most placid indifference .
Catherine Morland	Catherine took the advice , and ran off to get ready .
Catherine Morland	In a very few minutes she reappeared , having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise , after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen ’s admiration of his gig ; and then receiving her friend ’s parting good wishes , they both hurried downstairs .
Catherine Morland	“ My dearest creature , ” cried Isabella , to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage , “ you have been at least three hours getting ready .
Catherine Morland	I was afraid you were ill .
Catherine Morland	I have a thousand things to say to you ; but make haste and get in , for I long to be off . ” Catherine followed her orders and turned away , but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to James , “ What a sweet girl she is !
Catherine Morland	“ You will not be frightened , Miss Morland , ” said Thorpe , as he handed her in , “ if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off .
Catherine Morland	Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one , but it was too late to retreat , and she was too young to own herself frightened ; so , resigning herself to her fate , and trusting to the animal ’s boasted knowledge of its owner , she sat peaceably down , and saw Thorpe sit down by her .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , delighted at so happy an escape , spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise ; and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins , and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse , he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks , congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman ; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner , without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity , and ( considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour ) by no means alarmingly fast , gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind , in a fine mild day of February , with the consciousness of safety .
Catherine Morland	Catherine did not understand him — and he repeated his question , adding in explanation , “ Old Allen , the man you are with . ”
Catherine Morland	Yes , I believe , he is very rich . ”
Catherine Morland	He is _ your _ godfather , is not he ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ My godfather !
Catherine Morland	“ But you are always very much with them . ” “ Yes , very much . ”
Catherine Morland	He is a very temperate man , and you could not fancy him in liquor last night ? ” “ Lord help you !
Catherine Morland	“ I can not believe it . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford . ” “ Oxford ! there is no drinking at Oxford now , I assure you .
Catherine Morland	But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there . ” “ Yes , it does give a notion , ” said Catherine warmly , “ and that is , that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did .
Catherine Morland	However , I am sure James does not drink so much .
Catherine Morland	This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply , of which no part was very distinct , except the frequent exclamations , amounting almost to oaths , which adorned it , and Catherine was left , when it ended , with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford , and the same happy conviction of her brother ’s comparative sobriety .
Catherine Morland	Thorpe ’s ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage , and she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse moved along , and the ease which his paces , as well as the excellence of the springs , gave the motion of the carriage .
Catherine Morland	She followed him in all his admiration as well as she could .
Catherine Morland	His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject , his rapidity of expression , and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power ; she could strike out nothing new in commendation , but she readily echoed whatever he chose to assert , and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most complete of its kind in England , his carriage the neatest , his horse the best goer , and himself the best coachman .
Catherine Morland	“ You do not really think , Mr. Thorpe , ” said Catherine , venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided , and to offer some little variation on the subject , “ that James ’s gig will break down ? ”
Catherine Morland	did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life ?
Catherine Morland	upon my soul , you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch .
Catherine Morland	“ Good heavens ! ” cried Catherine , quite frightened .
Catherine Morland	Do let us turn back , Mr. Thorpe ; stop and speak to my brother , and tell him how very unsafe it is . ”
Catherine Morland	Lord bless you !
Catherine Morland	i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again , without losing a nail . ” Catherine listened with astonishment ; she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing ; for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle , nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead .
Catherine Morland	Her own family were plain , matter - of - fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind ; her father , at the utmost , being contented with a pun , and her mother with a proverb ; they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance , or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next .
Catherine Morland	She reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity , and was more than once on the point of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject ; but she checked herself , because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights , in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous ; and , joining to this , the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve them
Catherine Morland	, she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe , and therefore would alarm herself no longer .
Catherine Morland	He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums ; of racing matches , in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner ; of shooting parties , in which he had killed more birds ( though without having one good shot ) than all his companions together ; and described to her some famous day ’s sport , with the fox - hounds , in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman , and in which the boldness of his riding , though it had never endangered his own life for a moment , had been constantly leading others into difficulties , which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many .
Catherine Morland	Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself , and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be , she could not entirely repress a doubt , while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit , of his being altogether completely agreeable .
Catherine Morland	It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure .
Catherine Morland	When they arrived at Mrs. Allen ’s door , the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed , on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house : “ Past three o’clock ! ”
Catherine Morland	and she would neither believe her own watch , nor her brother ’s , nor the servant ’s ; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality , till Morland produced his watch , and ascertained the fact ; to have doubted a moment longer _ then _ , would have been equally inconceivable , incredible , and impossible ; and she could only protest , over and over again , that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before , as Catherine was called on to confirm ; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella ; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend ’s dissenting voice , by not waiting for her answer .
Catherine Morland	Her own feelings entirely engrossed her ; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home .
Catherine Morland	It was ages since she had had a moment ’s conversation with her dearest Catherine ; and , though she had such thousands of things to say to her , it appeared as if they were never to be together again ; so , with smiles of most exquisite misery , and the laughing eye of utter despondency , she bade her friend adieu and went on .
Catherine Morland	Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning , and was immediately greeted with , “ Well , my dear , here you are , ” a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute ; “ and I hope you have had a pleasant airing ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , ma’am , I thank you ; we could not have had a nicer day . ”
Catherine Morland	“ So Mrs. Thorpe said ; she was vastly pleased at your all going . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You have seen Mrs. Thorpe , then ? ”
Catherine Morland	And did they speak to you ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ And what did she tell you of them ? ”
Catherine Morland	Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . ” “ And is Mr. Tilney , my partner , the only son ? ” “ I can not be quite positive about that , my dear ; I have some idea he is ; but , however , he is a very fine young man , Mrs. Hughes says , and likely to do very well .
Catherine Morland	Catherine inquired no further ; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give , and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister .
Catherine Morland	Could she have foreseen such a circumstance , nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others ; and , as it was , she could only lament her ill luck , and think over what she had lost , till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable .
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney , understanding in part her friend ’s curiosity to see the house , soon revived the subject ; and her father
Catherine Morland	being , contrary to Catherine ’s expectations , unprovided with any pretence for further delay , beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return , was at last ready to escort them . They set forward ; and , with a grandeur of air , a dignified step , which caught the eye , but could not shake the doubts of the well - read Catherine , he led the way across the hall , through the common drawing - room and one useless antechamber , into a room magnificent both in size and furniture — the real drawing - room , used only with company of consequence .
Catherine Morland	It was very noble — very grand — very charming!—was all that Catherine had to say , for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin ; and all minuteness of praise , all praise that had much meaning , was supplied by the General
Catherine Morland	: the costliness or elegance of any room ’s fitting - up could be nothing to her ; she cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century .
Catherine Morland	Catherine heard , admired , and wondered with more genuine feeling than before — gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge , by running over the titles of half a shelf , and was ready to proceed . But suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes .
Catherine Morland	Large as was the building , she had already visited the greatest part ; though , on being told that , with the addition of the kitchen , the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court , she could scarcely believe it , or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted .
Catherine Morland	It was some relief , however , that they were to return to the rooms in common use , by passing through a few of less importance , looking into the court , which , with occasional passages , not wholly unintricate , connected the different sides ; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister , having traces of cells pointed out , and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her — by finding herself successively in a billiard - room , and in the General ’s private apartment , without comprehending their connection , or being able to turn aright when she left them ; and lastly , by passing through a dark little room , owning Henry ’s authority , and strewed with his litter of books , guns , and greatcoats .
Catherine Morland	From the dining - room , of which , though already seen , and always to be seen at five o’clock , the General could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length , for the more certain information of Miss Morland , as to what she neither doubted nor cared for , they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen — the ancient kitchen of the convent , rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days , and in the stoves and hot closets of the present .
Catherine Morland	Catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest , for the purposes of mere domestic economy ; and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen ,
Catherine Morland	but if he had a vanity , it was in the arrangement of his offices ; and as he was convinced that , to a mind like Miss Morland ’s , a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened , must always be gratifying , he should make no apology for leading her on .
Catherine Morland	They took a slight survey of all ; and Catherine was impressed , beyond her expectation , by their multiplicity and their convenience .
Catherine Morland	The number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices .
Catherine Morland	how inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about — from abbeys and castles , in which , though certainly larger than Northanger , all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost .
Catherine Morland	How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself .
Catherine Morland	She was here shown successively into three large bed - chambers , with their dressing - rooms , most completely and handsomely fitted up ; everything that money and taste could do , to give comfort and elegance to apartments , had been bestowed on these ; and , being furnished within the last five years , they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing , and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine .
Catherine Morland	they were surveying the last , the General , after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured , turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine , and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be “ our friends from Fullerton . ”
Catherine Morland	She felt the unexpected compliment , and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself , and so full of civility to all her family .
Catherine Morland	The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ?
Catherine Morland	Miss Tilney drew back directly , and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine , who , having seen , in a momentary glance beyond them , a narrower passage , more numerous openings , and symptoms of a winding staircase , believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice ; and felt , as she unwillingly paced back the gallery , that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest .
Catherine Morland	Something was certainly to be concealed ; her fancy , though it had trespassed lately once or twice , could not mislead her here ; and
Catherine Morland	what that something was , a short sentence of Miss Tilney ’s , as they followed the General at some distance downstairs , seemed to point out : “ I was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ” were all her words ; but few as they were , they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine .
Catherine Morland	It was no wonder that the General should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain ; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed , which released his suffering wife , and left him to the stings of conscience .
Catherine Morland	She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour .
Catherine Morland	Catherine understood her : the General must be watched from home , before that room could be entered .
Catherine Morland	“ It remains as it was , I suppose ? ” said she , in a tone of feeling .
Catherine Morland	“ And how long ago may it be that your mother died ? ” “ She has been dead these nine years . ”
Catherine Morland	And nine years , Catherine knew , was a trifle of time , compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife , before her room was put to rights .
Catherine Morland	“ You were with her , I suppose , to the last ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , ” said Miss Tilney , sighing ; “ I was unfortunately from home .
Catherine Morland	Her illness was sudden and short ; and , before I arrived it was all over . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words .
Catherine Morland	and , when she saw him in the evening , while she worked with her friend , slowly pacing the drawing - room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness , with downcast eyes and contracted brow , she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him .
Catherine Morland	and the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly , as to catch Miss Tilney ’s notice .
Catherine Morland	“ My father , ” she whispered , “ often walks about the room in this way ; it is nothing unusual . ”
Catherine Morland	“ So much the worse ! ” thought Catherine ; such ill - timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks , and boded nothing good .
Catherine Morland	After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry ’s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell .
Catherine Morland	“ I have many pamphlets to finish , ” said he to Catherine , “ before I can close my eyes , and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep .
Catherine Morland	” But neither the business alleged , nor the magnificent compliment , could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose .
Catherine Morland	There must be some deeper cause : something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept ; and the probability that Mrs. Tilney yet lived , shut up for causes unknown , and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food , was the
Catherine Morland	Shocking as was the idea , it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened , as , in the natural course of things , she must ere long be released .
Catherine Morland	The suddenness of her reputed illness , the absence of her daughter , and probably of her other children , at the time — all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment .
Catherine Morland	In revolving these matters , while she undressed , it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman ’s confinement — might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days ; for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division ?
Catherine Morland	In the high - arched passage , paved with stone , which already she had trodden with peculiar awe , she well remembered the doors of which the General had given no account .
Catherine Morland	In support of the plausibility of this conjecture , it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery , in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney , must be , as certainly as her memory could guide her , exactly over this suspected range of cells , and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse , communicating by some secret means with those cells ,
Catherine Morland	might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband .
Catherine Morland	Down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well - prepared insensibility !
Catherine Morland	Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises , and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far ; but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible .
Catherine Morland	The side of the quadrangle , in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting , being , according to her belief , just opposite her own , it struck her that , if judiciously watched , some rays of light from the General ’s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows , as he passed to the prison of his wife ; and , twice before she stepped into bed , she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery , to see if it appeared ; but all abroad was dark , and it must yet be too early . The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up .
Catherine Morland	Till midnight , she supposed it would be in vain to watch ; but then , when the clock had struck twelve , and all was quiet , she would , if not quite appalled by darkness , steal out and look once more .
Catherine Morland	The clock struck twelve — and Catherine had been half an hour asleep .
Catherine Morland	31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start .
Catherine Morland	“ Catherine would make a sad , heedless young housekeeper to be sure , ” was her mother ’s foreboding remark ; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice .
Catherine Morland	Of a very considerable fortune , his son was , by marriage settlements , eventually secure ; his present income was an income of independence and comfort , and under every pecuniary view , it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter .
Catherine Morland	Henry returned to what was now his only home , to watch over his young plantations , and extend his improvements for her sake , to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward ; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry .
Catherine Morland	Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did — they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way .
Catherine Morland	The anxiety , which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine , and of all who loved either , as to its final event , can hardly extend , I fear , to the bosom of my readers , who will see in the tell - tale compression of the pages before them , that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity .
Catherine Morland	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ”
Catherine Morland	His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “ Your Ladyship ! ”
Catherine Morland	Her husband was really deserving of her ; independent of his peerage , his wealth , and his attachment , being to a precision the most charming young man in the world .
Catherine Morland	It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe ’s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it ; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor , and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds . This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride ; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence , which he was at some pains to procure , that the Fullerton estate , being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor , was consequently open to every greedy speculation .
Catherine Morland	The event which it authorized soon followed : Henry and Catherine were married , the bells rang , and everybody smiled ; and , as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting
Catherine Morland	for , though Henry was now sincerely attached to her , though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society
Catherine Morland	, I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude , or , in other words , that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought .
Catherine Morland	A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application .
Catherine Morland	Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand .
Catherine Morland	The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight .
Catherine Morland	The General had had nothing to accuse her of , nothing to lay to her charge , but her being the involuntary , unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon , and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own .
Catherine Morland	She was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be .
Catherine Morland	Under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims , he had courted her acquaintance in Bath , solicited her company at Northanger , and designed her for his daughter - in - law .
Catherine Morland	On discovering his error , to turn her from the house seemed the best , though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself , and his contempt of her family .
Catherine Morland	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
Catherine Morland	For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate .
Catherine Morland	Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter ; and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed .
Catherine Morland	Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this , than his own children .
Catherine Morland	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
Catherine Morland	I leave it to my reader ’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine , how much of it he could have learnt from his father , in what points his own conjectures might assist him , and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James .
Catherine Morland	Catherine , at any rate , heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife , she had scarcely sinned against his character , or magnified his cruelty .
Catherine Morland	Henry ’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated , on comprehending his father ’s views , and being ordered to acquiesce in them , had been open and bold .
Catherine Morland	He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand .
Catherine Morland	The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath ; and whether it should be the last was for some time a question , to which Catherine listened with a beating heart .
Catherine Morland	To have her acquaintance with the Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance .
Catherine Morland	Her whole happiness seemed at stake , while the affair was in suspense , and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should be taken for another fortnight .
Catherine Morland	What this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine ’s speculation .
Catherine Morland	Once or twice indeed , since James ’s engagement had taught her what _ could _ be done , she had got so far as to indulge in a secret “ perhaps , ” but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views : the present was now comprised in another three weeks , and her happiness being certain for that period , the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest .
Catherine Morland	In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged , she visited Miss Tilney , and poured
Catherine Morland	forth her joyful feelings
Catherine Morland	No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen ’s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father ’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week . Here was a blow !
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s countenance fell , and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney ’s concluding words , “ By the end of another week ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial .
Catherine Morland	“ I am very sorry for it , ” said Catherine dejectedly ; “ if I had known this before — ” “ Perhaps , ” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding .
Catherine Morland	After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , “ Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ” “ I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ” “ Well , proceed by all means .
Catherine Morland	I know how much your heart is in it .
Catherine Morland	’ Tis true , we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place ; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour , for our mode of living , as you see , is plain and unpretending ; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable .
Catherine Morland	these were thrilling words , and wound up Catherine ’s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy .
Catherine Morland	Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness .
Catherine Morland	To receive so flattering an invitation ! to have her company so warmly solicited !
Catherine Morland	everything honourable and soothing , every present enjoyment , and every future hope was contained in it ; and her acceptance , with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma ’s approbation , was eagerly given .
Catherine Morland	“ I will write home directly , ” said she , “ and if they do not object , as I dare say they will not — ” General Tilney was not less sanguine , having already waited on her excellent friends in Pulteney Street , and obtained their sanction of his wishes .
Catherine Morland	“ Since they can consent to part with you , ” said he , “ we may expect philosophy from all the world . ”
Catherine Morland	The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine ’s feelings through the varieties of suspense , security , and disappointment ; but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss ; and with spirits elated to rapture ,
Catherine Morland	with Henry at her heart , and Northanger Abbey on her lips , she hurried home to write her letter .
Catherine Morland	their daughter
Catherine Morland	, felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye , and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire .
Catherine Morland	This indulgence , though not more than Catherine had hoped for , completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature , in friends and fortune , circumstance and chance .
Catherine Morland	Everything seemed to cooperate for her advantage .
Catherine Morland	By the kindness of her first friends , the Allens , she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her .
Catherine Morland	Her feelings , her preferences , had each known the happiness of a return .
Catherine Morland	Wherever she felt attachment , she had been able to create it .
Catherine Morland	The affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister .
Catherine Morland	The Tilneys , they , by whom , above all , she desired to be favourably thought of , outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued .
Catherine Morland	She was to be their chosen visitor , she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized — and , in addition to all the rest , this roof was to be the roof of an abbey !
Catherine Morland	her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney — and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill
Catherine Morland	With all the chances against her of house , hall , place , park , court , and cottage , Northanger turned up an abbey , and she was to be its inhabitant .
Catherine Morland	“ But pray tell me what you mean . ”
Catherine Morland	Do you really desire it ?
Catherine Morland	But you are not aware of the consequences
Catherine Morland	; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment , and certainly bring on a disagreement between us . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , no ; it shall not do either ; I am not afraid . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine blushed and disclaimed , and the gentleman ’s predictions were verified .
Catherine Morland	There was a something , however , in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion ; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time , forgetting to speak or to listen , and almost forgetting where she was ; till , roused by the voice of Isabella , she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across .
Catherine Morland	Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled , the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given ; but as it was not quite enough for Catherine ’s comprehension , she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner .
Catherine Morland	but , because — And your brother !
Catherine Morland	after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ” “ I can not take surprise to myself on that head .
Catherine Morland	You bid me be surprised on your friend ’s account , and therefore I am ; but
Catherine Morland	The fairness of your friend was an open attraction ; her firmness , you know , could only be understood by yourself . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . ”
Catherine Morland	The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle !
Catherine Morland	it would have looked so particular ; and you know how I abhor doing that .
Catherine Morland	You have no idea how he pressed me .
Catherine Morland	Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening .
Catherine Morland	I took him down several times , you know , in my way . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled .
Catherine Morland	For myself , it is nothing ; I never think of myself . ” “ I know you never do , my dear ; and you will always find your reward in
Catherine Morland	the affection it makes everybody feel for you
Catherine Morland	There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child — but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things .
Catherine Morland	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
Catherine Morland	Catherine was hurt by these insinuations .
Catherine Morland	“ I am very sure , ” said she , “ that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford . ”
Catherine Morland	“ As to that , my sweet Catherine , there can not be a doubt , and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me .
Catherine Morland	my Catherine , you have found me out .
Catherine Morland	The long , long , endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , yes , my darling Isabella , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , “ we perfectly see into your heart .
Catherine Morland	Catherine ’s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen .
Catherine Morland	She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella ’s regret ; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever , endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise .
General Tilney	16 Catherine ’s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable ; and accordingly , though she was most politely received by General Tilney , and kindly welcomed by his daughter , though Henry was at home , and no one else of the party , she found , on her return , without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings , that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded .
General Tilney	, from the intercourse of the day , she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before ; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever , in the ease of a family party , he had never said so little , nor been so little agreeable ; and , in spite of their father ’s great civilities to her — in spite of his thanks , invitations , and compliments — it had been a release to get away from him .
General Tilney	It could not be General Tilney ’s fault .
General Tilney	That he was perfectly agreeable and good - natured , and altogether a very charming man , did not admit of a doubt , for he was tall and handsome , and Henry ’s father .
General Tilney	_ He _ could not be accountable for his children ’s want of spirits , or for her want of enjoyment in his company .
General Tilney	“ But as for General Tilney , I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention ; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy . ”
General Tilney	i know no harm of him ; I do not suspect him of pride .
General Tilney	I believe he is a very gentleman - like man .
General Tilney	John thinks very well of him , and John ’s judgment — ” “ Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . ”
General Tilney	, from the intercourse of the day , she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before ; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever , in the ease of a family party , he had never said so little , nor been so little agreeable ; and , in spite of their father ’s great civilities to her — in spite of his thanks , invitations , and compliments — it had been a release to get away from him .
General Tilney	That he was perfectly agreeable and good - natured , and altogether a very charming man , did not admit of a doubt , for he was tall and handsome , and Henry ’s father .
General Tilney	the kind intentions of his father fully explained .
General Tilney	A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children .
General Tilney	Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled .
General Tilney	“ I am very sure , ” said she , “ that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford . ”
General Tilney	Miss Tilney ’s manners and Henry ’s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings ; but still she was far from being at ease ; nor could the incessant attentions of the General himself entirely reassure her .
General Tilney	His anxiety for her comfort — his continual solicitations that she would eat , and his often - expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste — though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast - table — made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor .
General Tilney	Her tranquillity was not improved by the General ’s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son , nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down .
General Tilney	She was quite pained by the severity of his father ’s reproof , which seemed disproportionate to the offence ; and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture , and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her .
General Tilney	He listened to his father in silence , and attempted not any defence , which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind , on Isabella ’s account , might , by keeping him long sleepless , have been the real cause of his rising late .
General Tilney	It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company , and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him ; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room ; and even afterwards , so much were his spirits affected , she could distinguish nothing but these words , in a whisper to Eleanor , “ How glad I shall be when you are all off .
General Tilney	The clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down , and the General had fixed to be out of Milsom Street by that hour .
General Tilney	His greatcoat , instead of being brought for him to put on directly , was spread out in the curricle in which he was to accompany his son .
General Tilney	The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out , though there were three people to go in it , and his daughter ’s maid had so crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit ; and , so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in , that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing - desk from being thrown out into the street .
General Tilney	Had their party been perfectly agreeable , the delay would have been nothing ; but General Tilney , though so charming a man , seemed always a check upon his children ’s spirits , and scarcely anything was said but by himself ;
General Tilney	the observation of which , with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded , and his angry impatience at the waiters , made Catherine grow every moment more in awe of him , and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four .
General Tilney	At last , however , the order of release was given ; and much was Catherine then surprised by the General ’s proposal of her taking his place in his son ’s curricle for the rest of the journey
General Tilney	: “ the day was fine , and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible . ”
General Tilney	The remembrance of Mr. Allen ’s opinion , respecting young men ’s open carriages , made her blush at the mention of such a plan , and her first thought was to decline it ; but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney ’s judgment ; he could not propose anything improper for her ; and , in the course of a few minutes , she found herself with Henry in the curricle , as happy a being as ever existed . A very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world ; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur , to be sure , but it was a heavy and troublesome business , and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France .
General Tilney	Half the time would have been enough for the curricle , and so nimbly were the light horses disposed to move , that , had not the General chosen to have his own carriage lead the way , they could have passed it with ease in half a minute .
General Tilney	His sister , he said , was uncomfortably circumstanced — she had no female companion — and , in the frequent absence of her father , was sometimes without any companion at all .
General Tilney	“ Northanger is not more than half my home ; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston , which is nearly twenty miles from my father ’s , and some of my time is necessarily spent there . ”
General Tilney	A sudden scud of rain , driving full in her face , made it impossible for her to observe anything further , and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet ; and she was actually under the abbey walls , was springing , with Henry ’s assistance , from the carriage , was beneath the shelter of the old porch , and had even passed on to the hall , where her friend and the General were waiting to welcome her , without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to herself , or one moment ’s suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice .
General Tilney	The windows , to which she looked with peculiar dependence , from having heard the General talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with
General Tilney	The General , perceiving how her eye was employed , began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture , where everything , being for daily use , pretended only to comfort , etc . ; flattering himself , however , that there were some apartments in the Abbey not unworthy her notice — and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular , when , taking out his watch , he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five !
General Tilney	Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point , she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything , as she greatly dreaded disobliging the General by any delay .
General Tilney	Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace .
General Tilney	Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the General , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill - sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating - room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , “ that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ”
General Tilney	The General ’s good humour increased .
General Tilney	Why , as he _ had _ such rooms , he thought it would be simple not to make use of them ; but , upon his honour , he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size .
General Tilney	Mr. Allen ’s house , he was sure , must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness .
General Tilney	Their persuasion that the General would , upon this ground alone , independent of the objection that might be raised against her character , oppose the connection , turned her
General Tilney	The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality , which , as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions , she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the General ; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money ,
General Tilney	which she had more than once heard him utter , and which tempted her to think
General Tilney	his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children
General Tilney	But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella ’s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations .
General Tilney	She proposed it to him accordingly ; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected .
General Tilney	The General , meanwhile , though offended every morning by Frederick ’s remissness in writing , was free from any real anxiety about him , and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland ’s time at Northanger pass pleasantly .
General Tilney	He often expressed his uneasiness on this head , feared the sameness of every day ’s society and employments would disgust her with the place , wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country , talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner , and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood .
General Tilney	“ But how can you think of such a thing , after what the General said ?
General Tilney	When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble , because _ anything _ would do . ”
General Tilney	You must know it to be so ; and the General made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . ” “ I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own .
General Tilney	He went ; and , it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry ’s , she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right , however disagreeable to her his going .
General Tilney	But the inexplicability of the General ’s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts .
General Tilney	That he was very particular in his eating , she had , by her own unassisted observation , already discovered ; but why he should say one thing so positively , and mean another all the while , was most unaccountable !
General Tilney	Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler ’s shops which they passed .
General Tilney	Catherine ’s mind was too full , as she entered the house , for her either to observe or to say a great deal ; and , till called on by the General for her opinion of it , she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting .
General Tilney	Upon looking round it then , she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world ; but she was too guarded to say so , and the coldness of her praise disappointed him .
General Tilney	“ We are not calling it a good house , ” said he .
General Tilney	“ We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger — we are considering it as a mere parsonage , small and confined , we allow , but decent , perhaps , and habitable ; and altogether not inferior to the generality ; or , in other words , I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good .
General Tilney	Far be it from me to say otherwise ; and anything in reason — a bow thrown out , perhaps —
General Tilney	though , between ourselves , if there is one thing more than another my aversion , it is a patched - on bow .
General Tilney	Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits .
General Tilney	The room in question was of a commodious , well - proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining - parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing - room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the General .
General Tilney	why do not you fit up this room , Mr. Tilney ?
General Tilney	“ I trust , ” said the General , with a most satisfied smile , “ that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady ’s taste ! ”
General Tilney	“ Well , if it was my house , I should never sit anywhere else .
General Tilney	” Such a compliment recalled all Catherine ’s consciousness , and silenced her directly ; and , though pointedly applied to by the General for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings , nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her .
General Tilney	She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the General ; nay , that he was even looking at the side - table for cold meat which was not there .
General Tilney	His son and daughter ’s observations were of a different kind .
General Tilney	They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own , and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter ’s being oiled . At six o’clock , the General having taken his coffee , the carriage again received them ; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit , so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations , that , could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son , Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it .
General Tilney	Catherine took up her work directly , saying , in a dejected voice , that “ her head did not run upon Bath — much . ” “ Then you are fretting about General Tilney , and that is very simple of you ; for ten to one whether you ever see him again .
General Tilney	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
General Tilney	Catherine , at any rate , heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife , she had scarcely sinned against his character , or magnified his cruelty .
General Tilney	Far from comprehending him or his sister in their father ’s misconduct , Mrs. Morland had been always kindly disposed towards each , and instantly , pleased by his appearance , received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence ; thanking him for such an attention to her daughter , assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there , and entreating him to say not another word of the past .
General Tilney	Desirous of Mr. Morland ’s assistance , as well in giving encouragement , as in finding conversation for her guest , whose embarrassment on his father ’s account she earnestly pitied , Mrs. Morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him ; but Mr. Morland was from home — and being thus without any support , at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say .
General Tilney	“ You may see the house from this window , sir , ” was information on Sarah ’s side , which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman , and a silencing nod from her mother ; for Mrs. Morland , thinking it probable , as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours , that he might have some explanation to give of his father ’s behaviour , which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine , would not on any account prevent her accompanying him .
General Tilney	Some explanation on his father ’s account he had to give ; but his first purpose was to explain himself , and before they reached
General Tilney	On his return from Woodston , two days before , he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland ’s departure , and ordered to think of her no more .
General Tilney	The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight .
General Tilney	The General had had nothing to accuse her of , nothing to lay to her charge , but her being the involuntary , unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon , and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own .
General Tilney	She was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be .
General Tilney	Under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims , he had courted her acquaintance in Bath , solicited her company at Northanger , and designed her for his daughter - in - law .
General Tilney	On discovering his error , to turn her from the house seemed the best , though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself , and his contempt of her family .
General Tilney	John Thorpe had first misled him .
General Tilney	The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name .
General Tilney	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light .
General Tilney	For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate .
General Tilney	Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter ; and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed .
General Tilney	Upon such intelligence the General had proceeded ; for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority .
General Tilney	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
General Tilney	The General needed no more .
General Tilney	I leave it to my reader ’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine , how much of it he could have learnt from his father , in what points his own conjectures might assist him , and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James .
General Tilney	Henry , in having such things to relate of his father , was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself .
General Tilney	Henry ’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated , on comprehending his father ’s views , and being ordered to acquiesce in them , had been open and bold .
General Tilney	The General , accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family , prepared for no reluctance but of feeling , no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words , could ill brook the opposition of his son , steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it .
General Tilney	But , in such a cause , his anger , though it must shock , could not intimidate Henry , who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice .
General Tilney	He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand .
General Tilney	The General was furious in his anger , and they parted in dreadful disagreement .
General Tilney	Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point , she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything , as she greatly dreaded disobliging the General by any delay .
General Tilney	Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace .
General Tilney	Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the General , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill - sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating - room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , “ that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ”
General Tilney	The General ’s good humour increased .
General Tilney	Why , as he _ had _ such rooms , he thought it would be simple not to make use of them ; but , upon his honour , he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size .
General Tilney	Mr. Allen ’s house , he was sure , must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness .
General Tilney	The evening passed without any further disturbance , and , in the occasional absence of General Tilney , with much positive cheerfulness .
General Tilney	It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey ; and even then , even in moments of languor or restraint , a sense of general happiness preponderated , and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them .
General Tilney	An hour passed away before the General came in , spent , on the part of his young guest , in no very favourable consideration of his character .
General Tilney	At length he appeared ; and , whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations , he could still smile with _ them _ .
General Tilney	being , contrary to Catherine ’s expectations , unprovided with any pretence for further delay , beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return , was at last ready to escort them . They set forward ; and , with a grandeur of air , a dignified step , which caught the eye , but could not shake the doubts of the well - read Catherine , he led the way across the hall , through the common drawing - room and one useless antechamber , into a room magnificent both in size and furniture — the real drawing - room , used only with company of consequence .
General Tilney	It was very noble — very grand — very charming!—was all that Catherine had to say , for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin ; and all minuteness of praise , all praise that had much meaning , was supplied by the General
General Tilney	When the General had satisfied his own curiosity , in a close examination of every well - known ornament , they proceeded into the library , an apartment , in its way , of equal magnificence , exhibiting a collection of books , on which an humble man might have looked with pride .
General Tilney	It was some relief , however , that they were to return to the rooms in common use , by passing through a few of less importance , looking into the court , which , with occasional passages , not wholly unintricate , connected the different sides ; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister , having traces of cells pointed out , and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her — by finding herself successively in a billiard - room , and in the General ’s private apartment , without comprehending their connection , or being able to turn aright when she left them ; and lastly , by passing through a dark little room , owning Henry ’s authority , and strewed with his litter of books , guns , and greatcoats .
General Tilney	From the dining - room , of which , though already seen , and always to be seen at five o’clock , the General could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length , for the more certain information of Miss Morland , as to what she neither doubted nor cared for , they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen — the ancient kitchen of the convent , rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days , and in the stoves and hot closets of the present .
General Tilney	The General ’s improving hand had not loitered here : every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this , their spacious theatre ; and , when the genius of others had failed , his own had often produced the perfection wanted .
General Tilney	His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent .
General Tilney	With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey ; the fourth side of the quadrangle having , on account of its decaying state , been removed by the General ’s father , and the present erected in its place .
General Tilney	had the General allowed it
General Tilney	but if he had a vanity , it was in the arrangement of his offices ; and as he was convinced that , to a mind like Miss Morland ’s , a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened , must always be gratifying , he should make no apology for leading her on .
General Tilney	they were surveying the last , the General , after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured , turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine , and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be “ our friends from Fullerton . ”
General Tilney	The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ?
General Tilney	The General ’s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant .
General Tilney	what that something was , a short sentence of Miss Tilney ’s , as they followed the General at some distance downstairs , seemed to point out : “ I was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ” were all her words ; but few as they were , they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine .
General Tilney	It was no wonder that the General should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain ; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed , which released his suffering wife , and left him to the stings of conscience .
General Tilney	Catherine understood her : the General must be watched from home , before that room could be entered .
General Tilney	After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry ’s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell .
General Tilney	“ I have many pamphlets to finish , ” said he to Catherine , “ before I can close my eyes , and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep .
General Tilney	_ My _ eyes will be blinding for the good of others , and _ yours _ preparing by rest for future mischief .
General Tilney	There must be some deeper cause : something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept ; and the probability that Mrs. Tilney yet lived , shut up for causes unknown , and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food , was the
General Tilney	In the high - arched passage , paved with stone , which already she had trodden with peculiar awe , she well remembered the doors of which the General had given no account .
General Tilney	might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband .
General Tilney	The side of the quadrangle , in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting , being , according to her belief , just opposite her own , it struck her that , if judiciously watched , some rays of light from the General ’s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows , as he passed to the prison of his wife ; and , twice before she stepped into bed , she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery , to see if it appeared ; but all abroad was dark , and it must yet be too early . The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up .
General Tilney	But he thought he could discern .
General Tilney	Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland ’s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather .
General Tilney	He yielded implicitly , and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment . ”
General Tilney	He left the room , and Catherine , with a disappointed , anxious face , began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination , under a mistaken idea of pleasing her ; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney ’s saying , with a little confusion , “ I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father ’s account ; he always walks out at this time of day .
General Tilney	Could there be any unwillingness on the General ’s side to show her over the abbey ?
General Tilney	The proposal was his own .
General Tilney	And was not it odd that he should _ always _ take his walk so early ?
General Tilney	Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so .
General Tilney	The General listened with assenting gratitude ; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour .
General Tilney	The kitchen - garden was to be next admired , and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park .
General Tilney	The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay , being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen ’s , as well as her father ’s , including church - yard and orchard .
General Tilney	The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , “ without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom .
General Tilney	If he had a hobby - horse , it was _ that _ .
General Tilney	He loved a garden .
General Tilney	Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit — or if he did not , his friends and children did .
General Tilney	There were great vexations , however , attending such a garden as his .
General Tilney	Mr. Allen , he supposed , must feel these inconveniences as well as himself . ”
General Tilney	Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . ”
General Tilney	With a triumphant smile of self - satisfaction , the General wished he could do the same , for he never entered his , without being vexed in some way or other , by its falling short of his plan .
General Tilney	“ How were Mr. Allen ’s succession - houses worked ? ” describing the nature of his own as they entered them .
General Tilney	“ Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then .
General Tilney	“ He is a happy man ! ” said the General , with a look of very happy contempt .
General Tilney	Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired .
General Tilney	It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the General ’s disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward .
General Tilney	He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition .
General Tilney	He excused himself , however , from attending them : “ The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . ”
General Tilney	He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . “ I am particularly fond of this spot , ” said her companion , with a sigh .
General Tilney	Yet the General would not enter it . ”
General Tilney	The General certainly had been an unkind husband .
General Tilney	He did not love her walk : could he therefore have loved her ?
General Tilney	And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . “ Her picture , I suppose , ” blushing at the consummate art of her own question , “ hangs in your father ’s room ? ” “ No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place .
General Tilney	Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ” Here was another proof .
General Tilney	A portrait — very like — of a departed wife , not valued by the husband !
General Tilney	he must have been dreadfully cruel to her !
General Tilney	Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which , in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited ; and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion .
General Tilney	his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her .
General Tilney	She had often read of such characters , characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn ; but here was proof positive of the contrary .
General Tilney	She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the General ; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation , she found herself again obliged to walk with him , listen to him , and even to smile when he smiled .
General Tilney	began to walk with lassitude ; the General perceived it , and with a concern for her health , which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him , was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house .
General Tilney	He would follow them in a quarter of an hour .
General Tilney	Again they parted — but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return .
General Tilney	This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable .
General Tilney	while his parent so expressly forbade the connection , they could not allow themselves to encourage it . That the General should come forward to solicit the alliance , or that he should even very heartily approve it , they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation ; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded , and that once obtained — and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied — their willing approbation was instantly to follow .
General Tilney	His _ consent _ was all that they wished for .
General Tilney	They were no more inclined than entitled to demand his _ money _ .
General Tilney	Of a very considerable fortune , his son was , by marriage settlements , eventually secure ; his present income was an income of independence and comfort , and under every pecuniary view , it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter .
General Tilney	They felt and they deplored — but they could not resent it ; and they parted , endeavouring to hope that such a change in the General , as each believed almost impossible , might speedily take place , to unite them again in the fulness of privileged affection .
General Tilney	The means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt : what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the General ’s ?
General Tilney	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ”
General Tilney	The marriage of Eleanor Tilney , her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry ’s banishment , to the home of her choice and the man of her choice , is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance .
General Tilney	Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin ; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her .
General Tilney	His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “ Your Ladyship ! ”
General Tilney	Her husband was really deserving of her ; independent of his peerage , his wealth , and his attachment , being to a precision the most charming young man in the world .
General Tilney	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give .
General Tilney	It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe ’s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it ; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor , and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds . This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride ; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence , which he was at some pains to procure , that the Fullerton estate , being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor , was consequently open to every greedy speculation .
General Tilney	On the strength of this , the General , soon after Eleanor ’s marriage , permitted his son to return to Northanger , and thence made him the bearer of his consent , very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland .
General Tilney	, it will not appear , after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the General ’s cruelty , that they were essentially hurt by it .
General Tilney	is to do pretty well ; and professing myself moreover convinced that the General ’s unjust interference , so far from being really injurious to their felicity , was perhaps rather conducive to it , by improving their knowledge of each other , and adding strength to their attachment , I leave it to be settled , by whomsoever it may concern , whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny , or reward filial disobedience .
General Tilney	It was Sunday , and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the General in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home ; and great as was Catherine ’s curiosity , her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner , either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o’clock , or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp .
General Tilney	That the General , having erected such a monument , should be able to face it , was not perhaps very strange , and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view , maintain so elevated an air , look so fearlessly around , nay , that he should even enter the church , seemed wonderful to Catherine .
General Tilney	The General ’s early walk , ill - timed as it was in every other view , was favourable here ; and when she knew him to be out of the house , she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise .
General Tilney	Again she passed through the folding doors , again her hand was upon the important lock , and Catherine , hardly able to breathe , was turning to close the former with fearful caution , when the figure , the dreaded figure of the General himself at the further end of the gallery , stood before her !
General Tilney	the name of “ Eleanor ” at the same moment , in his loudest tone
General Tilney	, resounded through the building , giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence , and to Catherine terror upon terror .
General Tilney	An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him , yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye ; and when her friend , who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her , had joined and disappeared with him , she ran for safety to her own room , and , locking herself in , believed that she should never have courage to go down again .
General Tilney	She remained there at least an hour , in the greatest agitation , deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend , and expecting a summons herself from the angry General to attend him in his own apartment .
General Tilney	No summons , however , arrived ; and at last , on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey , she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors .
General Tilney	The breakfast - room was gay with company ; and she was named to them by the General as the friend of his daughter , in a complimentary style , which so well concealed his resentful ire , as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present .
General Tilney	And Eleanor , with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character , taking an early occasion of saying to her , “ My father only wanted me to answer a note , ” she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the General , or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so .
General Tilney	Upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence , after the company left them , and nothing occurred to disturb it .
General Tilney	The General ’s utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter ; and , besides , she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion .
General Tilney	It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions , from which the other had , in all likelihood , been hitherto happily exempt ; nor could she therefore , in _ her _ presence , search for those proofs of the General ’s cruelty , which however they might yet have escaped discovery , she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth , in the shape of some fragmented journal , continued to the last gasp .
General Tilney	this apartment , to which she had given a date so ancient , a position so awful , proved to be one end of what the General ’s father had built .
General Tilney	No : whatever might have been the General ’s crimes , he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection .
General Tilney	To be found there , even by a servant , would be unpleasant ; but by the General ( and he seemed always at hand when least wanted ) , much worse !
General Tilney	she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday — and we were coming here to these rooms — but only , ” dropping her voice , “ your father was with us . ” “ And that prevented you , ” said Henry , earnestly regarding her .
General Tilney	Her dying so suddenly ” ( slowly , and with hesitation it was spoken ) , “ and you — none of you being at home — and your father , I thought — perhaps had not been very fond of her . ” “ And from these circumstances , ” he replied ( his quick eye fixed on hers ) , “ you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence — some”—(involuntarily she shook her head)—“or it may be — of something still less pardonable . ”
General Tilney	“ But your father , ” said Catherine , “ was _ he _ afflicted ? ” “ For a time , greatly so .
General Tilney	You have erred in supposing him not attached to her .
General Tilney	He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to — we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition — and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did .
General Tilney	His value of her was sincere ; and , if not permanently , he was truly afflicted by her death .
General Tilney	28 Soon after this , the General found himself obliged to go to London for a week ; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland ’s company , and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence .
General Tilney	His departure gave Catherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain .
General Tilney	The happiness with which their time now passed , every employment voluntary , every laugh indulged , every meal a scene of ease and good humour , walking where they liked and when they liked , their hours , pleasures , and fatigues at their own command , made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the General ’s presence had imposed , and most thankfully feel their present release from it .
General Tilney	Such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day ; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one , and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other , she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy ; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit ; before the General came home , the fourth week would be turned , and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer .
General Tilney	His loss was not now what it had been while the General was at home ; it lessened their gaiety , but did not ruin their comfort ; and the two girls agreeing in occupation , and improving in intimacy , found themselves so well sufficient for the time to themselves , that it was eleven o’clock , rather a late hour at the abbey , before they quitted the supper - room on the day of Henry ’s departure .
General Tilney	The General will send a servant with me , I dare say , half the way — and then I shall soon be at Salisbury , and then I am only nine miles from home . ”
General Tilney	“ Have I offended the General ? ” said Catherine in a faltering voice .
General Tilney	for my feelings as a daughter , all that I know , all that I answer for , is that you can have given him no just cause of offence .
General Tilney	Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared .
General Tilney	The liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father — could he ever forgive it ?
General Tilney	after my father ’s consent had been so kindly given — but no more of this .
General Tilney	I have written to him and my father .
General Tilney	He was prevented , however , from even looking his surprise by his father ’s entrance .
General Tilney	The General , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible .
General Tilney	“ What was her father ? ” “ A lawyer , I believe .
General Tilney	Your father is so very liberal !
General Tilney	He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children . ”
General Tilney	I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more .
General Tilney	Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler ’s shops which they passed .
General Tilney	Catherine ’s mind was too full , as she entered the house , for her either to observe or to say a great deal ; and , till called on by the General for her opinion of it , she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting .
General Tilney	Upon looking round it then , she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world ; but she was too guarded to say so , and the coldness of her praise disappointed him .
General Tilney	“ We are not calling it a good house , ” said he .
General Tilney	“ We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger — we are considering it as a mere parsonage , small and confined , we allow , but decent , perhaps , and habitable ; and altogether not inferior to the generality ; or , in other words , I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good .
General Tilney	Far be it from me to say otherwise ; and anything in reason — a bow thrown out , perhaps —
General Tilney	though , between ourselves , if there is one thing more than another my aversion , it is a patched - on bow .
General Tilney	Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits .
General Tilney	The room in question was of a commodious , well - proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining - parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing - room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the General .
General Tilney	why do not you fit up this room , Mr. Tilney ?
General Tilney	“ I trust , ” said the General , with a most satisfied smile , “ that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady ’s taste ! ”
General Tilney	“ Well , if it was my house , I should never sit anywhere else .
General Tilney	” Such a compliment recalled all Catherine ’s consciousness , and silenced her directly ; and , though pointedly applied to by the General for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings , nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her .
General Tilney	She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the General ; nay , that he was even looking at the side - table for cold meat which was not there .
General Tilney	His son and daughter ’s observations were of a different kind .
General Tilney	They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own , and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter ’s being oiled . At six o’clock , the General having taken his coffee , the carriage again received them ; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit , so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations , that , could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son , Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it .
General Tilney	It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage .
General Tilney	Yes , only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard — had he even confused her by his too significant reference ! and now — what had she done , or what had she omitted to do , to merit such a change ?
General Tilney	The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge .
General Tilney	To the General , of course , he would not dare to speak ; but to Eleanor — what might he not say to Eleanor about her ?
General Tilney	here , when the whole was unfolded , was an insult not to be overlooked , nor , for the first half hour , to be easily pardoned . Without suffering any romantic alarm , in the consideration of their daughter ’s long and lonely journey , Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her ; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered ; and that , in forcing her on such a measure , General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly — neither as a gentleman nor as a parent .
General Tilney	Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that “ it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , ” grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour .
General Tilney	“ I can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , ” said Sarah , “ but why not do it civilly ? ”
General Tilney	She could never forget Henry Tilney , or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment ; but he might forget her ; and in that case , to meet — !
General Tilney	“ She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house .
General Tilney	Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again !
General Tilney	and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ” Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself .
General Tilney	His wonder , his conjectures , and his explanations became in succession hers , with the addition of this single remark—“I really have not patience with the General”—to fill up every accidental pause .
General Tilney	And , “ I really have not patience with the General , ” was uttered twice after Mr. Allen left the room , without any relaxation of anger , or any material digression of thought .
General Tilney	Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable .
General Tilney	I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure .
General Tilney	Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I really have not patience with the General !
General Tilney	such an agreeable , worthy man as he seemed to be !
General Tilney	His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them , Catherine .
General Tilney	The General , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible .
General Tilney	It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage .

General Tilney	such an agreeable , worthy man as he seemed to be !
General Tilney	Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared .
General Tilney	Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the General , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind , but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure .
General Tilney	The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine ’s notice when they were seated at table ; and , luckily , it had been the General ’s choice .
General Tilney	He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste , confessed it to be neat and simple , thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country ; and for his part , to his uncritical palate , the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire , as from that of Dresden or Sêve .
General Tilney	The manufacture was much improved since that time ; he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town , and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind , might have been tempted to order a new set . He trusted , however , that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one — though not for himself .
General Tilney	Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him .
General Tilney	“ This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother ’s fortitude , ” observed the General to Eleanor .
General Tilney	I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations .
General Tilney	The house stands among fine meadows facing the south - east , with an excellent kitchen - garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son .
General Tilney	It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one .
General Tilney	Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business .
General Tilney	But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment .
General Tilney	Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession .
General Tilney	” The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes .
General Tilney	Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house , and he now offered himself as her conductor ; and
General Tilney	though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter , it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself , under any circumstances , not to be gladly accepted ; for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey , and had seen only a few of its rooms .
General Tilney	The netting - box , just leisurely drawn forth , was closed with joyful haste , and she was ready to attend him in a moment . “ And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . ”
General Tilney	He was equally at her service .
General Tilney	Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend ’s wishes ?
General Tilney	But he thought he could discern .
General Tilney	Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland ’s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather .
General Tilney	He yielded implicitly , and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment . ”
General Tilney	He left the room , and Catherine , with a disappointed , anxious face , began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination , under a mistaken idea of pleasing her ; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney ’s saying , with a little confusion , “ I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father ’s account ; he always walks out at this time of day .
General Tilney	Could there be any unwillingness on the General ’s side to show her over the abbey ?
General Tilney	The proposal was his own .
General Tilney	And was not it odd that he should _ always _ take his walk so early ?
General Tilney	Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so .
General Tilney	The General listened with assenting gratitude ; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour .
General Tilney	The kitchen - garden was to be next admired , and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park .
General Tilney	The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay , being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen ’s , as well as her father ’s , including church - yard and orchard .
General Tilney	The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , “ without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom .
General Tilney	If he had a hobby - horse , it was _ that _ .
General Tilney	He loved a garden .
General Tilney	Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit — or if he did not , his friends and children did .
General Tilney	There were great vexations , however , attending such a garden as his .
General Tilney	Mr. Allen , he supposed , must feel these inconveniences as well as himself . ”
General Tilney	Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . ”
General Tilney	With a triumphant smile of self - satisfaction , the General wished he could do the same , for he never entered his , without being vexed in some way or other , by its falling short of his plan .
General Tilney	“ How were Mr. Allen ’s succession - houses worked ? ” describing the nature of his own as they entered them .
General Tilney	“ Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then .
General Tilney	“ He is a happy man ! ” said the General , with a look of very happy contempt .
General Tilney	Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired .
General Tilney	It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the General ’s disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward .
General Tilney	He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition .
General Tilney	He excused himself , however , from attending them : “ The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . ”
General Tilney	He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . “ I am particularly fond of this spot , ” said her companion , with a sigh .
General Tilney	Yet the General would not enter it . ”
General Tilney	The General certainly had been an unkind husband .
General Tilney	He did not love her walk : could he therefore have loved her ?
General Tilney	And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . “ Her picture , I suppose , ” blushing at the consummate art of her own question , “ hangs in your father ’s room ? ” “ No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place .
General Tilney	Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ” Here was another proof .
General Tilney	A portrait — very like — of a departed wife , not valued by the husband !
General Tilney	he must have been dreadfully cruel to her !
General Tilney	Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which , in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited ; and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion .
General Tilney	his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her .
General Tilney	She had often read of such characters , characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn ; but here was proof positive of the contrary .
General Tilney	She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the General ; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation , she found herself again obliged to walk with him , listen to him , and even to smile when he smiled .
General Tilney	began to walk with lassitude ; the General perceived it , and with a concern for her health , which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him , was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house .
General Tilney	He would follow them in a quarter of an hour .
General Tilney	Again they parted — but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return .
General Tilney	This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable .
General Tilney	An hour passed away before the General came in , spent , on the part of his young guest , in no very favourable consideration of his character .
General Tilney	At length he appeared ; and , whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations , he could still smile with _ them _ .
General Tilney	It was very noble — very grand — very charming!—was all that Catherine had to say , for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin ; and all minuteness of praise , all praise that had much meaning , was supplied by the General
General Tilney	When the General had satisfied his own curiosity , in a close examination of every well - known ornament , they proceeded into the library , an apartment , in its way , of equal magnificence , exhibiting a collection of books , on which an humble man might have looked with pride .
General Tilney	It was some relief , however , that they were to return to the rooms in common use , by passing through a few of less importance , looking into the court , which , with occasional passages , not wholly unintricate , connected the different sides ; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister , having traces of cells pointed out , and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her — by finding herself successively in a billiard - room , and in the General ’s private apartment , without comprehending their connection , or being able to turn aright when she left them ; and lastly , by passing through a dark little room , owning Henry ’s authority , and strewed with his litter of books , guns , and greatcoats .
General Tilney	From the dining - room , of which , though already seen , and always to be seen at five o’clock , the General could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length , for the more certain information of Miss Morland , as to what she neither doubted nor cared for , they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen — the ancient kitchen of the convent , rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days , and in the stoves and hot closets of the present .
General Tilney	The General ’s improving hand had not loitered here : every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this , their spacious theatre ; and , when the genius of others had failed , his own had often produced the perfection wanted .
General Tilney	His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent .
General Tilney	With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey ; the fourth side of the quadrangle having , on account of its decaying state , been removed by the General ’s father , and the present erected in its place .
General Tilney	had the General allowed it
General Tilney	they were surveying the last , the General , after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured , turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine , and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be “ our friends from Fullerton . ”
General Tilney	The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ?
General Tilney	The General ’s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant .
General Tilney	what that something was , a short sentence of Miss Tilney ’s , as they followed the General at some distance downstairs , seemed to point out : “ I was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ” were all her words ; but few as they were , they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine .
General Tilney	It was no wonder that the General should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain ; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed , which released his suffering wife , and left him to the stings of conscience .
General Tilney	Catherine understood her : the General must be watched from home , before that room could be entered .
General Tilney	After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry ’s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell .
General Tilney	In the high - arched passage , paved with stone , which already she had trodden with peculiar awe , she well remembered the doors of which the General had given no account .
General Tilney	The side of the quadrangle , in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting , being , according to her belief , just opposite her own , it struck her that , if judiciously watched , some rays of light from the General ’s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows , as he passed to the prison of his wife ; and , twice before she stepped into bed , she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery , to see if it appeared ; but all abroad was dark , and it must yet be too early . The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up .
General Tilney	31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start .
General Tilney	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
General Tilney	Catherine , at any rate , heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife , she had scarcely sinned against his character , or magnified his cruelty .
General Tilney	while his parent so expressly forbade the connection , they could not allow themselves to encourage it . That the General should come forward to solicit the alliance , or that he should even very heartily approve it , they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation ; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded , and that once obtained — and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied — their willing approbation was instantly to follow .
General Tilney	His _ consent _ was all that they wished for .
General Tilney	They were no more inclined than entitled to demand his _ money _ .
General Tilney	Of a very considerable fortune , his son was , by marriage settlements , eventually secure ; his present income was an income of independence and comfort , and under every pecuniary view , it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter .
General Tilney	They felt and they deplored — but they could not resent it ; and they parted , endeavouring to hope that such a change in the General , as each believed almost impossible , might speedily take place , to unite them again in the fulness of privileged affection .
General Tilney	The means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt : what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the General ’s ?
General Tilney	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ”
General Tilney	His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “ Your Ladyship ! ”
General Tilney	Her husband was really deserving of her ; independent of his peerage , his wealth , and his attachment , being to a precision the most charming young man in the world .
General Tilney	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give .
General Tilney	It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe ’s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it ; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor , and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds . This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride ; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence , which he was at some pains to procure , that the Fullerton estate , being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor , was consequently open to every greedy speculation .
General Tilney	On the strength of this , the General , soon after Eleanor ’s marriage , permitted his son to return to Northanger , and thence made him the bearer of his consent , very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland .
General Tilney	, it will not appear , after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the General ’s cruelty , that they were essentially hurt by it .
General Tilney	is to do pretty well ; and professing myself moreover convinced that the General ’s unjust interference , so far from being really injurious to their felicity , was perhaps rather conducive to it , by improving their knowledge of each other , and adding strength to their attachment , I leave it to be settled , by whomsoever it may concern , whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny , or reward filial disobedience .
General Tilney	On his return from Woodston , two days before , he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland ’s departure , and ordered to think of her no more .
General Tilney	The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight .
General Tilney	The General had had nothing to accuse her of , nothing to lay to her charge , but her being the involuntary , unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon , and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own .
General Tilney	She was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be .
General Tilney	Under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims , he had courted her acquaintance in Bath , solicited her company at Northanger , and designed her for his daughter - in - law .
General Tilney	On discovering his error , to turn her from the house seemed the best , though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself , and his contempt of her family .
General Tilney	John Thorpe had first misled him .
General Tilney	The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name .
General Tilney	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light .
General Tilney	For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate .
General Tilney	Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter ; and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed .
General Tilney	Upon such intelligence the General had proceeded ; for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority .
General Tilney	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
General Tilney	The General needed no more .
General Tilney	I leave it to my reader ’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine , how much of it he could have learnt from his father , in what points his own conjectures might assist him , and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James .
General Tilney	Henry , in having such things to relate of his father , was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself .
General Tilney	Henry ’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated , on comprehending his father ’s views , and being ordered to acquiesce in them , had been open and bold .
General Tilney	The General , accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family , prepared for no reluctance but of feeling , no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words , could ill brook the opposition of his son , steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it .
General Tilney	But , in such a cause , his anger , though it must shock , could not intimidate Henry , who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice .
General Tilney	He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand .
General Tilney	The General was furious in his anger , and they parted in dreadful disagreement .
General Tilney	No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen ’s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father ’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week . Here was a blow !
General Tilney	“ Yes , my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial .
General Tilney	He has been disappointed of some friends ’ arrival whom he expected to meet here , and as he is now pretty well , is in a hurry to get home .
General Tilney	“ I am very sorry for it , ” said Catherine dejectedly ; “ if I had known this before — ” “ Perhaps , ” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding .
General Tilney	After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , “ Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ” “ I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ” “ Well , proceed by all means .
General Tilney	I know how much your heart is in it .
General Tilney	My daughter , Miss Morland , ” he continued , without leaving his daughter time to speak , “ has been forming a very bold wish .
General Tilney	A letter from my steward
General Tilney	tells me that my presence is wanted at home ; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here , some of my very old friends , there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath .
General Tilney	I am almost ashamed to make the request , though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself .
General Tilney	— but not for the world would I pain it by open praise .
General Tilney	the kind intentions of his father fully explained .
General Tilney	A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children .
General Tilney	Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled .
General Tilney	“ I am very sure , ” said she , “ that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford . ”
General Tilney	“ I will write home directly , ” said she , “ and if they do not object , as I dare say they will not — ” General Tilney was not less sanguine , having already waited on her excellent friends in Pulteney Street , and obtained their sanction of his wishes .
General Tilney	“ Since they can consent to part with you , ” said he , “ we may expect philosophy from all the world . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney
Eleanor Tilney	, from the intercourse of the day , she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before ; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever , in the ease of a family party , he had never said so little , nor been so little agreeable ; and , in spite of their father ’s great civilities to her — in spite of his thanks , invitations , and compliments — it had been a release to get away from him .
Eleanor Tilney	Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney ’s she had never heard of in her life !
Eleanor Tilney	not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding !
Eleanor Tilney	to behave to her guest with such superciliousness !
Eleanor Tilney	hardly even to speak to her ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ But it was not so bad as that , Isabella ; there was no superciliousness ; she was very civil . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Oh , do n’t defend her !
Eleanor Tilney	Miss Tilney took pains to be near her , and Henry asked her to dance .
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine , without hesitation , replied that she was very sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all .
Eleanor Tilney	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
Eleanor Tilney	When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour .
Eleanor Tilney	He listened to his father in silence , and attempted not any defence , which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind , on Isabella ’s account , might , by keeping him long sleepless , have been the real cause of his rising late .
Eleanor Tilney	It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company , and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him ; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room ; and even afterwards , so much were his spirits affected , she could distinguish nothing but these words , in a whisper to Eleanor , “ How glad I shall be when you are all off .
Eleanor Tilney	At last , however , the door was closed upon the three females , and they set off at the sober pace in which the handsome , highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles
Eleanor Tilney	“ I am always sorry to leave Eleanor . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Yes ; but besides your affection for her , you must be so fond of the abbey !
Eleanor Tilney	We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire — nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows , doors , or furniture .
Eleanor Tilney	This ill - timed intruder was Miss Tilney ’s maid , sent by her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland ; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her , it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing , and forced her , in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery , to proceed in her dressing without further delay .
Eleanor Tilney	She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney , anxious for her friend ’s being ready , entered the room , and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation , was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search .
Eleanor Tilney	That is a curious old chest , is not it ? ” said Miss Tilney , as Catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass .
Eleanor Tilney	How it came to be first put in this room I know not , but I have not had it moved , because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets .
Eleanor Tilney	Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace .
Eleanor Tilney	The evening passed without any further disturbance , and , in the occasional absence of General Tilney , with much positive cheerfulness .
Eleanor Tilney	It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey ; and even then , even in moments of languor or restraint , a sense of general happiness preponderated , and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them .
Eleanor Tilney	Thus wisely fortifying her mind , as she proceeded upstairs , she was enabled , especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her , to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart ; and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire .
Eleanor Tilney	She had left them for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney .
Eleanor Tilney	She had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk to - morrow ; it was quite determined , and she would not , upon any account , retract .
Eleanor Tilney	I am engaged to Miss Tilney .
Eleanor Tilney	“ It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement , and must only beg to put off the walk till Tuesday . ”
Eleanor Tilney	She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney , though she had known her so little a while , than for her best and oldest friends , with being grown cold and indifferent , in short , towards herself .
Eleanor Tilney	I have been to Miss Tilney , and made your excuses . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Left her this moment .
Eleanor Tilney	Told her you had sent me to say that , having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us to - morrow , you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday .
Eleanor Tilney	She said very well , Tuesday was just as convenient to her ; so there is an end of all our difficulties .
Eleanor Tilney	I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right . ”
Eleanor Tilney	When everything was settled , when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would suit her as well , it was quite ridiculous , quite absurd , to make any further objection .
Eleanor Tilney	If I had thought it right to put it off , I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself .
Eleanor Tilney	Setting her own inclination apart , to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney , to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before , and on a false pretence too , must have been wrong .
Eleanor Tilney	Her conviction of being right , however , was not enough to restore her composure ; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not be at ease ; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent
Eleanor Tilney	So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the Tilneys ’ advantage in the outset , they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them ; and the servant still remaining at the open door , she used only the ceremony of saying that she must speak with Miss Tilney that moment , and hurrying by him proceeded upstairs .
Eleanor Tilney	Then , opening the first door before her , which happened to be the right , she immediately found herself in the drawing - room with General Tilney , his son , and daughter .
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine found that John Thorpe _ had _ given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it .
Eleanor Tilney	The affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father , and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe ’s information to her mind , and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on .
Eleanor Tilney	To such anxious attention was the General ’s civility carried , that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house , he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself .
Eleanor Tilney	And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence , it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever , if not his place , by her rapidity . After sitting with them a quarter of an hour , she rose to take leave , and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney ’s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her .
Eleanor Tilney	Miss Tilney added her own wishes .
Eleanor Tilney	The General declared he could say no more ; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded ; but on some other day he trusted , when longer notice could be given , they would not refuse to spare her to her friend .
Eleanor Tilney	The General attended her himself to the street - door , saying everything gallant as they went downstairs , admiring the elasticity of her walk , which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing , and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld , when they parted .
Eleanor Tilney	“ No ; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it ; and therefore you know I could not go with them , could I ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine , relieved for herself , felt uneasy for Isabella , and after a moment ’s thought , asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe , and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself ; for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day , in spite of what had passed .
Eleanor Tilney	Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt ; but , however , you had better not interfere .
Eleanor Tilney	She and your brother choose to go , and you will be only getting ill will . ”
Eleanor Tilney	In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged , she visited Miss Tilney , and poured
Eleanor Tilney	No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen ’s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father ’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week . Here was a blow !
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine ’s countenance fell , and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney ’s concluding words , “ By the end of another week ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Yes , my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial .
Eleanor Tilney	“ I am very sorry for it , ” said Catherine dejectedly ; “ if I had known this before — ” “ Perhaps , ” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding .
Eleanor Tilney	After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , “ Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ” “ I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ” “ Well , proceed by all means .
Eleanor Tilney	“ I will write home directly , ” said she , “ and if they do not object , as I dare say they will not — ” General Tilney was not less sanguine , having already waited on her excellent friends in Pulteney Street , and obtained their sanction of his wishes .
Eleanor Tilney	“ Since they can consent to part with you , ” said he , “ we may expect philosophy from all the world . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Miss Tilney was earnest , though gentle , in her secondary civilities , and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to Fullerton would allow .
Eleanor Tilney	Many were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney ; but so active were her thoughts , that when these inquiries were answered , she was hardly more assured than before , of Northanger Abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation , of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution , of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed , or of its standing low in a valley , sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak .
Eleanor Tilney	His brother and sister knew not what to think .
Eleanor Tilney	A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion , so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston ; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry , about an hour afterwards , came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting , and said , “ I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour .
Eleanor Tilney	As to - morrow is Sunday , Eleanor , I shall not return . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor ’s spirits always affected by Henry ’s absence !
Eleanor Tilney	His son and daughter ’s observations were of a different kind .
Eleanor Tilney	The General ’s early walk , ill - timed as it was in every other view , was favourable here ; and when she knew him to be out of the house , she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor was ready to oblige her ; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise , their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed - chamber .
Eleanor Tilney	they were not in every respect answered , for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features , hair , complexion , that should be the very counterpart , the very image , if not of Henry ’s , of Eleanor’s — the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking , bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor ’s countenance was dejected , yet sedate ; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing .
Eleanor Tilney	Again she passed through the folding doors , again her hand was upon the important lock , and Catherine , hardly able to breathe , was turning to close the former with fearful caution , when the figure , the dreaded figure of the General himself at the further end of the gallery , stood before her !
Eleanor Tilney	the name of “ Eleanor ” at the same moment , in his loudest tone
Eleanor Tilney	, resounded through the building , giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence , and to Catherine terror upon terror .
Eleanor Tilney	The breakfast - room was gay with company ; and she was named to them by the General as the friend of his daughter , in a complimentary style , which so well concealed his resentful ire , as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present .
Eleanor Tilney	And Eleanor , with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character , taking an early occasion of saying to her , “ My father only wanted me to answer a note , ” she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the General , or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so .
Eleanor Tilney	It would be much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter .
Eleanor Tilney	It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions , from which the other had , in all likelihood , been hitherto happily exempt ; nor could she therefore , in _ her _ presence , search for those proofs of the General ’s cruelty , which however they might yet have escaped discovery , she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth , in the shape of some fragmented journal , continued to the last gasp .
Eleanor Tilney	She could not be mistaken as to the room ; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!—in Miss Tilney ’s meaning , in her own calculation !
Eleanor Tilney	Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked , or the volume in which she
Eleanor Tilney	“ Mr. Tilney ! ” she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment .
Eleanor Tilney	He
Eleanor Tilney	“ Good God ! ” she continued , not attending to his address .
Eleanor Tilney	“ How came you here ?
Eleanor Tilney	How came you up that staircase ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ How came I up that staircase ! ” he replied , greatly surprised . “
Eleanor Tilney	Because it is my nearest way from the stable - yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford .
Eleanor Tilney	“ And may I not , in my turn , ” said he , as he pushed back the folding doors , “ ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . ”
Eleanor Tilney	I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . ” “ I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me .
Eleanor Tilney	I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs .
Eleanor Tilney	“ Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday — and we were coming here to these rooms — but only , ” dropping her voice , “ your father was with us . ” “ And that prevented you , ” said Henry , earnestly regarding her .
Eleanor Tilney	“ Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly . ” “ Promised so faithfully !
Eleanor Tilney	that puzzles me .
Eleanor Tilney	I have heard of a faithful performance .
Eleanor Tilney	My mother ’s room is very commodious , is it not ?
Eleanor Tilney	It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house , and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own .
Eleanor Tilney	She sent you to look at it , I suppose ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	After a short silence , during which he had closely observed her , he added , “ As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity , this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother ’s character , as described by Eleanor , which does honour to her memory .
Eleanor Tilney	The world , I believe , never saw a better woman .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor , I suppose , has talked of her a great deal ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	That is — no , not much , but what she did say was very interesting .
Eleanor Tilney	Her dying so suddenly ” ( slowly , and with hesitation it was spoken ) , “ and you — none of you being at home — and your father , I thought — perhaps had not been very fond of her . ” “ And from these circumstances , ” he replied ( his quick eye fixed on hers ) , “ you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence — some”—(involuntarily she shook her head)—“or it may be — of something still less pardonable . ”
Eleanor Tilney	She raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before .
Eleanor Tilney	“ My mother ’s illness , ” he continued , “ the seizure which ended in her death , _ was _ sudden .
Eleanor Tilney	Poor Eleanor
Eleanor Tilney	was absent , and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin .
Eleanor Tilney	He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to — we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition — and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did .
Eleanor Tilney	“ If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to — Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained .
Eleanor Tilney	This was a painful consideration whenever it occurred ; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind , she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once , propose going away , and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken .
Eleanor Tilney	Aware that if she gave herself much time , she might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject , she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone with Eleanor , and of Eleanor ’s being in the middle of a speech about something very different , to start forth her obligation of going away very soon .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned .
Eleanor Tilney	She had “ hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time — had been misled ( perhaps by her wishes ) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised — and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there , they would be too generous to hasten her return . ”
Eleanor Tilney	As long as she was happy , they would always be satisfied .
Eleanor Tilney	“ Then why , might she ask , in such a hurry herself to leave them ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Oh ! because she had been there so long . ”
Eleanor Tilney	If you think it long — ” “ Oh ! no , I do not indeed .
Eleanor Tilney	For my own pleasure , I could stay with you as long again . ”
Eleanor Tilney	The kindness , the earnestness of Eleanor ’s manner in pressing her to stay , and
Eleanor Tilney	Henry ’s gratified look on being told that her stay was determined , were such sweet proofs of her importance with them , as left her only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without .
Eleanor Tilney	She did — almost always — believe that Henry loved her , and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them ; and believing so far , her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations .
Eleanor Tilney	Henry was not able to obey his father ’s injunction of remaining wholly at Northanger in attendance on the ladies , during his absence in London , the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on Saturday for a couple of nights .
Eleanor Tilney	His loss was not now what it had been while the General was at home ; it lessened their gaiety , but did not ruin their comfort ; and the two girls agreeing in occupation , and improving in intimacy , found themselves so well sufficient for the time to themselves , that it was eleven o’clock , rather a late hour at the abbey , before they quitted the supper - room on the day of Henry ’s departure .
Eleanor Tilney	, in a “ Good heaven ! what can be the matter ? ” it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother , whose arrival was often as sudden , if not quite so unseasonable , and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him .
Eleanor Tilney	In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor , and only Eleanor , stood there .
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine ’s spirits , however , were tranquillized but for an instant , for Eleanor ’s cheeks were pale , and her manner greatly agitated .
Eleanor Tilney	, could only express her concern by silent attention , obliged her to be seated , rubbed her temples with lavender water , and hung over her with affectionate solicitude .
Eleanor Tilney	“ My dear Catherine , you must not — you must not indeed — ” were Eleanor ’s first connected words .
Eleanor Tilney	“ I am quite well .
Eleanor Tilney	This kindness distracts me — I can not bear it — I come to you on such an errand ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ How shall I tell you !
Eleanor Tilney	how shall I tell you ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	A new idea now darted into Catherine ’s mind , and turning as pale as her friend , she exclaimed , “ ’ Tis a messenger from Woodston ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ You are mistaken , indeed , ” returned Eleanor , looking at her most compassionately ; “ it is no one from Woodston .
Eleanor Tilney	It is my father himself .
Eleanor Tilney	Her voice faltered , and her eyes were turned to the ground as she mentioned his name .
Eleanor Tilney	She said nothing ; and Eleanor , endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness , but with eyes still cast down , soon went on .
Eleanor Tilney	“ You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform .
Eleanor Tilney	I am indeed a
Eleanor Tilney	After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words .
Eleanor Tilney	My dear Catherine , we are to part .
Eleanor Tilney	My father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on Monday .
Eleanor Tilney	I can not attempt either .
Eleanor Tilney	“ My dear Eleanor , ” cried Catherine , suppressing her feelings as well as she could , “ do not be so distressed .
Eleanor Tilney	” “ It will not be in my power , Catherine . ” “ Come when you can , then . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor made no answer ; and Catherine ’s thoughts recurring to something more directly interesting , she added , thinking aloud , “ Monday — so soon as Monday ; and you _ all _ go .
Eleanor Tilney	Do not be distressed , Eleanor , I can go on Monday very well .
Eleanor Tilney	But — how can I tell you?—to - morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o’clock , and no servant will be offered you . ”
Eleanor Tilney	He certainly is greatly , very greatly discomposed ; I have seldom seen him more so .
Eleanor Tilney	His temper is not happy , and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree ; some disappointment , some vexation , which just at this moment seems important , but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in , for how is it possible ?
Eleanor Tilney	It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all ; and it was only for Eleanor ’s sake that she attempted it .
Eleanor Tilney	But do not be unhappy , Eleanor .
Eleanor Tilney	An engagement , you know , must be kept .
Eleanor Tilney	“ I hope , I earnestly hope , that to your real safety it will be of none ; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence : to comfort , appearance , propriety , to your family , to the world .
Eleanor Tilney	I can be ready by seven .
Eleanor Tilney	Let me be called in time . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor saw that she wished to be alone ; and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation , now left her with , “ I shall see you in
Eleanor Tilney	In Eleanor ’s presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears , but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrents .
Eleanor Tilney	Henry at a distance — not able even to bid him farewell .
Eleanor Tilney	Every hope , every expectation from him suspended , at least , and who could say how long ?
Eleanor Tilney	And all this by such a man as General Tilney , so polite , so well bred , and heretofore so particularly fond of her !
Eleanor Tilney	The manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil , hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience , or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling ; of two days , the earliest fixed on , and of that almost the earliest hour , as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning , that he might not be obliged even to see her .
Eleanor Tilney	By some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offend him .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion , but Catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected , or , at least , not supposed to be connected with it .
Eleanor Tilney	That room , in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival , was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers .
Eleanor Tilney	Soon after six Eleanor entered her room , eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible ; but very little remained to be done .
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared .
Eleanor Tilney	But the knowledge would have been useless here ; it was not called for ; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial — Eleanor brought no message .
Eleanor Tilney	Very little passed between them on meeting ; each found her greatest safety in silence , and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs , Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress , and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk .
Eleanor Tilney	with what cheerful ease , what happy , though false , security , had she then looked around her , enjoying everything present , and fearing little in future , beyond Henry ’s going to Woodston for a day !
Eleanor Tilney	for Henry had been there ; Henry had sat by her and helped her .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech .
Eleanor Tilney	“ You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , ” she cried ; “ you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible .
Eleanor Tilney	Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour ’s comfort .
Eleanor Tilney	For _ one _ letter , at all risks , all hazards , I must entreat .
Eleanor Tilney	Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more .
Eleanor Tilney	Direct to me at Lord Longtown ’s , and , I must ask it , under
Eleanor Tilney	“ No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor only replied , “ I can not wonder at your feelings .
Eleanor Tilney	I will not importune you .
Eleanor Tilney	I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . ”
Eleanor Tilney	But this , with the look of sorrow accompanying it , was enough to melt Catherine ’s pride in a moment , and she instantly said , “ Oh , Eleanor , I _ will _ write to you indeed .
Eleanor Tilney	There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle , though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of .
Eleanor Tilney	It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home , Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey , and , upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation , it proved to be exactly the case .
Eleanor Tilney	But now — in short , she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour , went down when the clock struck five , with a broken heart , and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor ’s inquiry if she was well .
Eleanor Tilney	Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable .
Eleanor Tilney	Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater .
Eleanor Tilney	She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella ’s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James .
Eleanor Tilney	Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella .
Eleanor Tilney	But Isabella had promised and promised again ; and when she promised a thing , she was so scrupulous in performing it !
Eleanor Tilney	She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : “ Dear Catherine , “ Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me .
Eleanor Tilney	I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again .
Eleanor Tilney	I shall not enter into particulars — they would only pain you more .
Eleanor Tilney	You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God !
Eleanor Tilney	She has made me miserable forever !
Eleanor Tilney	let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; _ your _ love I do build upon .
Eleanor Tilney	I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced .
Eleanor Tilney	Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much .
Eleanor Tilney	I have written to him and my father .
Eleanor Tilney	Her duplicity hurts me more than all ; till the very last , if I reasoned with her , she declared herself as much attached to me as ever , and laughed at my fears .
Eleanor Tilney	I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it ; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved , I was that man .
Eleanor Tilney	I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney .
Eleanor Tilney	We parted at last by mutual consent — happy for me had we never met !
Eleanor Tilney	She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her .
Eleanor Tilney	She drew back , trying to beg their pardon , but was , with gentle violence , forced to return ; and the others withdrew , after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her . After half an hour ’s free indulgence of grief and reflection , Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends ; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration .
Eleanor Tilney	To expose a friend , such a friend as Isabella had been to her — and then their own brother so closely concerned in it !
Eleanor Tilney	Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast - room ; and each , as she entered it , looked at her anxiously .
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , “ No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ?
Eleanor Tilney	Mr. and Mrs. Morland — your brothers and sisters — I hope they are none of them ill ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ No , I thank you ” ( sighing as she spoke ) ; “ they are all very well .
Eleanor Tilney	you will soon know why . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor ’s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment ; but Henry began to suspect the truth , and something , in which Miss Thorpe ’s name was included , passed his lips .
Eleanor Tilney	Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours !
Eleanor Tilney	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer .
Eleanor Tilney	He gladly received the letter , and , having read it through , with close attention , returned it saying , “ Well , if it is to be so , I can only say that I am sorry for it .
Eleanor Tilney	I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Miss Tilney , at Catherine ’s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe ’s connections and fortune .
Eleanor Tilney	“ What was her father ? ” “ A lawyer , I believe .
Eleanor Tilney	I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family .
Eleanor Tilney	He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ But , ” said Eleanor , after a short pause , “ would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ?
Eleanor Tilney	When I think of his past declarations , I give him up .
Eleanor Tilney	Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe ’s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured .
Eleanor Tilney	Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . ” “ Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , ” said Eleanor with a smile .
Eleanor Tilney	I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more .
Eleanor Tilney	“ My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it .
Eleanor Tilney	You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy .
Eleanor Tilney	Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent .
Eleanor Tilney	To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought
Eleanor Tilney	On Henry ’s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother ’s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation .
Eleanor Tilney	His son and daughter ’s observations were of a different kind .
Eleanor Tilney	But now — in short , she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour , went down when the clock struck five , with a broken heart , and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor ’s inquiry if she was well .
Eleanor Tilney	Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable .

Eleanor Tilney	Mr. and Mrs. Morland — your brothers and sisters — I hope they are none of them ill ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ No , I thank you ” ( sighing as she spoke ) ; “ they are all very well .

Eleanor Tilney	I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family .
Eleanor Tilney	You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy .
Eleanor Tilney	Every mile , as it brought her nearer Woodston , added to her sufferings , and when within the distance of five , she passed the turning which led to it , and thought of Henry , so near , yet so unconscious , her grief and agitation were excessive .
Eleanor Tilney	It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage .
Eleanor Tilney	Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained ; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each .
Eleanor Tilney	Designedly , at least , Henry could not have betrayed her .
Eleanor Tilney	If , indeed , by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for , of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations , she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation .
Eleanor Tilney	If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer , she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house .
Eleanor Tilney	But a justification so full of torture to herself , she trusted , would not be in his power .
Eleanor Tilney	How Henry would think , and feel , and look , when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her being gone , was a question of force and interest to rise over every other , to be never ceasing , alternately irritating and soothing ; it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence , and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment .
Eleanor Tilney	To the General , of course , he would not dare to speak ; but to Eleanor — what might he not say to Eleanor about her ?
Eleanor Tilney	could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor ’s merit ; she felt it too strongly for expression ; and should a dislike be taken against them , should they be thought of unfavourably , on their father ’s account , it would cut her to the heart .
Eleanor Tilney	But my affair is widely different ; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and disgrace ; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness .
Eleanor Tilney	but whether such happiness were the lawful property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood .
Eleanor Tilney	Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine ’s heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible .
Eleanor Tilney	in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued , and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity , they were all seated round the tea - table , which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller , whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice , before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her .
Eleanor Tilney	Reluctantly , and with much hesitation , did she then begin what might perhaps , at the end of half an hour , be termed , by the courtesy of her hearers , an explanation ; but scarcely , within that time , could they at all discover the cause , or collect the particulars , of her sudden return .
Eleanor Tilney	here , when the whole was unfolded , was an insult not to be overlooked , nor , for the first half hour , to be easily pardoned . Without suffering any romantic alarm , in the consideration of their daughter ’s long and lonely journey , Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her ; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered ; and that , in forcing her on such a measure , General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly — neither as a gentleman nor as a parent .
Eleanor Tilney	“ I am sorry for the young people , ” returned Mrs. Morland ; “ they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General
Eleanor Tilney	As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend ’s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure .
Eleanor Tilney	The strength of these feelings , however , was far from assisting her pen ; and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor Tilney .
Eleanor Tilney	To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation , convey gratitude without servile regret , be guarded without coldness , and honest without resentment — a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of — and , above all , which she might not blush herself , if Henry should chance to see , was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance ; and , after long thought and much perplexity , to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety .
Eleanor Tilney	The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks , and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart .
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine coloured as she warmly answered , “ No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . ”
Eleanor Tilney	her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment .
Eleanor Tilney	We are sorry for him , ” said she ; “ but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ;
Eleanor Tilney	for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with , and who was so entirely without fortune ; and now , after such behaviour , we can not think at all well of her .
Eleanor Tilney	Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice .
Eleanor Tilney	A more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition ; and , after completing the fourth , she immediately added , “ Only think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was .
Eleanor Tilney	I must show it you some day or other .
Eleanor Tilney	I assure you I did not above half like coming away .
Eleanor Tilney	You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . ”
Eleanor Tilney	My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ?
Eleanor Tilney	I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since .
Eleanor Tilney	Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable .
Eleanor Tilney	I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure .
Eleanor Tilney	I remember I had my favourite gown on . ”
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I really have not patience with the General !
Eleanor Tilney	i do not suppose , Mrs. Morland , you ever saw a better - bred man in your life .
Eleanor Tilney	It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford .
Eleanor Tilney	That room , in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival , was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers .
Eleanor Tilney	Soon after six Eleanor entered her room , eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible ; but very little remained to be done .
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared .
Eleanor Tilney	But the knowledge would have been useless here ; it was not called for ; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial — Eleanor brought no message .
Eleanor Tilney	Very little passed between them on meeting ; each found her greatest safety in silence , and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs , Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress , and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk .
Eleanor Tilney	with what cheerful ease , what happy , though false , security , had she then looked around her , enjoying everything present , and fearing little in future , beyond Henry ’s going to Woodston for a day !
Eleanor Tilney	for Henry had been there ; Henry had sat by her and helped her .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech .
Eleanor Tilney	“ You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , ” she cried ; “ you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible .
Eleanor Tilney	Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour ’s comfort .
Eleanor Tilney	For _ one _ letter , at all risks , all hazards , I must entreat .
Eleanor Tilney	Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more .
Eleanor Tilney	Direct to me at Lord Longtown ’s , and , I must ask it , under
Eleanor Tilney	“ No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write .
Eleanor Tilney	Eleanor only replied , “ I can not wonder at your feelings .
Eleanor Tilney	I will not importune you .
Eleanor Tilney	I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . ”
Eleanor Tilney	But this , with the look of sorrow accompanying it , was enough to melt Catherine ’s pride in a moment , and she instantly said , “ Oh , Eleanor , I _ will _ write to you indeed .
Eleanor Tilney	They never once thought of her heart , which , for the parents of a young lady of seventeen , just returned from her first excursion from home , was odd enough !
Eleanor Tilney	As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend ’s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure .
Eleanor Tilney	There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle , though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of .
Eleanor Tilney	It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home , Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey , and , upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation , it proved to be exactly the case .
Eleanor Tilney	But whether Catherine might still expect her friends , whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture , must yet be a question .
Eleanor Tilney	they are coming for me perhaps — but I shall not go — I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I can not go , because”—looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella ’s smile—“I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk .
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother ’s arm , walking slowly down the street .
Eleanor Tilney	“ Stop , stop , Mr. Thorpe , ” she impatiently cried ; “ it is Miss Tilney ; it is indeed .
Eleanor Tilney	I must go back to Miss Tilney . ”
Eleanor Tilney	This was readily agreed to , with only a proviso of Miss Tilney ’s , that it did not rain , which Catherine was sure it would not .
Eleanor Tilney	I have a thousand things to say to you ; but make haste and get in , for I long to be off . ” Catherine followed her orders and turned away , but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to James , “ What a sweet girl she is !
Eleanor Tilney	dote on her .
Eleanor Tilney	She reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity , and was more than once on the point of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject ; but she checked herself , because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights , in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous ; and , joining to this , the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve them
Eleanor Tilney	It was ages since she had had a moment ’s conversation with her dearest Catherine ; and , though she had such thousands of things to say to her , it appeared as if they were never to be together again ; so , with smiles of most exquisite misery , and the laughing eye of utter despondency , she bade her friend adieu and went on .
Eleanor Tilney	“ Yes ; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent , and there we met Mrs. Hughes , and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her . ” “ Did you indeed ?
Eleanor Tilney	Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin ,
Eleanor Tilney	and I fancy , by what I can learn , that she always dresses very handsomely .
Eleanor Tilney	Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond , and she and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows ; and Miss Drummond had a very large fortune ; and , when she married , her father gave her twenty thousand pounds , and five hundred to buy wedding - clothes .
Eleanor Tilney	“ And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath ? ” “ Yes , I fancy they are , but I am not quite certain .
Eleanor Tilney	Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . ” “ And is Mr. Tilney , my partner , the only son ? ” “ I can not be quite positive about that , my dear ; I have some idea he is ; but , however , he is a very fine young man , Mrs. Hughes says , and likely to do very well .
Eleanor Tilney	She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour .
Eleanor Tilney	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	The marriage of Eleanor Tilney , her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry ’s banishment , to the home of her choice and the man of her choice , is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance .
Eleanor Tilney	Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin ; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her .
Eleanor Tilney	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give .
Eleanor Tilney	On the strength of this , the General , soon after Eleanor ’s marriage , permitted his son to return to Northanger , and thence made him the bearer of his consent , very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland .
Eleanor Tilney	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
Eleanor Tilney	In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged , she visited Miss Tilney , and poured
Eleanor Tilney	No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen ’s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father ’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week . Here was a blow !
Eleanor Tilney	Catherine ’s countenance fell , and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney ’s concluding words , “ By the end of another week ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I am very sorry for it , ” said Catherine dejectedly ; “ if I had known this before — ” “ Perhaps , ” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding .
Eleanor Tilney	After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , “ Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ” “ I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ” “ Well , proceed by all means .
Eleanor Tilney	Miss Tilney was earnest , though gentle , in her secondary civilities , and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to Fullerton would allow .
Eleanor Tilney	Many were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney ; but so active were her thoughts , that when these inquiries were answered , she was hardly more assured than before , of Northanger Abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation , of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution , of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed , or of its standing low in a valley , sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak .
Eleanor Tilney	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
Eleanor Tilney	When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour .
Henry Tilney	16 Catherine ’s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable ; and accordingly , though she was most politely received by General Tilney , and kindly welcomed by his daughter , though Henry was at home , and no one else of the party , she found , on her return , without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings , that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded .
Henry Tilney	, from the intercourse of the day , she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before ; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever , in the ease of a family party , he had never said so little , nor been so little agreeable ; and , in spite of their father ’s great civilities to her — in spite of his thanks , invitations , and compliments — it had been a release to get away from him .
Henry Tilney	That he was perfectly agreeable and good - natured , and altogether a very charming man , did not admit of a doubt , for he was tall and handsome , and Henry ’s father .
Henry Tilney	Miss Tilney took pains to be near her , and Henry asked her to dance .
Henry Tilney	His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior ; for , within her hearing , he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself , but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it possible .
Henry Tilney	Catherine , meanwhile , undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil , or of any evil at all , except that of having but a short set to dance down , enjoyed her usual happiness with Henry Tilney , listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said ; and , in finding him irresistible , becoming so herself .
Henry Tilney	At the end of the first dance , Captain Tilney came towards them again , and , much to Catherine ’s dissatisfaction , pulled his brother away .
Henry Tilney	They retired whispering together ; and , though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm , and lay it down as fact , that Captain Tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her , which he now hastened to communicate to his brother , in the hope of separating them forever , she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations .
Henry Tilney	Her suspense was of full five minutes ’ duration ; and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour , when they both returned , and an explanation was given , by Henry ’s requesting to know , if she thought her friend , Miss Thorpe , would have any objection to dancing , as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her .
Henry Tilney	Henry smiled , and said , “ How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people ’s actions . ” “ Why ?
Henry Tilney	What do you mean ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ I do not understand you . ” “ Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . ”
Henry Tilney	“ But pray tell me what you mean . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Shall I indeed ?
Henry Tilney	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
Henry Tilney	Catherine blushed and disclaimed , and the gentleman ’s predictions were verified .
Henry Tilney	There was a something , however , in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion ; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time , forgetting to speak or to listen , and almost forgetting where she was ; till , roused by the voice of Isabella , she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across .
Henry Tilney	James Morland ’s second letter was then received , and
Henry Tilney	the kind intentions of his father fully explained .
Henry Tilney	A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children .
Henry Tilney	, moreover , was assured as his future inheritance .
Henry Tilney	James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude ; and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry , being , however unwelcome , no more than he had expected , was borne by him without discontent .
Henry Tilney	“ Mr. Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed , ” said the gentle Mrs. Thorpe , looking anxiously at her daughter .
Henry Tilney	One could not expect more from him , you know .
Henry Tilney	“ It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life .
Henry Tilney	There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child — but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things .
Henry Tilney	Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome , you know .
Henry Tilney	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure .
Henry Tilney	James soon followed his letter , and was received with the most gratifying kindness .
Henry Tilney	Miss Tilney ’s manners and Henry ’s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings ; but still she was far from being at ease ; nor could the incessant attentions of the General himself entirely reassure her .
Henry Tilney	The remembrance of Mr. Allen ’s opinion , respecting young men ’s open carriages , made her blush at the mention of such a plan , and her first thought was to decline it ; but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney ’s judgment ; he could not propose anything improper for her ; and , in the course of a few minutes , she found herself with Henry in the curricle , as happy a being as ever existed . A very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world ; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur , to be sure , but it was a heavy and troublesome business , and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France .
Henry Tilney	; Henry drove so well — so quietly — without making any disturbance , without parading to her , or swearing at them : so different from the only gentleman - coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with !
Henry Tilney	and then his hat sat so well , and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat looked so becomingly important !
Henry Tilney	to be driven by him , next to being dancing with him , was certainly the greatest happiness in the world .
Henry Tilney	In addition to every other delight , she had now that of listening to her own praise ; of being thanked at least , on his sister ’s account , for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor ; of hearing it ranked as real friendship , and described as creating real gratitude .
Henry Tilney	His sister , he said , was uncomfortably circumstanced — she had no female companion — and , in the frequent absence of her father , was sometimes without any companion at all .
Henry Tilney	“ Are not you with her ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ Northanger is not more than half my home ; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston , which is nearly twenty miles from my father ’s , and some of my time is necessarily spent there . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I am always sorry to leave Eleanor . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Yes ; but besides your affection for her , you must be so fond of the abbey !
Henry Tilney	He smiled , and said , “ You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey . ” “ To be sure , I have .
Henry Tilney	Well , go on . ” But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther ; he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice , and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of Matilda ’s woes .
Henry Tilney	Catherine , recollecting herself , grew ashamed of her eagerness , and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related .
Henry Tilney	“ Miss Tilney , she was sure , would never put her into such a chamber as he had described !
Henry Tilney	As they drew near the end of their journey , her impatience for a sight of the abbey — for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different — returned in full force , and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone , rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks , with
Henry Tilney	A sudden scud of rain , driving full in her face , made it impossible for her to observe anything further , and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet ; and she was actually under the abbey walls , was springing , with Henry ’s assistance , from the carriage , was beneath the shelter of the old porch , and had even passed on to the hall , where her friend and the General were waiting to welcome her , without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to herself , or one moment ’s suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice .
Henry Tilney	A moment ’s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of .
Henry Tilney	Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning .
Henry Tilney	Henry ’s words , his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first , immediately rushed across her ; and though there could be nothing really in it , there was something whimsical , it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence ! She took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet .
Henry Tilney	The key was in the door , and she had a strange fancy to look into it ; not , however , with the smallest expectation of finding anything , but it was so very odd , after what Henry had said .
Henry Tilney	She seized , with an unsteady hand , the precious manuscript , for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters ; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold , resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest .
Henry Tilney	The affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father , and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe ’s information to her mind , and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on .
Henry Tilney	And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence , it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever , if not his place , by her rapidity . After sitting with them a quarter of an hour , she rose to take leave , and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney ’s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her .
Henry Tilney	What this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine ’s speculation .
Henry Tilney	Once or twice indeed , since James ’s engagement had taught her what _ could _ be done , she had got so far as to indulge in a secret “ perhaps , ” but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views : the present was now comprised in another three weeks , and her happiness being certain for that period , the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest .
Henry Tilney	with Henry at her heart , and Northanger Abbey on her lips , she hurried home to write her letter .
Henry Tilney	She was to be their chosen visitor , she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized — and , in addition to all the rest , this roof was to be the roof of an abbey !
Henry Tilney	her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney — and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill
Henry Tilney	The master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman - like young man as a partner ; his name was Tilney .
Henry Tilney	He seemed to be about four or five and twenty , was rather tall , had a pleasing countenance , a very intelligent and lively eye , and , if not quite handsome , was very near it .
Henry Tilney	His address was good , and Catherine felt herself in high luck .
Henry Tilney	There was little leisure for speaking while they danced ; but when they were seated at tea , she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being .
Henry Tilney	He talked with fluency and spirit — and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested , though it was hardly understood by her .
Henry Tilney	After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them , he suddenly addressed her with—“I have hitherto been very remiss , madam , in the proper attentions of a partner here ; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath ; whether you were ever here before ; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms , the theatre , and the concert ; and how you like the place altogether .
Henry Tilney	I have been very negligent — but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars ?
Henry Tilney	If you are I will begin directly . ” “ You need not give yourself that trouble , sir . ”
Henry Tilney	“ No trouble , I assure you , madam . ”
Henry Tilney	Then forming his features into a set smile , and affectedly softening his voice , he added , with a simpering air , “ Have you been long in Bath , madam ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ About a week , sir , ” replied Catherine , trying not to laugh .
Henry Tilney	“ Why should you be surprised , sir ? ”
Henry Tilney	” said he , in his natural tone .
Henry Tilney	“ Never , sir . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Yes , sir , I was there last Monday . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Have you been to the theatre ? ” “ Yes , sir , I was at the play on Tuesday . ” “ To the concert ? ” “ Yes , sir , on Wednesday . ” “ And are you altogether pleased with Bath ? ” “ Yes — I like it very well . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Now I must give one smirk , and then we may be rational again .
Henry Tilney	Catherine turned away her head , not knowing whether she might venture to laugh . “ I see what you think of me , ” said he gravely—“I shall make but a poor figure in your journal to - morrow . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Indeed I shall say no such thing . ” “ Shall I tell you what you ought to say ? ” “ If you please . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Perhaps you are not sitting in this room , and I am not sitting by you .
Henry Tilney	My dear madam , I am not so ignorant of young ladies ’ ways as you wish to believe me ; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated .
Henry Tilney	Nature may have done something , but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal .
Henry Tilney	“ That is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , ” said Mr. Tilney , looking at the muslin .
Henry Tilney	“ Do you understand muslins , sir ? ”
Henry Tilney	You must be a great comfort to your sister , sir . ”
Henry Tilney	“ And pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland ’s gown ? ” “ It is very pretty , madam , ” said he , gravely examining it ; “ but I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I am quite of your opinion , sir , ” replied Mrs. Allen ; “ and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Bath is a charming place , sir ; there are so many good shops here .
Henry Tilney	Whether she thought of him so much , while she drank her warm wine and water , and prepared herself for bed , as to dream of him when there , can not be ascertained ; but I hope it was no more than in a
Henry Tilney	How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen ’s head , but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied ; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was , and had been assured of Mr. Tilney ’s being a clergyman , and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire
Henry Tilney	But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella ’s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations .
Henry Tilney	And it all ended , at last , in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston , they would take him by surprise there some day or other , and eat their mutton with him .
Henry Tilney	Henry was greatly honoured and very happy , and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme .
Henry Tilney	“ And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ?
Henry Tilney	I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor ’s table .
Henry Tilney	Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come
Henry Tilney	on Monday ; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me .
Henry Tilney	I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning ; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club .
Henry Tilney	I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it .
Henry Tilney	They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year ; and I dine with them whenever I can .
Henry Tilney	But on Wednesday , I think , Henry , you may expect us ; and we shall be with you early , that we may have time to look about us .
Henry Tilney	Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston , I suppose ; we shall be in the carriage by ten ; so , about a quarter before one on Wednesday , you may look for us . ”
Henry Tilney	A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion , so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston ; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry , about an hour afterwards , came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting , and said , “ I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour .
Henry Tilney	Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday , which bad weather , or twenty other causes , may prevent , I must go away directly , two days before I intended it .
Henry Tilney	Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits , because I must go and prepare a dinner for you , to be sure . ”
Henry Tilney	Henry only smiled .
Henry Tilney	“ I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your
Henry Tilney	You must know it to be so ; and the General made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . ” “ I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own .
Henry Tilney	As to - morrow is Sunday , Eleanor , I shall not return . ”
Henry Tilney	He went ; and , it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry ’s , she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right , however disagreeable to her his going .
Henry Tilney	Who but Henry could have been aware of what his father was at ?
Henry Tilney	From Saturday to Wednesday , however , they were now to be without Henry .
Henry Tilney	This was the sad finale of every reflection : and Captain Tilney ’s letter would certainly come in his absence ; and Wednesday she was very sure would be wet .
Henry Tilney	Eleanor ’s spirits always affected by Henry ’s absence !
Henry Tilney	At the further end of the village , and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it , stood the parsonage , a new - built substantial stone house , with its semicircular sweep and green gates ; and , as they drove up to the door , Henry , with the friends of his solitude , a large Newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers , was ready to receive and make much of them .
Henry Tilney	Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits .
Henry Tilney	Henry , remember that Robinson is spoken to about it .
Henry Tilney	, however , was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations ; and , having reached the ornamental part of the premises , consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow , on which Henry ’s genius had begun to act about half a year ago , she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure - ground she had ever been in before , though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner .
Henry Tilney	His son and daughter ’s observations were of a different kind .
Henry Tilney	Her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself , she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes , till , on entering the room , the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before .
Henry Tilney	With a look of much respect , he immediately rose , and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as “ Mr. Henry Tilney , ” with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for his appearance there , acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton , and stating his impatience to be assured of Miss Morland ’s having reached her home in safety , as the cause of his intrusion .
Henry Tilney	He did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart .
Henry Tilney	Far from comprehending him or his sister in their father ’s misconduct , Mrs. Morland had been always kindly disposed towards each , and instantly , pleased by his appearance , received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence ; thanking him for such an attention to her daughter , assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there , and entreating him to say not another word of the past .
Henry Tilney	He was not ill - inclined to obey this request , for , though his heart was greatly relieved by such unlooked - for mildness , it was not just at that moment in his power to say anything to the purpose .
Henry Tilney	Returning in silence to his seat , therefore , he remained for some minutes most civilly answering all Mrs. Morland ’s common remarks about the weather and roads . Catherine meanwhile — the anxious , agitated , happy , feverish Catherine — said not a word ; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good - natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time , and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of The Mirror for a future hour .
Henry Tilney	Desirous of Mr. Morland ’s assistance , as well in giving encouragement , as in finding conversation for her guest , whose embarrassment on his father ’s account she earnestly pitied , Mrs. Morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him ; but Mr. Morland was from home — and being thus without any support , at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say .
Henry Tilney	After a couple of minutes ’ unbroken silence , Henry , turning to Catherine for the first time since her mother ’s entrance , asked her , with sudden alacrity , if Mr. and Mrs. Allen were now at Fullerton ?
Henry Tilney	And on developing , from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply , the meaning , which one short syllable would have given , immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them , and , with a rising colour , asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way .
Henry Tilney	“ You may see the house from this window , sir , ” was information on Sarah ’s side , which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman , and a silencing nod from her mother ; for Mrs. Morland , thinking it probable , as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours , that he might have some explanation to give of his father ’s behaviour , which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine , would not on any account prevent her accompanying him .
Henry Tilney	They began their walk , and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it .
Henry Tilney	Some explanation on his father ’s account he had to give ; but his first purpose was to explain himself , and before they reached
Henry Tilney	Mr. Allen ’s grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often .
Henry Tilney	She was assured of his affection ; and that heart in return was solicited , which , perhaps , they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own ;
Henry Tilney	for , though Henry was now sincerely attached to her , though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society
Henry Tilney	, I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude , or , in other words , that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought .
Henry Tilney	A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application .
Henry Tilney	On his return from Woodston , two days before , he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland ’s departure , and ordered to think of her no more .
Henry Tilney	Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand .
Henry Tilney	The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight .
Henry Tilney	Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son ; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe ’s communication , he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes .
Henry Tilney	Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this , than his own children .
Henry Tilney	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
Henry Tilney	Enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself , he set out the next day for the abbey , where his performances have been seen .
Henry Tilney	I leave it to my reader ’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine , how much of it he could have learnt from his father , in what points his own conjectures might assist him , and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James .
Henry Tilney	Henry , in having such things to relate of his father , was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself .
Henry Tilney	He blushed for the narrow - minded counsel which he was obliged to expose .
Henry Tilney	Henry ’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated , on comprehending his father ’s views , and being ordered to acquiesce in them , had been open and bold .
Henry Tilney	The General , accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family , prepared for no reluctance but of feeling , no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words , could ill brook the opposition of his son , steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it .
Henry Tilney	But , in such a cause , his anger , though it must shock , could not intimidate Henry , who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice .
Henry Tilney	He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland , and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain , no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent , no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger , could shake his fidelity , or influence the resolutions it prompted .
Henry Tilney	He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand .
Henry Tilney	Henry , in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose , had returned almost instantly to Woodston , and , on the afternoon of the following day , had begun his journey to Fullerton .
Henry Tilney	A moment ’s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of .
Henry Tilney	Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning .
Henry Tilney	Henry ’s words , his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first , immediately rushed across her ; and though there could be nothing really in it , there was something whimsical , it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence ! She took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet .
Henry Tilney	The key was in the door , and she had a strange fancy to look into it ; not , however , with the smallest expectation of finding anything , but it was so very odd , after what Henry had said .
Henry Tilney	She seized , with an unsteady hand , the precious manuscript , for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters ; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold , resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest .
Henry Tilney	It was some relief , however , that they were to return to the rooms in common use , by passing through a few of less importance , looking into the court , which , with occasional passages , not wholly unintricate , connected the different sides ; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister , having traces of cells pointed out , and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her — by finding herself successively in a billiard - room , and in the General ’s private apartment , without comprehending their connection , or being able to turn aright when she left them ; and lastly , by passing through a dark little room , owning Henry ’s authority , and strewed with his litter of books , guns , and greatcoats .
Henry Tilney	Could Henry ’s father — ? And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions !
Henry Tilney	and , when she saw him in the evening , while she worked with her friend , slowly pacing the drawing - room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness , with downcast eyes and contracted brow , she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him .
Henry Tilney	Unhappy man !
Henry Tilney	and the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly , as to catch Miss Tilney ’s notice .
Henry Tilney	“ So much the worse ! ” thought Catherine ; such ill - timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks , and boded nothing good .
Henry Tilney	After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry ’s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell .
Henry Tilney	When the butler would have lit his master ’s candle , however , he was
Henry Tilney	If Henry had been with them indeed !
Henry Tilney	She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ”
Henry Tilney	“ To be sure you must miss him very much . ”
Henry Tilney	31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start .
Henry Tilney	His pleasing manners and good sense were self - evident recommendations ; and having never heard evil of him , it was not their way to suppose any evil could
Henry Tilney	Goodwill supplying the place of experience , his character needed no attestation .
Henry Tilney	while his parent so expressly forbade the connection , they could not allow themselves to encourage it . That the General should come forward to solicit the alliance , or that he should even very heartily approve it , they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation ; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded , and that once obtained — and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied — their willing approbation was instantly to follow .
Henry Tilney	Henry returned to what was now his only home , to watch over his young plantations , and extend his improvements for her sake , to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward ; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry .
Henry Tilney	The anxiety , which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine , and of all who loved either , as to its final event , can hardly extend , I fear , to the bosom of my readers , who will see in the tell - tale compression of the pages before them , that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity .
Henry Tilney	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ”
Henry Tilney	The marriage of Eleanor Tilney , her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry ’s banishment , to the home of her choice and the man of her choice , is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance .
Henry Tilney	The event which it authorized soon followed : Henry and Catherine were married , the bells rang , and everybody smiled ; and , as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting
Henry Tilney	On Henry ’s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother ’s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation .
Henry Tilney	“ It will soon be as if you never had , ” said Henry .
Henry Tilney	“ There is but one thing that I can not understand .
Henry Tilney	I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time .
Henry Tilney	Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ?
Henry Tilney	“ Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ?
Henry Tilney	“ I am persuaded that he never did . ” “ And only made believe to do so for mischief ’s sake ? ” Henry bowed his assent .
Henry Tilney	“ But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose — consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . ” “ It is very right that you should stand by your brother . ”
Henry Tilney	“ And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe .
Henry Tilney	But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . ” Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness .
Henry Tilney	Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty , while Henry made himself so agreeable .
Henry Tilney	they were not in every respect answered , for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features , hair , complexion , that should be the very counterpart , the very image , if not of Henry ’s , of Eleanor’s — the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking , bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child .
Henry Tilney	Of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress ; and as she wished to get it over before Henry ’s return , who was expected on the morrow , there was no time to be lost .
Henry Tilney	With a feeling of terror not very definable , she fixed her eyes on the staircase , and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view .
Henry Tilney	she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday — and we were coming here to these rooms — but only , ” dropping her voice , “ your father was with us . ” “ And that prevented you , ” said Henry , earnestly regarding her .
Henry Tilney	“ It is only a quarter past four , ” showing his watch ; “ and you are not now in Bath .
Henry Tilney	She could not contradict it , and therefore suffered herself to be detained , though her dread of further questions made her , for the first time in their acquaintance , wish to leave him .
Henry Tilney	Henry ’s address , short as it had been , had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done .
Henry Tilney	It was not only with herself that she was sunk — but with Henry .
Henry Tilney	Her folly , which now seemed even criminal , was all exposed to him , and he must despise her forever .
Henry Tilney	The liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father — could he ever forgive it ?
Henry Tilney	He had — she thought he had , once or twice before this fatal morning , shown something like affection for her .
Henry Tilney	The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room , and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual .
Henry Tilney	Catherine had never wanted comfort more , and he looked as if he was aware of it .
Henry Tilney	She did not learn either to forget or defend the past ; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther , and that it might not cost her Henry ’s entire regard .
Henry Tilney	Upon this conviction , she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney , some slight imperfection might hereafter appear ; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father , who , though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained , she did believe , upon serious consideration , to be not perfectly amiable .
Henry Tilney	Henry ’s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct , in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed , was of the greatest assistance to her ; and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress , her spirits became absolutely comfortable , and capable , as heretofore , of continual improvement by anything he said .
Henry Tilney	For nine successive mornings , Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment , which each morning became more severe : but , on the tenth , when she entered the breakfast - room , her first object was a letter , held out by Henry ’s willing hand .
Henry Tilney	She thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself .
Henry Tilney	“ Believe me , ” & c. Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began .
Henry Tilney	He was prevented , however , from even looking his surprise by his father ’s entrance .
Henry Tilney	She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her .
Henry Tilney	Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast - room ; and each , as she entered it , looked at her anxiously .
Henry Tilney	“ I am sorry , ” said Henry , closing the book he had just opened ; “ if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . ”
Henry Tilney	“ To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , ” replied Henry warmly , “ must be a comfort to him under any distress . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I have one favour to beg , ” said Catherine , shortly afterwards , in an agitated manner , “ that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . ”
Henry Tilney	Eleanor ’s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment ; but Henry began to suspect the truth , and something , in which Miss Thorpe ’s name was included , passed his lips .
Henry Tilney	“ How quick you are ! ” cried Catherine : “ you have guessed it , I declare !
Henry Tilney	And yet , when we talked about it in Bath , you little thought of its ending so .
Henry Tilney	could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ” “ I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed .
Henry Tilney	The brother and sister looked at each other .
Henry Tilney	is not it inconceivable , Henry ?
Henry Tilney	Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . ” “ Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , ” said Eleanor with a smile .
Henry Tilney	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ” replied Henry ; “ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance .
Henry Tilney	I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . ” “ You think it is all for ambition , then ?
Henry Tilney	My dearest Catherine ,
Henry Tilney	I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight , and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner .
Henry Tilney	I
Henry Tilney	really am quite ashamed of my idleness ; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing .
Henry Tilney	I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath , but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other .
Henry Tilney	Pray write to me soon , and direct to my own home .
Henry Tilney	Since you went away , I have had no pleasure in it — the dust is beyond anything ; and everybody one cares for is gone .
Henry Tilney	I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive .
Henry Tilney	I am quite uneasy about your dear brother , not having heard from him since he went to Oxford ; and am fearful of some misunderstanding .
Henry Tilney	Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it .
Henry Tilney	I hope you spend your time pleasantly , but am afraid you never think of me .
Henry Tilney	I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together .
Henry Tilney	I rejoice to say that the young man whom , of all others , I particularly abhor , has left Bath .
Henry Tilney	You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away .
Henry Tilney	Afterwards he got worse , and became quite my shadow .
Henry Tilney	Many girls might have been taken in , for never were such attentions ; but I knew the fickle sex too well .
Henry Tilney	He went away to his regiment two days ago , and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again .
Henry Tilney	He is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw , and amazingly disagreeable .
Henry Tilney	The last two days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis : I pitied his taste , but took no notice of him .
Henry Tilney	The last time we met was in Bath Street , and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me ; I would not even look at him .
Henry Tilney	He went into the pump - room afterwards ; but I would not have followed him for all the world .
Henry Tilney	pray send me some news of the latter — I am quite unhappy about him ; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away , with a cold , or something that affected his spirits .
Henry Tilney	I would write to him myself , but have mislaid his direction ; and , as I hinted above , am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss .
Henry Tilney	Pray explain everything to his satisfaction ; or , if he still harbours any doubt , a line from himself to me , or a call at Putney when next in town , might set all to rights .
Henry Tilney	I have not been to the Rooms this age , nor to the play , except going in last night with the Hodges , for a frolic , at half price :
Henry Tilney	they teased me into it ; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone .
Henry Tilney	We happened to sit by the Mitchells , and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out .
Henry Tilney	I knew their spite : at one time they could not be civil to me , but now they are all friendship ; but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them .
Henry Tilney	You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own .
Henry Tilney	Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it — it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take .
Henry Tilney	I wear nothing but purple now : I know I look hideous in it , but no matter — it is your dear brother ’s favourite colour .
Henry Tilney	Lose no time , my dearest , sweetest Catherine , in writing to him and to me , Who ever am , etc . Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine .
Henry Tilney	“ Write to James on her behalf !
Henry Tilney	no , James should never hear Isabella ’s name mentioned by her again . ”
Henry Tilney	On Henry ’s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother ’s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation .
Henry Tilney	I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her .
Henry Tilney	“ It will soon be as if you never had , ” said Henry .
Henry Tilney	“ There is but one thing that I can not understand .
Henry Tilney	I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time .
Henry Tilney	Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ?
Henry Tilney	“ Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ?
Henry Tilney	“ I am persuaded that he never did . ” “ And only made believe to do so for mischief ’s sake ? ” Henry bowed his assent .
Henry Tilney	Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty , while Henry made himself so agreeable .
Henry Tilney	At the further end of the village , and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it , stood the parsonage , a new - built substantial stone house , with its semicircular sweep and green gates ; and , as they drove up to the door , Henry , with the friends of his solitude , a large Newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers , was ready to receive and make much of them .
Henry Tilney	Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits .
Henry Tilney	Henry , remember that Robinson is spoken to about it .
Henry Tilney	, however , was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations ; and , having reached the ornamental part of the premises , consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow , on which Henry ’s genius had begun to act about half a year ago , she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure - ground she had ever been in before , though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner .
Henry Tilney	His son and daughter ’s observations were of a different kind .
Henry Tilney	Every mile , as it brought her nearer Woodston , added to her sufferings , and when within the distance of five , she passed the turning which led to it , and thought of Henry , so near , yet so unconscious , her grief and agitation were excessive .
Henry Tilney	It was there , it was on that day , that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself , had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage .
Henry Tilney	Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained ; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each .
Henry Tilney	Designedly , at least , Henry could not have betrayed her .
Henry Tilney	If , indeed , by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for , of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations , she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation .
Henry Tilney	How Henry would think , and feel , and look , when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her being gone , was a question of force and interest to rise over every other , to be never ceasing , alternately irritating and soothing ; it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence , and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment .
Henry Tilney	could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor ’s merit ; she felt it too strongly for expression ; and should a dislike be taken against them , should they be thought of unfavourably , on their father ’s account , it would cut her to the heart .
Henry Tilney	To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation , convey gratitude without servile regret , be guarded without coldness , and honest without resentment — a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of — and , above all , which she might not blush herself , if Henry should chance to see , was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance ; and , after long thought and much perplexity , to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety .
Henry Tilney	her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment .
Henry Tilney	We are sorry for him , ” said she ; “ but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ;
Henry Tilney	for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with , and who was so entirely without fortune ; and now , after such behaviour , we can not think at all well of her .
Henry Tilney	Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice .
Henry Tilney	It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford .
Henry Tilney	Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening , in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe , though they certainly claimed much of her leisure , as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach ; but she looked in vain .
Henry Tilney	Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump - room .
Henry Tilney	Henry ’s address , short as it had been , had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done .
Henry Tilney	It was not only with herself that she was sunk — but with Henry .
Henry Tilney	Her folly , which now seemed even criminal , was all exposed to him , and he must despise her forever .

Henry Tilney	The brother and sister looked at each other .
Henry Tilney	She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so .
Henry Tilney	is not it inconceivable , Henry ?
Henry Tilney	Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . ” “ Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , ” said Eleanor with a smile .
Henry Tilney	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ” replied Henry ; “ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance .
Henry Tilney	I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . ” “ You think it is all for ambition , then ?
Henry Tilney	And , upon my word , there are some things that seem very like it .
Henry Tilney	I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more .
Henry Tilney	I never was so deceived in anyone ’s character in my life before . ”
Henry Tilney	She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement .
Henry Tilney	“ My brother does know it , ” was Henry ’s answer .
Henry Tilney	He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , “ Why do not you persuade him to go away ?
Henry Tilney	Henry smiled and said , “ I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . ”
Henry Tilney	“ My dear Miss Morland , ” said Henry , “ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ?
Henry Tilney	I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can .
Henry Tilney	Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “ Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us .
Henry Tilney	Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart ; but that at such a moment was allowable ; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction , and once she drew back her hand ; but Catherine remembered Henry ’s instructions , and placed it all to judicious affection .
Henry Tilney	Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly !
Henry Tilney	and it was in a great measure his own doing , for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures , she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it .
Henry Tilney	Henry was alone in it ; and his immediate
Henry Tilney	Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston , where business required and would keep him two or three days .
Henry Tilney	They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse , and immediately on re - entering the breakfast - room , Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure .
Henry Tilney	“ This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother ’s fortitude , ” observed the General to Eleanor .
Henry Tilney	The house stands among fine meadows facing the south - east , with an excellent kitchen - garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son .
Henry Tilney	Did Henry ’s income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill - provided for .
Henry Tilney	Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business .
Henry Tilney	If Henry had been with them indeed !
Henry Tilney	She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ”
Henry Tilney	“ To be sure you must miss him very much . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Isabella , my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare !
Henry Tilney	You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme ; it darted into our heads at breakfast - time , I verily believe at the same instant ; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for
Henry Tilney	Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother ’s arm , walking slowly down the street .
Henry Tilney	“ If your brother had not got such a d — — beast to drive , ” said he soon afterwards , “ we might have done it very well .
Henry Tilney	At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , “ I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back .
Henry Tilney	“ Yes , I went to the pump - room as soon as you were gone , and there I met her , and we had a great deal of talk together .
Henry Tilney	Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . ” “ And is Mr. Tilney , my partner , the only son ? ” “ I can not be quite positive about that , my dear ; I have some idea he is ; but , however , he is a very fine young man , Mrs. Hughes says , and likely to do very well .
Henry Tilney	It was some relief , however , that they were to return to the rooms in common use , by passing through a few of less importance , looking into the court , which , with occasional passages , not wholly unintricate , connected the different sides ; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister , having traces of cells pointed out , and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her — by finding herself successively in a billiard - room , and in the General ’s private apartment , without comprehending their connection , or being able to turn aright when she left them ; and lastly , by passing through a dark little room , owning Henry ’s authority , and strewed with his litter of books , guns , and greatcoats .
Henry Tilney	Could Henry ’s father — ? And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions !
Henry Tilney	After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry ’s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell .
Henry Tilney	When the butler would have lit his master ’s candle , however , he was
Henry Tilney	His pleasing manners and good sense were self - evident recommendations ; and having never heard evil of him , it was not their way to suppose any evil could
Henry Tilney	Goodwill supplying the place of experience , his character needed no attestation .
Henry Tilney	while his parent so expressly forbade the connection , they could not allow themselves to encourage it . That the General should come forward to solicit the alliance , or that he should even very heartily approve it , they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation ; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded , and that once obtained — and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied — their willing approbation was instantly to follow .
Henry Tilney	Of a very considerable fortune , his son was , by marriage settlements , eventually secure ; his present income was an income of independence and comfort , and under every pecuniary view , it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter .
Henry Tilney	Henry returned to what was now his only home , to watch over his young plantations , and extend his improvements for her sake , to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward ; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry .
Henry Tilney	The anxiety , which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine , and of all who loved either , as to its final event , can hardly extend , I fear , to the bosom of my readers , who will see in the tell - tale compression of the pages before them , that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity .
Henry Tilney	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ”
Henry Tilney	The marriage of Eleanor Tilney , her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry ’s banishment , to the home of her choice and the man of her choice , is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance .
Henry Tilney	Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin ; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her .
Henry Tilney	His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “ Your Ladyship ! ”
Henry Tilney	Her husband was really deserving of her ; independent of his peerage , his wealth , and his attachment , being to a precision the most charming young man in the world .
Henry Tilney	Any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary ; the most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination of us all .
Henry Tilney	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give .
Henry Tilney	It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe ’s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it ; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor , and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds . This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride ; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence , which he was at some pains to procure , that the Fullerton estate , being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor , was consequently open to every greedy speculation .
Henry Tilney	On the strength of this , the General , soon after Eleanor ’s marriage , permitted his son to return to Northanger , and thence made him the bearer of his consent , very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland .
Henry Tilney	The event which it authorized soon followed : Henry and Catherine were married , the bells rang , and everybody smiled ; and , as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting
Henry Tilney	for , though Henry was now sincerely attached to her , though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society
Henry Tilney	, I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude , or , in other words , that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought .
Henry Tilney	A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application .
Henry Tilney	On his return from Woodston , two days before , he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland ’s departure , and ordered to think of her no more .
Henry Tilney	Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand .
Henry Tilney	The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight .
Henry Tilney	Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son ; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe ’s communication , he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes .
Henry Tilney	Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this , than his own children .
Henry Tilney	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
Henry Tilney	Enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself , he set out the next day for the abbey , where his performances have been seen .
Henry Tilney	I leave it to my reader ’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine , how much of it he could have learnt from his father , in what points his own conjectures might assist him , and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James .
Henry Tilney	Henry , in having such things to relate of his father , was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself .
Henry Tilney	He blushed for the narrow - minded counsel which he was obliged to expose .
Henry Tilney	Henry ’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated , on comprehending his father ’s views , and being ordered to acquiesce in them , had been open and bold .
Henry Tilney	The General , accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family , prepared for no reluctance but of feeling , no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words , could ill brook the opposition of his son , steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it .
Henry Tilney	But , in such a cause , his anger , though it must shock , could not intimidate Henry , who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice .
Henry Tilney	He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland , and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain , no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent , no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger , could shake his fidelity , or influence the resolutions it prompted .
Henry Tilney	He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand .
Henry Tilney	Henry , in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose , had returned almost instantly to Woodston , and , on the afternoon of the following day , had begun his journey to Fullerton .
Henry Tilney	What this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine ’s speculation .
Henry Tilney	Once or twice indeed , since James ’s engagement had taught her what _ could _ be done , she had got so far as to indulge in a secret “ perhaps , ” but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views : the present was now comprised in another three weeks , and her happiness being certain for that period , the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest .
Henry Tilney	with Henry at her heart , and Northanger Abbey on her lips , she hurried home to write her letter .
Henry Tilney	She was to be their chosen visitor , she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized — and , in addition to all the rest , this roof was to be the roof of an abbey !
Henry Tilney	her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney — and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill
Henry Tilney	“ But pray tell me what you mean . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Shall I indeed ?
Henry Tilney	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
Henry Tilney	Catherine blushed and disclaimed , and the gentleman ’s predictions were verified .
Henry Tilney	There was a something , however , in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion ; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time , forgetting to speak or to listen , and almost forgetting where she was ; till , roused by the voice of Isabella , she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across .
Henry Tilney	James Morland ’s second letter was then received , and
Henry Tilney	the kind intentions of his father fully explained .
Henry Tilney	A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children .
Henry Tilney	, moreover , was assured as his future inheritance .
Henry Tilney	James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude ; and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry , being , however unwelcome , no more than he had expected , was borne by him without discontent .
Henry Tilney	“ Mr. Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed , ” said the gentle Mrs. Thorpe , looking anxiously at her daughter .
Henry Tilney	One could not expect more from him , you know .
Henry Tilney	“ It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life .
Henry Tilney	There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child — but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things .
Henry Tilney	Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome , you know .
Henry Tilney	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure .
Henry Tilney	James soon followed his letter , and was received with the most gratifying kindness .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella , on hearing the particulars of the visit , gave a different explanation : “ It was all pride , pride , insufferable haughtiness and pride !
Isabella Thorpe	“ But it was not so bad as that , Isabella ; there was no superciliousness ; she was very civil . ”
Isabella Thorpe	” Isabella ’s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend ; she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister ; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts .
Isabella Thorpe	The evening rewarded her confidence ; she was met by one with the same kindness , and by the other with the same attention , as heretofore :
Isabella Thorpe	Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother , Captain Tilney , was expected almost every hour , she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable - looking , handsome young man , whom she had never seen before , and who now evidently belonged to their party .
Isabella Thorpe	She looked at him with great admiration , and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother , though , in her eyes , his air was more assuming , and his countenance less prepossessing .
Isabella Thorpe	His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior ; for , within her hearing , he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself , but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it possible .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Your brother will not mind it , I know , ” said she , “ because I heard him say before that he hated dancing ; but it was very good - natured in him to think of it .
Isabella Thorpe	I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down , and fancied she might wish for a partner ; but he is quite mistaken , for she would not dance upon any account in the world .
Isabella Thorpe	There was a something , however , in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion ; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time , forgetting to speak or to listen , and almost forgetting where she was ; till , roused by the voice of Isabella , she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled , the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given ; but as it was not quite enough for Catherine ’s comprehension , she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I can not think how it could happen !
Isabella Thorpe	“ And did Isabella never change her mind before ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ” “ I can not take surprise to myself on that head .
Isabella Thorpe	You bid me be surprised on your friend ’s account , and therefore I am ; but
Isabella Thorpe	as for my brother , his conduct in the business , I must own , has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to .
Isabella Thorpe	The fairness of your friend was an open attraction ; her firmness , you know , could only be understood by yourself . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . ”
Isabella Thorpe	When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour .
Isabella Thorpe	The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle !
Isabella Thorpe	amusing enough , if my mind had been disengaged ; but I would have given the world to sit still . ” “ Then why did not you ? ” “ Oh !
Isabella Thorpe	my
Isabella Thorpe	it would have looked so particular ; and you know how I abhor doing that .
Isabella Thorpe	I refused him as long as I possibly could , but he would take no denial .
Isabella Thorpe	You have no idea how he pressed me .
Isabella Thorpe	I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner — but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me .
Isabella Thorpe	i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so — and so then I found there would be no peace
Isabella Thorpe	if I did not stand up .
Isabella Thorpe	Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening .
Isabella Thorpe	I am so glad it is over !
Isabella Thorpe	my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense : and then , being such a smart young fellow , I saw every eye was upon us .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled .
Isabella Thorpe	“ It is very charming indeed , ” said Isabella , with a grave face .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Mr. Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed , ” said the gentle Mrs. Thorpe , looking anxiously at her daughter .
Isabella Thorpe	One could not expect more from him , you know .
Isabella Thorpe	Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed , but your wishes , my dear Isabella , are so moderate , you do not consider how little you ever want , my dear . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life .
Isabella Thorpe	For myself , it is nothing ; I never think of myself . ” “ I know you never do , my dear ; and you will always find your reward in
Isabella Thorpe	Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome , you know .
Isabella Thorpe	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure .
Isabella Thorpe	But everybody has their failing , you know , and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella recollected herself .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , yes , my darling Isabella , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , “ we perfectly see into your heart .
Isabella Thorpe	You have no disguise .
Isabella Thorpe	We perfectly understand the present vexation ; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection . ”
Isabella Thorpe	She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella ’s regret ; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever , endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise .
Isabella Thorpe	15 Early the next day , a note from Isabella , speaking peace and tenderness in every line , and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance , hastened Catherine , in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity , to Edgar ’s Buildings .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step , and a look of such happy importance , as engaged all her friend ’s notice .
Isabella Thorpe	Maria was without ceremony sent away , and Isabella , embracing Catherine , thus began : “ Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you .
Isabella Thorpe	my dear Isabella , what do you mean ?
Isabella Thorpe	Can you — can you really be in love with James ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	The anxious affection , which she was accused of having continually watched in Isabella ’s every look and action , had , in the course of their yesterday ’s party , received the delightful confession of an equal love .
Isabella Thorpe	Her brother and her friend engaged !
Isabella Thorpe	Delighting , however , as Catherine sincerely did , in the prospect of the connection , it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations .
Isabella Thorpe	“ You are so like your dear brother , ” continued Isabella , “ that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer ; but ashamed of an ignorance little expected , she dared no longer contest the point , nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her .
Isabella Thorpe	Her brother , she found , was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton , to make known his situation and ask consent ; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine endeavoured to persuade her , as she was herself persuaded , that her father and mother would never oppose their son ’s wishes .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Morland says exactly the same , ” replied Isabella ; “ and yet I dare not expect it ; my fortune will be so small ; they never can consent to it .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Indeed , Isabella , you are too humble .
Isabella Thorpe	my sweet Catherine , in _ your _ generous heart I know it would signify nothing ; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many .
Isabella Thorpe	Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . ” This charming sentiment , recommended as much by sense as novelty , gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance ; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea .
Isabella Thorpe	I am sure they will consent , ” was her frequent declaration ; “ I am sure they will be delighted with you . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ For my own part , ” said Isabella , “ my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me .
Isabella Thorpe	Where people are really attached , poverty itself is wealth ; grandeur I detest : I would not settle in London for the universe .
Isabella Thorpe	“ You must settle near Fullerton .
Isabella Thorpe	You must be near us . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not .
Isabella Thorpe	If I can but be near _ you _ , I shall be satisfied .
Isabella Thorpe	i will not allow myself to think of such things , till we have your father ’s answer .
Isabella Thorpe	I know I shall never have courage to open the letter .
Isabella Thorpe	I know it will be the death of me . ”
Isabella Thorpe	A reverie succeeded this conviction — and when Isabella spoke again , it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding - gown .
Isabella Thorpe	Mrs. Thorpe and her son , who were acquainted with everything , and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland ’s consent , to consider Isabella ’s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family , were allowed to join their counsels , and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine was with her friend again the next day , endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters ; a needful exertion , for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near , Isabella became more and more desponding , and before the letter arrived , had worked herself into a state of real distress .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents , and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness , ” were the first three lines , and in one moment all was joyful security .
Isabella Thorpe	The brightest glow was instantly spread over Isabella ’s features , all care and anxiety seemed removed , her spirits became almost too high for control , and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals .
Isabella Thorpe	Mrs. Thorpe , with tears of joy , embraced her daughter , her son , her visitor , and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction .
Isabella Thorpe	It was “ dear John ” and “ dear Catherine ” at every word ; “ dear Anne and dear Maria ” must immediately be made sharers in their felicity ; and two “ dears ” at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned
Isabella Thorpe	But for particulars Isabella could well afford to wait .
Isabella Thorpe	Did you ever hear the old song , ‘ Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? ’
Isabella Thorpe	“ But I say , Miss Morland , I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long , if not disagreeable . ” “ Pray do .
Isabella Thorpe	had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother ’s arrival ; and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people ’s happiness , with a remark , on the gentleman ’s side , in favour of Isabella ’s beauty , and on the lady ’s , of her great good luck .
Isabella Thorpe	In a private consultation between Isabella and James , the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going , and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her , it was agreed that , provided the weather were fair , the party should take place on the following morning ; and they were to set off very early , in order to be at home in good time .
Isabella Thorpe	In that interval the plan was completed , and as soon as she came again , her agreement was demanded ; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella , Catherine looked grave , was very sorry , but could not go .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Do not urge me , Isabella .
Isabella Thorpe	But Isabella became only more and more urgent , calling on her in the most affectionate manner , addressing her by the most endearing names .
Isabella Thorpe	She was sure her dearest , sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly .
Isabella Thorpe	She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart , so sweet a temper , to be so easily persuaded by those she loved .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella then tried another method .
Isabella Thorpe	She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney , though she had known her so little a while , than for her best and oldest friends , with being grown cold and indifferent , in short , towards herself .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I can not help being jealous , Catherine , when I see myself slighted for strangers , I , who love you so excessively !
Isabella Thorpe	when once my affections are placed , it is not in the power of anything to change them .
Isabella Thorpe	But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody ’s ; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace ; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick , I own .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish , regardless of everything but her own gratification .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella , in the meanwhile , had applied her handkerchief to her eyes ; and Morland , miserable at such a sight , could not help saying , “ Nay , Catherine .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine was sorry , but could do no more ; and a short silence ensued , which was broken by Isabella , who in a voice of cold resentment said , “ Very well , then there is an end of the party .
Isabella Thorpe	If Catherine does not go , I can not .
Isabella Thorpe	I can not be the only woman .
Isabella Thorpe	I would not , upon any account in the world , do so improper a thing . ”
Isabella Thorpe	The three others still continued together , walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine ; sometimes not a word was said , sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches , and her arm was still linked within Isabella ’s , though their hearts were at war .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I suspect , ” said Isabella , in a low voice , “ there is no great struggle . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine ’s heart swelled ; she drew away her arm , and Isabella made no opposition .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella ’s countenance was once more all smiles and good humour , and James too looked happy again .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella , however , caught hold of one hand , Thorpe of the other , and remonstrances poured in from all three .
Isabella Thorpe	Let me go , Mr. Thorpe ; Isabella , do not hold me . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine , relieved for herself , felt uneasy for Isabella , and after a moment ’s thought , asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe , and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself ; for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day , in spite of what had passed .
Isabella Thorpe	“ You had better leave her alone , my dear ; she is old enough to know what she is about , and if not , has a mother to advise her .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine submitted , and though sorry to think that Isabella should be doing wrong , felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen ’s approbation of her own conduct , and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself .
Isabella Thorpe	From this time , the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people ; and Catherine found , with some surprise , that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella ’s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother .
Isabella Thorpe	Their persuasion that the General would , upon this ground alone , independent of the objection that might be raised against her character , oppose the connection , turned her
Isabella Thorpe	She was as insignificant , and perhaps as portionless , as Isabella ; and if the heir of the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself , at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest ?
Isabella Thorpe	But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella ’s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations .
Isabella Thorpe	Her brother so unhappy , and her loss in Isabella so great ; and
Isabella Thorpe	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
Isabella Thorpe	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light .
Isabella Thorpe	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
Isabella Thorpe	27 The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella : _ Bath , April _
Isabella Thorpe	My dearest Catherine ,
Isabella Thorpe	I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight , and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner .
Isabella Thorpe	I
Isabella Thorpe	really am quite ashamed of my idleness ; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing .
Isabella Thorpe	I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath , but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other .
Isabella Thorpe	Pray write to me soon , and direct to my own home .
Isabella Thorpe	Since you went away , I have had no pleasure in it — the dust is beyond anything ; and everybody one cares for is gone .
Isabella Thorpe	I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive .
Isabella Thorpe	I am quite uneasy about your dear brother , not having heard from him since he went to Oxford ; and am fearful of some misunderstanding .
Isabella Thorpe	Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it .
Isabella Thorpe	I hope you spend your time pleasantly , but am afraid you never think of me .
Isabella Thorpe	I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together .
Isabella Thorpe	I rejoice to say that the young man whom , of all others , I particularly abhor , has left Bath .
Isabella Thorpe	You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away .
Isabella Thorpe	Afterwards he got worse , and became quite my shadow .
Isabella Thorpe	Many girls might have been taken in , for never were such attentions ; but I knew the fickle sex too well .
Isabella Thorpe	He went away to his regiment two days ago , and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again .
Isabella Thorpe	He is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw , and amazingly disagreeable .
Isabella Thorpe	The last two days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis : I pitied his taste , but took no notice of him .
Isabella Thorpe	The last time we met was in Bath Street , and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me ; I would not even look at him .
Isabella Thorpe	He went into the pump - room afterwards ; but I would not have followed him for all the world .
Isabella Thorpe	pray send me some news of the latter — I am quite unhappy about him ; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away , with a cold , or something that affected his spirits .
Isabella Thorpe	I would write to him myself , but have mislaid his direction ; and , as I hinted above , am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss .
Isabella Thorpe	Pray explain everything to his satisfaction ; or , if he still harbours any doubt , a line from himself to me , or a call at Putney when next in town , might set all to rights .
Isabella Thorpe	I have not been to the Rooms this age , nor to the play , except going in last night with the Hodges , for a frolic , at half price :
Isabella Thorpe	they teased me into it ; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone .
Isabella Thorpe	We happened to sit by the Mitchells , and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out .
Isabella Thorpe	I knew their spite : at one time they could not be civil to me , but now they are all friendship ; but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them .
Isabella Thorpe	You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own .
Isabella Thorpe	Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it — it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take .
Isabella Thorpe	I wear nothing but purple now : I know I look hideous in it , but no matter — it is your dear brother ’s favourite colour .
Isabella Thorpe	Lose no time , my dearest , sweetest Catherine , in writing to him and to me , Who ever am , etc . Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine .
Isabella Thorpe	She was ashamed of Isabella , and ashamed of having ever loved her .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Write to James on her behalf !
Isabella Thorpe	no , James should never hear Isabella ’s name mentioned by her again . ”
Isabella Thorpe	When she had finished it—“So much for Isabella , ” she cried , “ and for all our intimacy !
Isabella Thorpe	she must think me an idiot , or she could not have written so ; but perhaps this has served to make
Isabella Thorpe	her
Isabella Thorpe	character better known to me than mine is to her
Isabella Thorpe	I see what she has been about .
Isabella Thorpe	She is a vain coquette , and her tricks have not answered .
Isabella Thorpe	I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her .
Isabella Thorpe	I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time .
Isabella Thorpe	Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ?
Isabella Thorpe	“ I have very little to say for Frederick ’s motives , such as I believe them to have been .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ?
Isabella Thorpe	“ I am persuaded that he never did . ” “ And only made believe to do so for mischief ’s sake ? ” Henry bowed his assent .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Well , then , I must say that I do not like him at all .
Isabella Thorpe	Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all .
Isabella Thorpe	As it happens , there is no great harm done , because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose .
Isabella Thorpe	But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose — consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . ” “ It is very right that you should stand by your brother . ”
Isabella Thorpe	She resolved on not answering Isabella ’s letter , and tried to think no more of it .
Isabella Thorpe	He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself .
Isabella Thorpe	“ And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe .
Isabella Thorpe	This evil had been felt and lamented , at least three times a day , by Isabella since her residence in Bath ; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more , for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage , and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds , and threading the gutters of that interesting alley , they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig , driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing - looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself , his companion , and his horse .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Oh , these odious gigs ! ” said Isabella , looking up .
Isabella Thorpe	“ How I detest them . ”
Isabella Thorpe	she looked again and exclaimed , “ Delightful !
Isabella Thorpe	mr . Morland and my brother ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people ’s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself .
Isabella Thorpe	John Thorpe , who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses , soon joined them , and from him she directly received the amends which were her due ; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella , on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow .
Isabella Thorpe	“ _ Three_-and - twenty ! ” cried Thorpe , “ five - and - twenty if it is an inch . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Morland remonstrated , pleaded the authority of road - books , innkeepers , and milestones ; but his friend disregarded them all ; he had a surer test of distance .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I know it must be five - and - twenty , ” said he , “ by the time we have been doing it .
Isabella Thorpe	It is now half after one ; we drove out of the inn - yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven ; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness ; that makes it exactly twenty - five . ” “ You have lost an hour , ” said Morland ; “ it was only ten o’clock when we came from Tetbury . ” “ Ten o’clock !
Isabella Thorpe	it was eleven , upon my soul !
Isabella Thorpe	i counted every stroke .
Isabella Thorpe	This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses , Miss Morland ; do but look at my horse ; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	What do you think of my gig , Miss Morland ?
Isabella Thorpe	Well hung ; town - built ; I have not had it a month .
Isabella Thorpe	It was built for a Christchurch man , a friend of mine , a very good sort of fellow ; he ran it a few weeks , till , I believe , it was convenient to have done with it .
Isabella Thorpe	I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind , though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too ; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge , as he was driving into Oxford , last term : ‘ Ah !
Isabella Thorpe	‘ Oh ! d — , ’ said I ; ‘ I am your man ; what do you ask ? ’
Isabella Thorpe	He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . ” “ And I am sure , ” said Catherine , “ I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . ” “ Neither one nor t’other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . ” “ That was very good - natured of you , ” said Catherine , quite pleased .
Isabella Thorpe	An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young ladies ; and , on finding whither they were going , it was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar ’s Buildings , and pay their respects to Mrs. Thorpe .
Isabella Thorpe	James and Isabella led the way ; and so well
Isabella Thorpe	satisfied was the latter with her lot , so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother ’s friend , and her friend ’s brother , so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings , that , though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street , she was so far from seeking to attract their notice , that she looked back at them only three times .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I will drive you up Lansdown Hill to - morrow . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Thank you ; but will not your horse want rest ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	No , no ; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Shall you indeed ! ” said Catherine very seriously .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Forty ! aye , fifty , for what I care . Well , I will drive you up Lansdown to - morrow ; mind , I am engaged . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ How delightful that will be ! ” cried Isabella , turning round .
Isabella Thorpe	My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother ,
Isabella Thorpe	no , no ; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about ; that would be a good joke , faith !
Isabella Thorpe	“ I think you must like Udolpho , if you were to read it ; it is so very interesting . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Aye , I remember , so it was ; I was thinking of that other stupid book , written by that woman they make such a fuss about , she who married the French emigrant . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I suppose you mean Camilla ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	an old man playing at see - saw , I took up the first volume once and looked it over , but I soon found it would not do ; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it : as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant , I was sure I should never be able to get through it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ You had no loss , I assure you ; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine ; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man ’s playing at see - saw and learning Latin ; upon my soul there is not . ”
Isabella Thorpe	This critique , the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine , brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe ’s lodgings , and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son , as they met Mrs. Thorpe , who had descried them from above , in the passage .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Ah , Mother ! How do you do ? ” said he , giving her a hearty shake of the hand .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Where did you get that quiz of a hat ?
Isabella Thorpe	It makes you look like an old witch .
Isabella Thorpe	Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you , so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near . ”
Isabella Thorpe	And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother ’s heart , for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection .
Isabella Thorpe	These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening .
Isabella Thorpe	“ He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Very , very much indeed : Isabella particularly . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you .
Isabella Thorpe	She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be ; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you , Catherine , ” taking her hand with affection , “ may be proud of . ”
Isabella Thorpe	You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Because I thought I should soon see you myself .
Isabella Thorpe	I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen .
Isabella Thorpe	I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , “ Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . ” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James ’s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet .
Isabella Thorpe	They will hardly follow us there . ” Away they walked to the book ; and while Isabella examined the names , it was Catherine ’s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men . “ They are not coming this way , are they ?
Isabella Thorpe	I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us .
Isabella Thorpe	Pray let me know if they are coming .
Isabella Thorpe	I am determined I will not look up . ”
Isabella Thorpe	In a few moments Catherine , with unaffected pleasure , assured her that she need not be longer uneasy , as the gentlemen had just left the pump - room .
Isabella Thorpe	“ And which way are they gone ? ” said Isabella , turning hastily round .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them !
Isabella Thorpe	and now , what say you to going to Edgar ’s Buildings with me , and looking at my new hat
Isabella Thorpe	If we make haste , we shall pass by them presently , and I am dying to show you my hat .
Isabella Thorpe	“ But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . ” “ I shall not pay them any such compliment , I assure you .
Isabella Thorpe	I have no notion of treating men with such respect .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning ; and therefore , to show the independence of Miss Thorpe , and her resolution of humbling the sex , they set off immediately as fast as they could walk , in pursuit of the two young men .
Isabella Thorpe	She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : “ Dear Catherine , “ Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me .
Isabella Thorpe	I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again .
Isabella Thorpe	Eleanor ’s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment ; but Henry began to suspect the truth , and something , in which Miss Thorpe ’s name was included , passed his lips .
Isabella Thorpe	His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable .
Isabella Thorpe	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer .
Isabella Thorpe	Miss Tilney , at Catherine ’s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe ’s connections and fortune .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Her mother is a very good sort of woman , ” was Catherine ’s answer .
Isabella Thorpe	“ What was her father ? ” “ A lawyer , I believe .
Isabella Thorpe	“ But , ” said Eleanor , after a short pause , “ would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ?
Isabella Thorpe	She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so .
Isabella Thorpe	Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe ’s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured .
Isabella Thorpe	27 The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella : _ Bath , April _
Isabella Thorpe	She was ashamed of Isabella , and ashamed of having ever loved her .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Write to James on her behalf !
Isabella Thorpe	no , James should never hear Isabella ’s name mentioned by her again . ”
Isabella Thorpe	When she had finished it—“So much for Isabella , ” she cried , “ and for all our intimacy !
Isabella Thorpe	she must think me an idiot , or she could not have written so ; but perhaps this has served to make
Isabella Thorpe	her
Isabella Thorpe	character better known to me than mine is to her
Isabella Thorpe	I see what she has been about .
Isabella Thorpe	She is a vain coquette , and her tricks have not answered .

Isabella Thorpe	He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself .
Isabella Thorpe	“ And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe .
Isabella Thorpe	Here Catherine and Isabella , arm in arm , again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation ; they talked much , and with much enjoyment ; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man , and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine , and would therefore shortly return .
Isabella Thorpe	They were changed into , “ How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! ” and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families , as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be ; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe , in what they called conversation , but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion , and not often any resemblance of subject , for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children , and Mrs. Allen of her gowns .
Isabella Thorpe	The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm , and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves .
Isabella Thorpe	Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater .
Isabella Thorpe	She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella ’s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James .
Isabella Thorpe	Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella .
Isabella Thorpe	But Isabella had promised and promised again ; and when she promised a thing , she was so scrupulous in performing it !
Isabella Thorpe	To expose a friend , such a friend as Isabella had been to her — and then their own brother so closely concerned in it !
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours !
Isabella Thorpe	I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family .
Isabella Thorpe	“ But , ” said Eleanor , after a short pause , “ would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ?
Isabella Thorpe	She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so .
Isabella Thorpe	You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy .
Isabella Thorpe	Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent .
Isabella Thorpe	She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : “ Dear Catherine , “ Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me .
Isabella Thorpe	I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again .
Isabella Thorpe	She has made me miserable forever !
Isabella Thorpe	Eleanor ’s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment ; but Henry began to suspect the truth , and something , in which Miss Thorpe ’s name was included , passed his lips .
Isabella Thorpe	His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable .
Isabella Thorpe	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer .
Isabella Thorpe	Miss Tilney , at Catherine ’s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe ’s connections and fortune .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Her mother is a very good sort of woman , ” was Catherine ’s answer .
Isabella Thorpe	“ What was her father ? ” “ A lawyer , I believe .
Isabella Thorpe	Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe ’s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured .
Isabella Thorpe	To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought
Isabella Thorpe	19 A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella seemed an altered creature .
Isabella Thorpe	When she saw her , indeed , surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar ’s Buildings or Pulteney Street , her change of manners was so trifling that , had it gone no farther , it might have passed unnoticed .
Isabella Thorpe	occasionally come across her ; but had nothing worse appeared , _ that _ might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest .
Isabella Thorpe	But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over .
Isabella Thorpe	What could be meant by such unsteady conduct , what her friend could be at ,
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting ; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent .
Isabella Thorpe	the woman might be who had given him her heart , to _ her _ it was always an object .
Isabella Thorpe	; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella ’s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it .
Isabella Thorpe	She wished , by a gentle remonstrance , to remind Isabella of her situation , and make her aware of this double unkindness ; but for remonstrance , either opportunity or comprehension was always against her .
Isabella Thorpe	If able to suggest a hint , Isabella could never understand it .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine blushed for her friend , and said , “ Isabella is wrong .
Isabella Thorpe	am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother .
Isabella Thorpe	After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , “ Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ” “ I can have no opinion on that subject . ”
Isabella Thorpe	If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ” “ My brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dear Miss Morland , ” said Henry , “ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ?
Isabella Thorpe	Are you not carried a little too far ?
Isabella Thorpe	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ?
Isabella Thorpe	He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it .
Isabella Thorpe	The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Her resolution was supported by Isabella ’s behaviour in their parting interview .
Isabella Thorpe	James was in excellent spirits , and Isabella most engagingly placid .
Isabella Thorpe	I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me .
Isabella Thorpe	I will look another way .
Isabella Thorpe	I hope this pleases you ” ( turning her back on him ) ; “ I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking .
Isabella Thorpe	But for this Isabella showed no inclination .
Isabella Thorpe	She was so amazingly tired , and it was so odious to parade about the pump - room ; and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters ; she was expecting her sisters every moment ;
Isabella Thorpe	so that her dearest Catherine must excuse her , and must sit quietly down again .
Isabella Thorpe	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney .
Isabella Thorpe	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement .
Isabella Thorpe	To doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible ; and yet , during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd .
Isabella Thorpe	She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self , and not so much about money , and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney .
Isabella Thorpe	How strange that she should not perceive his admiration !
Isabella Thorpe	catherine longed to give her a hint of it , to put her on her guard , and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother .
Isabella Thorpe	The compliment of John Thorpe ’s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister .
Isabella Thorpe	In vanity , therefore , she gained but little ; her chief profit was in wonder .
Isabella Thorpe	That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella talked of his attentions ; _ she _ had never been sensible of any ; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste , and
Isabella Thorpe	would never be said again ; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort .
Isabella Thorpe	She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement .
Isabella Thorpe	I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Is it my brother ’s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe ’s admission of them , that gives the pain ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ?
Isabella Thorpe	Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ?
Isabella Thorpe	The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Isabella , my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare !
Isabella Thorpe	my beloved creature , what do you mean ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I can not go , because”—looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella ’s smile—“I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk .
Isabella Thorpe	“ And well they might , for I never saw so much dirt in my life .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella corroborated it : “ My dearest Catherine , you can not form an idea of the dirt ; come , you must go ; you can not refuse going now . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits ; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce , in the fate of which she shared , by private partnership with Morland , a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton .
Isabella Thorpe	Her satisfaction , too , in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once .
Isabella Thorpe	“ How I pity the poor creatures that are going there !
Isabella Thorpe	how glad I am that I am not amongst them !
Isabella Thorpe	i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not !
Isabella Thorpe	I would not be there for all the world .
Isabella Thorpe	I dare say it will not be a very good ball .
Isabella Thorpe	I know the Mitchells will not be there .
Isabella Thorpe	I am sure I pity everybody that is .
Isabella Thorpe	But I dare say , Mr. Morland , you long to be at it , do not you ?
Isabella Thorpe	I am sure you do .
Isabella Thorpe	I dare say we could do very well without you ; but you men think yourselves of such consequence .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows , so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind , and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Do not be so dull , my dearest creature , ” she whispered .
Isabella Thorpe	“ You will quite break my heart .
Isabella Thorpe	i never was so happy in my life !
Isabella Thorpe	With a mind thus full of happiness , Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away , without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine , observing that Isabella ’s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other , as in eager expectation , and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch , thought the present a fine opportunity for being really so ; and therefore gaily said , “ Do not be uneasy , Isabella , James will soon be here .
Isabella Thorpe	my dear creature , ” she replied , “ do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow .
Isabella Thorpe	“ But I thought , Isabella , you had something in particular to tell me ? ” “ Oh yes , and so I have .
Isabella Thorpe	Well , the thing is this : I have just had a letter from John ; you can guess the contents .
Isabella Thorpe	“ With _ me _ , dear Isabella ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Are you ?
Isabella Thorpe	However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him .
Isabella Thorpe	Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I ought to say — but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way .
Isabella Thorpe	I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours , Isabella , I am sure ; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another—_he _ is not the person . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella was silent .
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dear friend , you must not be angry with me .
Isabella Thorpe	I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me .
Isabella Thorpe	And , you know , we shall still be sisters . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Well , my dear Catherine , the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John — is not it so ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . ” “ You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ” “ Oh !
Isabella Thorpe	as to that , ” answered Isabella laughingly , “ I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been .
Isabella Thorpe	But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely .
Isabella Thorpe	“ But my opinion of your brother never did alter ; it was always the same .
Isabella Thorpe	You are describing what never happened . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dearest Catherine , ” continued the other without at all listening to her , “ I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine , looking up , perceived Captain Tilney ; and Isabella , earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke , soon caught his notice .
Isabella Thorpe	Though spoken low , she could distinguish , “ What ! always to be watched , in person or by proxy ! ” “ Psha , nonsense ! ” was Isabella ’s answer in the same half whisper .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Why do you put such things into my head ?
Isabella Thorpe	If I could believe it — my spirit , you know , is pretty independent . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I wish your heart were independent .
Isabella Thorpe	That would be enough for me . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My heart , indeed !
Isabella Thorpe	what can you have to do with hearts ?
Isabella Thorpe	I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me .
Isabella Thorpe	I will look another way .
Isabella Thorpe	I hope this pleases you ” ( turning her back on him ) ; “ I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking .
Isabella Thorpe	But for this Isabella showed no inclination .
Isabella Thorpe	She was so amazingly tired , and it was so odious to parade about the pump - room ; and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters ; she was expecting her sisters every moment ;
Isabella Thorpe	so that her dearest Catherine must excuse her , and must sit quietly down again .
Isabella Thorpe	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney .
Isabella Thorpe	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement .
Isabella Thorpe	To doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible ; and yet , during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd .
Isabella Thorpe	She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self , and not so much about money , and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney .
Isabella Thorpe	How strange that she should not perceive his admiration !
Isabella Thorpe	catherine longed to give her a hint of it , to put her on her guard , and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother .
Isabella Thorpe	The compliment of John Thorpe ’s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister .
Isabella Thorpe	In vanity , therefore , she gained but little ; her chief profit was in wonder .
Isabella Thorpe	That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella talked of his attentions ; _ she _ had never been sensible of any ; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste , and
Isabella Thorpe	would never be said again ; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort .
Isabella Thorpe	19 A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella seemed an altered creature .
Isabella Thorpe	When she saw her , indeed , surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar ’s Buildings or Pulteney Street , her change of manners was so trifling that , had it gone no farther , it might have passed unnoticed .
Isabella Thorpe	occasionally come across her ; but had nothing worse appeared , _ that _ might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest .
Isabella Thorpe	But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over .
Isabella Thorpe	What could be meant by such unsteady conduct , what her friend could be at ,
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting ; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent .
Isabella Thorpe	the woman might be who had given him her heart , to _ her _ it was always an object .
Isabella Thorpe	; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella ’s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it .
Isabella Thorpe	She wished , by a gentle remonstrance , to remind Isabella of her situation , and make her aware of this double unkindness ; but for remonstrance , either opportunity or comprehension was always against her .
Isabella Thorpe	If able to suggest a hint , Isabella could never understand it .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine blushed for her friend , and said , “ Isabella is wrong .
Isabella Thorpe	am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother .
Isabella Thorpe	She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever .
Isabella Thorpe	You know she must be attached to him .
Isabella Thorpe	” “ I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ” “ Oh no , not flirts .
Isabella Thorpe	“ It is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly .
Isabella Thorpe	After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , “ Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ” “ I can have no opinion on that subject . ”
Isabella Thorpe	If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ” “ My brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ”
Isabella Thorpe	My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week ’s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . ” “ Well , ” said Catherine , after some moments ’ consideration , “ _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother ’s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not .
Isabella Thorpe	I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can .
Isabella Thorpe	Her resolution was supported by Isabella ’s behaviour in their parting interview .
Isabella Thorpe	James was in excellent spirits , and Isabella most engagingly placid .
Isabella Thorpe	She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement .
Isabella Thorpe	I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Is it my brother ’s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe ’s admission of them , that gives the pain ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ?
Isabella Thorpe	Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ?
Isabella Thorpe	The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine ’s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer .
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dearest creature , ” cried Isabella , to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage , “ you have been at least three hours getting ready .
Isabella Thorpe	you women are always thinking of men ’s being in liquor .
Isabella Thorpe	Why , you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle ?
Isabella Thorpe	I am sure of _ this_—that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day , there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now .
Isabella Thorpe	“ And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford . ” “ Oxford ! there is no drinking at Oxford now , I assure you .
Isabella Thorpe	Now , for instance , it was reckoned a remarkable thing , at the last party in my rooms , that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head .
Isabella Thorpe	But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there . ” “ Yes , it does give a notion , ” said Catherine warmly , “ and that is , that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did .
Isabella Thorpe	upon my soul , you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch .
Isabella Thorpe	It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld !
Isabella Thorpe	I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds . ”
Isabella Thorpe	It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure .
Isabella Thorpe	When they arrived at Mrs. Allen ’s door , the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed , on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house : “ Past three o’clock ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	and she would neither believe her own watch , nor her brother ’s , nor the servant ’s ; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality , till Morland produced his watch , and ascertained the fact ; to have doubted a moment longer _ then _ , would have been equally inconceivable , incredible , and impossible ; and she could only protest , over and over again , that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before , as Catherine was called on to confirm ; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella ; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend ’s dissenting voice , by not waiting for her answer .
Isabella Thorpe	Her own feelings entirely engrossed her ; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home .
Isabella Thorpe	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
Isabella Thorpe	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light .
Isabella Thorpe	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
Isabella Thorpe	After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , “ Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ” “ I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ” “ Well , proceed by all means .
Isabella Thorpe	My daughter , Miss Morland , ” he continued , without leaving his daughter time to speak , “ has been forming a very bold wish .
Isabella Thorpe	We leave Bath , as she has perhaps told you , on Saturday se’nnight .
Isabella Thorpe	And could we carry our selfish point with you , we should leave it without a single regret .
Isabella Thorpe	Can you , in short , be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire ?
Isabella Thorpe	I am almost ashamed to make the request , though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself .
Isabella Thorpe	If you can
Isabella Thorpe	be induced to honour us with a visit , you will make us happy beyond expression .
Isabella Thorpe	’ Tis true , we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place ; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour , for our mode of living , as you see , is plain and unpretending ; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable .
Isabella Thorpe	The affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister .
Isabella Thorpe	With all the chances against her of house , hall , place , park , court , and cottage , Northanger turned up an abbey , and she was to be its inhabitant .
Isabella Thorpe	Its long , damp passages , its narrow cells and ruined chapel , were to be within her daily reach ,
Isabella Thorpe	she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends , some awful memorials of an injured and ill - fated nun . It was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home , that the consciousness of it should be so meekly borne .
Isabella Thorpe	Many were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney ; but so active were her thoughts , that when these inquiries were answered , she was hardly more assured than before , of Northanger Abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation , of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution , of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed , or of its standing low in a valley , sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak .
Isabella Thorpe	There was a something , however , in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion ; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time , forgetting to speak or to listen , and almost forgetting where she was ; till , roused by the voice of Isabella , she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across .
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled , the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given ; but as it was not quite enough for Catherine ’s comprehension , she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner .
Isabella Thorpe	“ I can not think how it could happen !
Isabella Thorpe	“ And did Isabella never change her mind before ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ” “ I can not take surprise to myself on that head .
Isabella Thorpe	You bid me be surprised on your friend ’s account , and therefore I am ; but
Isabella Thorpe	as for my brother , his conduct in the business , I must own , has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to .
Isabella Thorpe	The fairness of your friend was an open attraction ; her firmness , you know , could only be understood by yourself . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . ”
Isabella Thorpe	When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour .
Isabella Thorpe	The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle !
Isabella Thorpe	amusing enough , if my mind had been disengaged ; but I would have given the world to sit still . ” “ Then why did not you ? ” “ Oh !
Isabella Thorpe	my
Isabella Thorpe	it would have looked so particular ; and you know how I abhor doing that .
Isabella Thorpe	I refused him as long as I possibly could , but he would take no denial .
Isabella Thorpe	You have no idea how he pressed me .
Isabella Thorpe	I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner — but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me .
Isabella Thorpe	i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so — and so then I found there would be no peace
Isabella Thorpe	if I did not stand up .
Isabella Thorpe	Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening .
Isabella Thorpe	I am so glad it is over !
Isabella Thorpe	my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense : and then , being such a smart young fellow , I saw every eye was upon us .
Isabella Thorpe	Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled .
Isabella Thorpe	“ It is very charming indeed , ” said Isabella , with a grave face .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Mr. Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed , ” said the gentle Mrs. Thorpe , looking anxiously at her daughter .
Isabella Thorpe	One could not expect more from him , you know .
Isabella Thorpe	Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed , but your wishes , my dear Isabella , are so moderate , you do not consider how little you ever want , my dear . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life .
Isabella Thorpe	For myself , it is nothing ; I never think of myself . ” “ I know you never do , my dear ; and you will always find your reward in
Isabella Thorpe	Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome , you know .
Isabella Thorpe	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure .
Isabella Thorpe	But everybody has their failing , you know , and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money . ”
Isabella Thorpe	Isabella recollected herself .
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , yes , my darling Isabella , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , “ we perfectly see into your heart .
Isabella Thorpe	You have no disguise .
Isabella Thorpe	We perfectly understand the present vexation ; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection . ”
Isabella Thorpe	She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella ’s regret ; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever , endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise .
John Thorpe	and then the brother , he , who had appeared so attached to you !
John Thorpe	And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day ? ”
John Thorpe	“ I do not say so ; but he did not seem in good spirits . ”
John Thorpe	Let me entreat you never to think of him again , my dear Catherine ; indeed he is unworthy of you . ”
John Thorpe	i do not suppose he ever thinks of me . ”
John Thorpe	“ That is exactly what I say ; he never thinks of you .
John Thorpe	how different to your brother and to mine !
John Thorpe	i really believe John has the most constant heart . ”
John Thorpe	John thinks very well of him , and John ’s judgment — ” “ Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . ”
John Thorpe	Charles Hodges will plague me to death , I dare say ; but I shall cut him very short .
John Thorpe	Ten to one but he guesses the reason , and that is exactly what I want to avoid , so I shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself .
John Thorpe	” Isabella ’s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend ; she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister ; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts .
John Thorpe	She looked at him with great admiration , and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother , though , in her eyes , his air was more assuming , and his countenance less prepossessing .
John Thorpe	At the end of the first dance , Captain Tilney came towards them again , and , much to Catherine ’s dissatisfaction , pulled his brother away .
John Thorpe	They retired whispering together ; and , though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm , and lay it down as fact , that Captain Tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her , which he now hastened to communicate to his brother , in the hope of separating them forever , she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations .
John Thorpe	Her suspense was of full five minutes ’ duration ; and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour , when they both returned , and an explanation was given , by Henry ’s requesting to know , if she thought her friend , Miss Thorpe , would have any objection to dancing , as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her .
John Thorpe	“ Your brother will not mind it , I know , ” said she , “ because I heard him say before that he hated dancing ; but it was very good - natured in him to think of it .
John Thorpe	I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down , and fancied she might wish for a partner ; but he is quite mistaken , for she would not dance upon any account in the world .
John Thorpe	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
John Thorpe	but , because — And your brother !
John Thorpe	after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ” “ I can not take surprise to myself on that head .
John Thorpe	You bid me be surprised on your friend ’s account , and therefore I am ; but
John Thorpe	as for my brother , his conduct in the business , I must own , has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to .
John Thorpe	When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour .

John Thorpe	i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so — and so then I found there would be no peace
John Thorpe	Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening .
John Thorpe	my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense : and then , being such a smart young fellow , I saw every eye was upon us .
John Thorpe	” “ He is very handsome indeed . ” “ Handsome !
John Thorpe	yes , I suppose he may .
John Thorpe	I dare say people would admire him in general ; but he is not at all in my style of beauty .
John Thorpe	However , he is very well .
John Thorpe	I took him down several times , you know , in my way . ”
John Thorpe	Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled .
John Thorpe	If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man .
John Thorpe	The long , long , endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living . ”
John Thorpe	John would have me go , for he vowed he would not drive her ,
John Thorpe	I remember I wore my yellow gown , with my hair done up in braids ; and when I came into the drawing - room , and John introduced him , I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before .
John Thorpe	John himself was no skulker in joy .
John Thorpe	He not only bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world , but swore off many sentences in his praise .
John Thorpe	The affair thus determined , and Thorpe ’s approbation secured , Catherine only remained to be apprised of it .
John Thorpe	But “ No , no , no ! ” was the immediate answer ; “ that could not be , for Thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on Tuesday . ”
John Thorpe	“ But why can not Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters ?
John Thorpe	“ Thank ye , ” cried Thorpe , “ but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about , and look like a fool .
John Thorpe	No , if you do not go , d — — me if I do
John Thorpe	I only go for the sake of driving you . ”
John Thorpe	But her words were lost on Thorpe , who had turned abruptly away
John Thorpe	Thus passed a long ten minutes , till they were again joined by Thorpe , who , coming to them with a gayer look , said , “ Well , I have settled the matter , and now we may all go to - morrow with a safe conscience .
John Thorpe	I have been to Miss Tilney , and made your excuses . ”
John Thorpe	“ You have not ! ” cried Catherine .
John Thorpe	“ I have , upon my soul .
John Thorpe	Told her you had sent me to say that , having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us to - morrow , you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday .
John Thorpe	now , my sweet Catherine ,
John Thorpe	Isabella , however , caught hold of one hand , Thorpe of the other , and remonstrances poured in from all three .
John Thorpe	Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message .
John Thorpe	This is only doing it in a ruder way ; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has — He may be mistaken again perhaps ; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday .
John Thorpe	Let me go , Mr. Thorpe ; Isabella , do not hold me . ”
John Thorpe	Thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys ; they were turning the corner into Brock Street , when he had overtaken them , and were at home by this time .
John Thorpe	Thorpe would have darted after her , but Morland withheld him .
John Thorpe	“ She is as obstinate as — ” Thorpe never finished the simile , for it could hardly have been a proper one . Away walked Catherine in great agitation , as fast as the crowd would permit her , fearful of being pursued , yet determined to persevere .
John Thorpe	Catherine found that John Thorpe _ had _ given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it .
John Thorpe	The affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father , and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe ’s information to her mind , and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on .
John Thorpe	To ease her mind , and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been , she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the half - settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following day .
John Thorpe	Mr. Allen caught at it directly .
John Thorpe	“ Well , ” said he , “ and do you think of going too ? ”
John Thorpe	“ No ; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it ; and therefore you know I could not go with them , could I ? ”
John Thorpe	“ No , certainly not ; and I am glad you do not think of it .
John Thorpe	it is not right ; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it .
John Thorpe	I am glad you do not think of going ; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased .
John Thorpe	Mrs. Allen , are not you of my way of thinking ?
John Thorpe	“ I know you do ; but that is not the question .
John Thorpe	I can not bear to see it . ”
John Thorpe	“ Dear madam , ” cried Catherine , “ then why did not you tell me so before ?
John Thorpe	I am sure if I had known it to be improper , I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all ; but I always hoped you would tell me , if you thought I was doing wrong . ”
John Thorpe	“ And so I should , my dear , you may depend on it ; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting , I would always do the best for you in my power .
John Thorpe	You know I wanted you , when we first came , not to buy that sprigged muslin , but you would .
John Thorpe	“ But this was something of real consequence ; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade .
John Thorpe	“ As far as it has gone hitherto , there is no harm done , ” said Mr. Allen ; “ and I would only advise you , my dear , not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any more .
John Thorpe	“ That is just what I was going to say , ” added his wife .
John Thorpe	Catherine , relieved for herself , felt uneasy for Isabella , and after a moment ’s thought , asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe , and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself ; for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day , in spite of what had passed .
John Thorpe	Mr. Allen , however , discouraged her from doing any such thing .
John Thorpe	“ You had better leave her alone , my dear ; she is old enough to know what she is about , and if not , has a mother to advise her .
John Thorpe	Catherine submitted , and though sorry to think that Isabella should be doing wrong , felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen ’s approbation of her own conduct , and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself .
John Thorpe	John Thorpe had first misled him .
John Thorpe	The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name .
John Thorpe	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
John Thorpe	With whomsoever he was , or was likely to be connected , his own consequence always required that theirs should be great , and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew , so regularly grew their fortune .
John Thorpe	The expectations of his friend Morland , therefore , from the first overrated
John Thorpe	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light .
John Thorpe	Thorpe ’s interest in the family , by his sister ’s approaching connection with one of its members , and his own views on another ( circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness ) , seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth ; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless , of Miss Morland ’s being under their care , and — as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge — of their treating her with parental kindness .
John Thorpe	His resolution was soon formed .
John Thorpe	Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son ; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe ’s communication , he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes .
John Thorpe	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .

The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
John Thorpe	The Allens , he believed , had lived near them too long , and he knew the young man on whom the Fullerton estate must devolve .
John Thorpe	John Thorpe , who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses , soon joined them , and from him she directly received the amends which were her due ; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella , on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow .
John Thorpe	He was a stout young man of middling height , who , with a plain face and ungraceful form , seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom , and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil , and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy .
John Thorpe	He took out his watch : “ How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury , Miss Morland ? ”
John Thorpe	John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine , and , after a few minutes ’ silence , renewed the conversation about his gig .
John Thorpe	“ You will find , however , Miss Morland , it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people , for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day ; Jackson , of Oriel , bid me sixty at once ; Morland was with me at the time . ”
John Thorpe	“ Yes , ” said Morland , who overheard this ; “ but you forget that your horse was included . ” “ My horse !
John Thorpe	i would not sell my horse for a hundred .
John Thorpe	“ Thank you , ” said Catherine , in some distress , from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer .
John Thorpe	Her companion ’s discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met ; and Catherine , after listening and agreeing as long as she could , with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind , fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self - assured man , especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned , ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts ; it was , “ Have you ever read Udolpho , Mr. Thorpe ? ” “ Udolpho !
John Thorpe	Catherine , humbled and ashamed , was going to apologize for her question , but he prevented her by saying , “ Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff ; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones , except The Monk ; I read that t’other day ; but as for all the others , they are the stupidest things in creation . ”
John Thorpe	“ Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe , ” said Catherine , with some hesitation , from the fear of mortifying him .
John Thorpe	This critique , the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine , brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe ’s lodgings , and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son , as they met Mrs. Thorpe , who had descried them from above , in the passage .
John Thorpe	“ Ah , Mother ! How do you do ? ” said he , giving her a hearty shake of the hand .
John Thorpe	And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother ’s heart , for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection .
John Thorpe	On his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness , for he asked each of them how they did , and observed that they both looked very ugly
John Thorpe	These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening .
John Thorpe	“ Indeed I am , ” she replied ; “ I love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too .
John Thorpe	my friend Thorpe ?
John Thorpe	” instead of answering , as she probably would have done , had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case , “ I do not like him at all , ” she directly replied , “ I like him very much ; he seems very agreeable .
John Thorpe	“ He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ”
John Thorpe	Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much .
John Thorpe	I have written to him and my father .
John Thorpe	Poor Thorpe is in town : I dread the sight of him ; his honest heart would feel so much .
John Thorpe	I have written to him and my father .
John Thorpe	the woman might be who had given him her heart , to _ her _ it was always an object .
John Thorpe	The compliment of John Thorpe ’s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister .
John Thorpe	She was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere ; for she had not forgotten that he could mistake , and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious .
John Thorpe	That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment .
John Thorpe	Isabella talked of his attentions ; _ she _ had never been sensible of any ; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste , and
John Thorpe	He might be jealous of her brother as a rival , but if more had seemed implied , the fault must have been in her misapprehension .
John Thorpe	She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement .
John Thorpe	“ My brother does know it , ” was Henry ’s answer .
John Thorpe	“ Does he ?
John Thorpe	Then why does he stay here ? ”
John Thorpe	He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , “ Why do not you persuade him to go away ?
John Thorpe	The longer he stays , the worse it will be for him at last .
John Thorpe	Pray advise him for his own sake , and for everybody ’s sake , to leave Bath directly .
John Thorpe	Absence will in time make him comfortable again ; but he can have no hope here , and it is only staying to be miserable . ”
John Thorpe	Henry smiled and said , “ I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . ”
John Thorpe	“ Then you will persuade him to go away ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him .
John Thorpe	I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged .
John Thorpe	He knows what he is about , and must be his own master . ”
John Thorpe	“ No , he does not know what he is about , ” cried Catherine ; “ he does not know the pain he is giving my brother .
John Thorpe	Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable .
John Thorpe	“ And are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ” “ Yes , very sure . ”
John Thorpe	“ Is it my brother ’s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe ’s admission of them , that gives the pain ? ”
John Thorpe	am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother .
John Thorpe	After a short pause , Catherine resumed with , “ Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ” “ I can have no opinion on that subject . ”
John Thorpe	“ But what can your brother mean ?
John Thorpe	If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ” “ My brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ”
John Thorpe	My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week ’s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . ” “ Well , ” said Catherine , after some moments ’ consideration , “ _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother ’s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not .
John Thorpe	“ My dear Miss Morland , ” said Henry , “ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ?
John Thorpe	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ?
John Thorpe	He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it .
John Thorpe	You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend
John Thorpe	The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ”
John Thorpe	Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking .
John Thorpe	catherine longed to give her a hint of it , to put her on her guard , and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother .
John Thorpe	John Thorpe was soon with them , and his voice was with them yet sooner , for on the stairs he was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick .
John Thorpe	“ Make haste ! make haste ! ” as he threw open the door .
John Thorpe	But , however , I can not go with you to - day , because I am engaged ; I expect some friends every moment . ”
John Thorpe	This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all ; Mrs. Allen was called on to second him , and the two others walked in , to give their assistance .
John Thorpe	“ You croaking fellow ! ” cried Thorpe .
John Thorpe	my beloved creature , what do you mean ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Not they indeed , ” cried Thorpe ; “ for , as we turned into Broad Street , I saw them — does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts ? ” “ I do not know indeed . ”
John Thorpe	You are talking of the man you danced with last night , are not you ?
John Thorpe	“ Well , I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road , driving a smart - looking girl . ”
John Thorpe	“ Did you indeed ? ” “ Did upon my soul ; knew him again directly , and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too . ”
John Thorpe	but I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk . ”
John Thorpe	Thorpe talked to his horse , and she meditated , by turns , on broken promises and broken arches , phaetons and false hangings , Tilneys and trap - doors .
John Thorpe	As they entered Argyle Buildings , however , she was roused by this address from her companion , “ Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Stop , stop , Mr. Thorpe , ” she impatiently cried ; “ it is Miss Tilney ; it is indeed .
John Thorpe	How could you tell me they were gone ?
John Thorpe	Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot ; the Tilneys , who had soon ceased to look after her , were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place , and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace .
John Thorpe	, she entreated him to stop .
John Thorpe	“ Pray , pray stop , Mr. Thorpe .
John Thorpe	But Mr. Thorpe only laughed , smacked his whip , encouraged his horse , made odd noises , and drove on ; and Catherine , angry and vexed as she was , having no power of getting away , was obliged to give up the point and submit .
John Thorpe	“ How could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ?
John Thorpe	How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road ?
John Thorpe	you do not know how vexed I am ; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton , nor in anything else .
John Thorpe	How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton ? ”
John Thorpe	Thorpe defended himself very stoutly , declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life , and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself .
John Thorpe	The others then came close enough for conversation , and Morland said , “ We had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on to - day ; your sister thinks so as well as I.
John Thorpe	“ It is all one to me , ” replied Thorpe rather angrily ; and instantly turning his horse , they were on their way back to Bath .
John Thorpe	Thorpe then said something in the loud , incoherent way to which he had often recourse , about its being a d — — thing to be miserly ; and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things , he did not know who could , which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand .
John Thorpe	Disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment , she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so ; and they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words . As she entered the house , the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off ; that , when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe , the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her ; and on his saying no , had felt for a card , but said she had none about her , and went away .
John Thorpe	I am sure John and I should not have minded it .
John Thorpe	I never mind going through anything , where a friend is concerned ; that is my disposition , and John is just the same ; he has amazing strong feelings .
John Thorpe	Well , the thing is this : I have just had a letter from John ; you can guess the contents .
John Thorpe	What can he write about , but yourself ?
John Thorpe	You know he is over head and ears in love with you . ”
John Thorpe	His attentions were such as a child must have noticed .
John Thorpe	And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement .
John Thorpe	He says so in this letter , says that he as good as made you an offer , and that you received his advances in the kindest way ; and now he wants me to urge his suit , and say all manner of pretty things to you .
John Thorpe	“ But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar ’s Buildings — it was the day your father ’s consent came — and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . ”
John Thorpe	I _ do _ remember now being with you , and seeing him as well as the rest — but that we were ever alone for five minutes —
John Thorpe	However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him .
John Thorpe	I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me — but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side ; I never had the smallest idea of it .
John Thorpe	Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I ought to say — but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way .
John Thorpe	I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me .
John Thorpe	Well , my dear Catherine , the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John — is not it so ? ”
John Thorpe	“ I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . ” “ Since that is the case , I am sure I shall not tease you any further .
John Thorpe	John desired me to speak to you on the subject , and therefore I have .
John Thorpe	But I confess , as soon as I read his letter , I thought it a very foolish , imprudent business , and not likely to promote the good of either ; for what were you to live upon , supposing you came together ?
John Thorpe	I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . ” “ You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ” “ Oh !
John Thorpe	“ But my opinion of your brother never did alter ; it was always the same .
John Thorpe	I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother , because he is my brother , and who perhaps after all , you know , might be just as happy without you , for people seldom know what they would be at , young men especially , they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant .
John Thorpe	Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking .
John Thorpe	catherine longed to give her a hint of it , to put her on her guard , and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother .
John Thorpe	Catherine , with all the earnestness of truth , expressed her astonishment at such a charge , protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe ’s being in love with her , and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him .
John Thorpe	“ As to any attentions on his side
John Thorpe	, I do declare , upon my honour , I never was sensible of them for a moment — except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming .
John Thorpe	The last half hour before he went away !
John Thorpe	it must be all and completely a mistake — for I did not see him once that whole morning . ”
John Thorpe	The compliment of John Thorpe ’s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister .
John Thorpe	She was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere ; for she had not forgotten that he could mistake , and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious .
John Thorpe	That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment .
John Thorpe	Isabella talked of his attentions ; _ she _ had never been sensible of any ; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste , and
John Thorpe	At about half past twelve , a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window , and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door , in the first only a servant , her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second , before John Thorpe came running upstairs , calling out , “ Well , Miss Morland , here I am .
John Thorpe	By him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten ; and all the rest of his conversation , or rather talk , began and ended with himself and his own concerns .
John Thorpe	He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums ; of racing matches , in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner ; of shooting parties , in which he had killed more birds ( though without having one good shot ) than all his companions together ; and described to her some famous day ’s sport , with the fox - hounds , in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman , and in which the boldness of his riding , though it had never endangered his own life for a moment , had been constantly leading others into difficulties , which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many .
John Thorpe	Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself , and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be , she could not entirely repress a doubt , while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit , of his being altogether completely agreeable .
John Thorpe	It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure .
John Thorpe	Could she have foreseen such a circumstance , nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others ; and , as it was , she could only lament her ill luck , and think over what she had lost , till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable .
John Thorpe	This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply , of which no part was very distinct , except the frequent exclamations , amounting almost to oaths , which adorned it , and Catherine was left , when it ended , with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford , and the same happy conviction of her brother ’s comparative sobriety .
John Thorpe	Do let us turn back , Mr. Thorpe ; stop and speak to my brother , and tell him how very unsafe it is . ”
John Thorpe	It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure .
John Thorpe	When they arrived at Mrs. Allen ’s door , the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed , on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house : “ Past three o’clock ! ”
John Thorpe	and she would neither believe her own watch , nor her brother ’s , nor the servant ’s ; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality , till Morland produced his watch , and ascertained the fact ; to have doubted a moment longer _ then _ , would have been equally inconceivable , incredible , and impossible ; and she could only protest , over and over again , that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before , as Catherine was called on to confirm ; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella ; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend ’s dissenting voice , by not waiting for her answer .
John Thorpe	Catherine inquired no further ; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give , and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister .
John Thorpe	It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe ’s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it ; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor , and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds . This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride ; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence , which he was at some pains to procure , that the Fullerton estate , being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor , was consequently open to every greedy speculation .
John Thorpe	John Thorpe had first misled him .
John Thorpe	The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name .
John Thorpe	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
John Thorpe	With whomsoever he was , or was likely to be connected , his own consequence always required that theirs should be great , and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew , so regularly grew their fortune .
John Thorpe	The expectations of his friend Morland , therefore , from the first overrated
John Thorpe	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light .
John Thorpe	Thorpe ’s interest in the family , by his sister ’s approaching connection with one of its members , and his own views on another ( circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness ) , seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth ; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless , of Miss Morland ’s being under their care , and — as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge — of their treating her with parental kindness .
John Thorpe	His resolution was soon formed .
John Thorpe	Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son ; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe ’s communication , he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes .
John Thorpe	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .

The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
John Thorpe	The Allens , he believed , had lived near them too long , and he knew the young man on whom the Fullerton estate must devolve .
John Thorpe	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
John Thorpe	but , because — And your brother !
John Thorpe	after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ” “ I can not take surprise to myself on that head .
John Thorpe	You bid me be surprised on your friend ’s account , and therefore I am ; but
John Thorpe	as for my brother , his conduct in the business , I must own , has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to .
John Thorpe	When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour .
John Thorpe	The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle !
John Thorpe	I refused him as long as I possibly could , but he would take no denial .
John Thorpe	You have no idea how he pressed me .
John Thorpe	I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner — but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me .
John Thorpe	i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so — and so then I found there would be no peace
John Thorpe	Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening .
John Thorpe	my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense : and then , being such a smart young fellow , I saw every eye was upon us .
John Thorpe	” “ He is very handsome indeed . ” “ Handsome !
John Thorpe	yes , I suppose he may .
John Thorpe	I dare say people would admire him in general ; but he is not at all in my style of beauty .
John Thorpe	However , he is very well .
John Thorpe	I took him down several times , you know , in my way . ”
John Thorpe	Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled .
John Thorpe	If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man .
John Thorpe	The long , long , endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living . ”
Frederick Tilney	Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother , Captain Tilney , was expected almost every hour , she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable - looking , handsome young man , whom she had never seen before , and who now evidently belonged to their party .
Frederick Tilney	She looked at him with great admiration , and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother , though , in her eyes , his air was more assuming , and his countenance less prepossessing .
Frederick Tilney	His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior ; for , within her hearing , he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself , but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it possible .
Frederick Tilney	From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that , whatever might be our heroine ’s opinion of him , his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind ; not likely to produce animosities between the brothers , nor persecutions to the lady . _
Frederick Tilney	He _ can not be the instigator of the three villains in horsemen ’s greatcoats , by whom she will hereafter be forced into a traveling - chaise and four , which will drive off with incredible speed .
Frederick Tilney	They retired whispering together ; and , though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm , and lay it down as fact , that Captain Tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her , which he now hastened to communicate to his brother , in the hope of separating them forever , she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations .
Frederick Tilney	The cruel reply was passed on to the other , and he immediately walked away .
Frederick Tilney	She was as insignificant , and perhaps as portionless , as Isabella ; and if the heir of the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself , at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest ?
Frederick Tilney	“ No , ” said he , “ my father ’s hands need not be strengthened , and Frederick ’s confession of folly need not be
Frederick Tilney	He must tell his own story .
Frederick Tilney	“ But he will tell only half of it . ”
Frederick Tilney	The General , meanwhile , though offended every morning by Frederick ’s remissness in writing , was free from any real anxiety about him , and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland ’s time at Northanger pass pleasantly .
Frederick Tilney	And it all ended , at last , in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston , they would take him by surprise there some day or other , and eat their mutton with him .
Frederick Tilney	But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella ’s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations .
Frederick Tilney	A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney .
Frederick Tilney	His brother and sister knew not what to think .
Frederick Tilney	Sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement , and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it .
Frederick Tilney	This was the sad finale of every reflection : and Captain Tilney ’s letter would certainly come in his absence ; and Wednesday she was very sure would be wet .
Frederick Tilney	You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away .
Frederick Tilney	Afterwards he got worse , and became quite my shadow .
Frederick Tilney	He went away to his regiment two days ago , and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again .
Frederick Tilney	He is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw , and amazingly disagreeable .
Frederick Tilney	The last two days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis : I pitied his taste , but took no notice of him .
Frederick Tilney	The last time we met was in Bath Street , and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me ; I would not even look at him .
Frederick Tilney	He went into the pump - room afterwards ; but I would not have followed him for all the world .
Frederick Tilney	Such a contrast between him and your brother !
Frederick Tilney	pray send me some news of the latter — I am quite unhappy about him ; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away , with a cold , or something that affected his spirits .
Frederick Tilney	I would write to him myself , but have mislaid his direction ; and , as I hinted above , am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss .
Frederick Tilney	Pray explain everything to his satisfaction ; or , if he still harbours any doubt , a line from himself to me , or a call at Putney when next in town , might set all to rights .
Frederick Tilney	they teased me into it ; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone .
Frederick Tilney	Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it — it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take .
Frederick Tilney	I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time .
Frederick Tilney	Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ?
Frederick Tilney	“ I have very little to say for Frederick ’s motives , such as I believe them to have been .
Frederick Tilney	He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself .
Frederick Tilney	If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . ”
Frederick Tilney	“ Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ?
Frederick Tilney	“ I am persuaded that he never did . ” “ And only made believe to do so for mischief ’s sake ? ” Henry bowed his assent .
Frederick Tilney	“ Well , then , I must say that I do not like him at all .
Frederick Tilney	Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all .
Frederick Tilney	But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? ”
Frederick Tilney	“ But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose — consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . ” “ It is very right that you should stand by your brother . ”
Frederick Tilney	Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty , while Henry made himself so agreeable .
Frederick Tilney	Catherine walked on to her chamber , making up her mind as well as she could , to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney , and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her , and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her , that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful .
Frederick Tilney	She trusted he would never speak of Miss Thorpe ; and indeed , as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted
Frederick Tilney	, there could be no danger of it ; and as long as all mention of Bath scenes were avoided , she thought she could behave to him very civilly .
Frederick Tilney	In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent .
Frederick Tilney	Catherine , supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney ’s account
Frederick Tilney	And all this by such a man as General Tilney , so polite , so well bred , and heretofore so particularly fond of her !
Frederick Tilney	The manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil , hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience , or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling ; of two days , the earliest fixed on , and of that almost the earliest hour , as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning , that he might not be obliged even to see her .
Frederick Tilney	By some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offend him .
Frederick Tilney	I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced .
Frederick Tilney	I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney .
Frederick Tilney	“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ”
Frederick Tilney	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer .
Frederick Tilney	Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected .
Frederick Tilney	I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . ”
Frederick Tilney	“ But , ” said Eleanor , after a short pause , “ would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ?
Frederick Tilney	And how strange an infatuation on Frederick ’s side !
Frederick Tilney	a girl who , before his eyes , is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man !
Frederick Tilney	Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly !
Frederick Tilney	“ That is the most unpromising circumstance , the strongest presumption against him .
Frederick Tilney	When I think of his past declarations , I give him up .
Frederick Tilney	It is all over with Frederick indeed !
Frederick Tilney	he is a deceased man — defunct in understanding .
Frederick Tilney	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ” replied Henry ; “ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance .
Frederick Tilney	they teased me into it ; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone .
Frederick Tilney	Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it — it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take .

Frederick Tilney	Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all .
Frederick Tilney	But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? ”
Frederick Tilney	Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty , while Henry made himself so agreeable .
Frederick Tilney	She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella ’s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James .
Frederick Tilney	James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton .
Frederick Tilney	“ ’ Tis only from James , however , ” as she looked at the direction .
Frederick Tilney	You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God !
Frederick Tilney	poor James is so unhappy !
Frederick Tilney	“ To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , ” replied Henry warmly , “ must be a comfort to him under any distress . ”
Frederick Tilney	“ I have one favour to beg , ” said Catherine , shortly afterwards , in an agitated manner , “ that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . ”
Frederick Tilney	“ Our brother !
Frederick Tilney	frederick ! ”
Frederick Tilney	Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours !
Frederick Tilney	could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ” “ I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed .
Frederick Tilney	I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland ’s disappointment .
Frederick Tilney	His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable .
Frederick Tilney	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer .
Frederick Tilney	“ I do not know what I was thinking of ” ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; “ James only means to give me good advice . ”
Frederick Tilney	He gladly received the letter , and , having read it through , with close attention , returned it saying , “ Well , if it is to be so , I can only say that I am sorry for it .
Frederick Tilney	Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected .
Frederick Tilney	I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . ”
Frederick Tilney	She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so .
Frederick Tilney	And how strange an infatuation on Frederick ’s side !
Frederick Tilney	a girl who , before his eyes , is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man !
Frederick Tilney	Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly !
Frederick Tilney	“ That is the most unpromising circumstance , the strongest presumption against him .
Frederick Tilney	When I think of his past declarations , I give him up .
Frederick Tilney	It is all over with Frederick indeed !
Frederick Tilney	he is a deceased man — defunct in understanding .
Frederick Tilney	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ” replied Henry ; “ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance .
Frederick Tilney	“ My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it .
Frederick Tilney	“ Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours .
Frederick Tilney	I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known , or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced .
Frederick Tilney	I can not understand even now what she would be at , for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney .
Frederick Tilney	“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ”
Frederick Tilney	But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over .
Frederick Tilney	For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned .
Frederick Tilney	Though his looks did not please her , his name was a passport to her goodwill , and she thought with sincere compassion of
Frederick Tilney	his approaching disappointment
Frederick Tilney	; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella ’s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it .
Frederick Tilney	He might be jealous of her brother as a rival , but if more had seemed implied , the fault must have been in her misapprehension .
Frederick Tilney	became her chief consolation ; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days , and Captain Tilney ’s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own .
Frederick Tilney	But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing ; he was not to be of the party to Northanger ; he was to continue at Bath .
Frederick Tilney	Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ?
Frederick Tilney	Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go .
Frederick Tilney	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ?
Frederick Tilney	Is he safe only in solitude ?
Frederick Tilney	Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ?
Frederick Tilney	You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend
Frederick Tilney	The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ”
Frederick Tilney	Henry Tilney must know best .
Frederick Tilney	I hope this pleases you ” ( turning her back on him ) ; “ I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
Frederick Tilney	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney .
Frederick Tilney	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement .
Frederick Tilney	She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self , and not so much about money , and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney .
Frederick Tilney	How strange that she should not perceive his admiration !
Frederick Tilney	catherine longed to give her a hint of it , to put her on her guard , and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother .
Frederick Tilney	” “ I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ” “ Oh no , not flirts .
Frederick Tilney	Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “ Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us .
Frederick Tilney	His leave of absence will soon expire , and he must return to his regiment .
Frederick Tilney	Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession .
Frederick Tilney	Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp . ”
Frederick Tilney	Tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections , and I believe he is very right .
Frederick Tilney	here he comes ; never mind , he will not see us , I am sure .
Frederick Tilney	Catherine , looking up , perceived Captain Tilney ; and Isabella , earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke , soon caught his notice .
Frederick Tilney	He approached immediately , and took the seat to which her movements invited him .
Frederick Tilney	His first address made Catherine start .
Frederick Tilney	I hope this pleases you ” ( turning her back on him ) ; “ I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
Frederick Tilney	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney .

Frederick Tilney	But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over .
Frederick Tilney	James was the sufferer .
Frederick Tilney	She saw him grave and uneasy ; and however careless of his present comfort
Frederick Tilney	the woman might be who had given him her heart , to _ her _ it was always an object .
Frederick Tilney	For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned .
Frederick Tilney	Though his looks did not please her , his name was a passport to her goodwill , and she thought with sincere compassion of
Frederick Tilney	his approaching disappointment
Frederick Tilney	; for , in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump - room , his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella ’s engagement that she could not , upon reflection , imagine him aware of it .

Frederick Tilney	But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing ; he was not to be of the party to Northanger ; he was to continue at Bath .
Frederick Tilney	She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement .
Frederick Tilney	“ My brother does know it , ” was Henry ’s answer .
Frederick Tilney	He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , “ Why do not you persuade him to go away ?
Frederick Tilney	Henry smiled and said , “ I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . ”
Frederick Tilney	“ Then you will persuade him to go away ? ”
Frederick Tilney	“ Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him .
Frederick Tilney	I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged .
Frederick Tilney	Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable .
Frederick Tilney	“ And are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ” “ Yes , very sure . ”
Frederick Tilney	You know she must be attached to him .
Frederick Tilney	” “ I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ” “ Oh no , not flirts .
Frederick Tilney	Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ?
Frederick Tilney	Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go .
Frederick Tilney	“ My dear Miss Morland , ” said Henry , “ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ?
Frederick Tilney	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ?
Frederick Tilney	Is he safe only in solitude ?
Frederick Tilney	Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ?
Frederick Tilney	He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it .
Frederick Tilney	You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend
Frederick Tilney	Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “ Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us .
Frederick Tilney	The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ”
Frederick Tilney	Henry Tilney must know best .
Frederick Tilney	James was in excellent spirits , and Isabella most engagingly placid .
Frederick Tilney	Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart ; but that at such a moment was allowable ; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction , and once she drew back her hand ; but Catherine remembered Henry ’s instructions , and placed it all to judicious affection .
Frederick Tilney	” “ I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ” “ Oh no , not flirts .
Frederick Tilney	Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “ Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us .
Frederick Tilney	His leave of absence will soon expire , and he must return to his regiment .
Mrs. Allen	The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother ’s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in Mr. and Mrs. Allen , by the communication of the wonderful event .
Mrs. Allen	The disclosure , however , of the great secret of James ’s going to Fullerton the day before , did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen .
Mrs. Allen	She could not listen to that with perfect calmness , but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment , wished she could have known his intention , wished she could have seen him before he went , as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother , and her kind compliments to all the Skinners .
Mrs. Allen	I only go for the sake of driving you . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ I am come in a great hurry — It was all a mistake — I never promised to go — I told them from the first I could not go.—I ran away in a great hurry to explain it.—I did not care what you thought of me.—I would not stay for the servant . ”
Mrs. Allen	Mr. and Mrs. Allen would expect her back every moment .
Mrs. Allen	The General declared he could say no more ; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded ; but on some other day he trusted , when longer notice could be given , they would not refuse to spare her to her friend .
Mrs. Allen	Mrs. Allen , are not you of my way of thinking ?
Mrs. Allen	Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable ? ” “ Yes , very much so indeed .
Mrs. Allen	“ Yes , my dear , a very odd appearance indeed .
Mrs. Allen	“ That is just what I was going to say , ” added his wife .
Mrs. Allen	The wish of a numerous acquaintance in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen , and she repeated it after every fresh proof , which every morning brought , of her knowing nobody at all .
Mrs. Allen	“ I danced with a very agreeable young man , introduced by Mr. King ; had a great deal of conversation with him — seems a most extraordinary genius — hope I may know more of him .
Mrs. Allen	They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen :
Mrs. Allen	“ My dear Catherine , ” said she , “ do take this pin out of my sleeve ; I am afraid it has torn a hole already ; I shall be quite sorry if it has , for this is a favourite gown , though it cost but nine shillings a yard .
Mrs. Allen	“ That is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , ” said Mr. Tilney , looking at the muslin .
Mrs. Allen	“ Particularly well ; I always buy my own cravats , and am allowed to be an excellent judge ; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown .
Mrs. Allen	I bought one for her the other day , and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it .
Mrs. Allen	I gave but five shillings a yard for it , and a true Indian muslin . ”
Mrs. Allen	Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius .
Mrs. Allen	“ Men commonly take so little notice of those things , ” said she ; “ I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another .
Mrs. Allen	You must be a great comfort to your sister , sir . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ I hope I am , madam . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ And pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland ’s gown ? ” “ It is very pretty , madam , ” said he , gravely examining it ; “ but I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ How can you , ” said Catherine , laughing , “ be so — ”
Mrs. Allen	“ I am quite of your opinion , sir , ” replied Mrs. Allen ; “ and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ But then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak .
Mrs. Allen	I have heard my sister say so forty times , when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted , or careless in cutting it to pieces . ”
Mrs. Allen	We are sadly off in the country ; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury , but it is so far to go — eight miles is a long way ; Mr. Allen says it is nine , measured nine ; but I am sure it can not be more than eight ; and it is such a fag — I come back tired to death .
Mrs. Allen	Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said ; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced .
Mrs. Allen	Catherine feared , as she listened to their discourse , that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others .
Mrs. Allen	“ What are you thinking of so earnestly ? ” said he , as they walked back to the ballroom ; “ not of your partner , I hope , for , by that shake of the head , your meditations are not satisfactory . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . ”
Mrs. Allen	They danced again ; and , when the assembly closed , parted , on the lady ’s side at least , with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance .
Mrs. Allen	Whether she thought of him so much , while she drank her warm wine and water , and prepared herself for bed , as to dream of him when there , can not be ascertained ; but I hope it was no more than in a
Mrs. Allen	How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen ’s head , but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied ; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was , and had been assured of Mr. Tilney ’s being a clergyman , and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire
Mrs. Allen	After a couple of minutes ’ unbroken silence , Henry , turning to Catherine for the first time since her mother ’s entrance , asked her , with sudden alacrity , if Mr. and Mrs. Allen were now at Fullerton ?
Mrs. Allen	Mr. Allen ’s grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often .
Mrs. Allen	A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application .
Mrs. Allen	For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate .
Mrs. Allen	How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself .
Mrs. Allen	“ Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then .
Mrs. Allen	I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella .
Mrs. Allen	her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment .
Mrs. Allen	and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ” Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself .
Mrs. Allen	His wonder , his conjectures , and his explanations became in succession hers , with the addition of this single remark—“I really have not patience with the General”—to fill up every accidental pause .
Mrs. Allen	And , “ I really have not patience with the General , ” was uttered twice after Mr. Allen left the room , without any relaxation of anger , or any material digression of thought .
Mrs. Allen	A more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition ; and , after completing the fourth , she immediately added , “ Only think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was .
Mrs. Allen	I must show it you some day or other .
Mrs. Allen	I assure you I did not above half like coming away .
Mrs. Allen	You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . ”
Mrs. Allen	My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ?
Mrs. Allen	I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since .
Mrs. Allen	Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I really have not patience with the General !
Mrs. Allen	i do not suppose , Mrs. Morland , you ever saw a better - bred man in your life .
Mrs. Allen	As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter ’s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends .
Mrs. Allen	From the Thorpes she could learn nothing , for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen .
Mrs. Allen	Mrs. Allen was now quite happy — quite satisfied with Bath .
Mrs. Allen	She had found some acquaintance , had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend ; and , as the completion of good fortune , had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself .
Mrs. Allen	Her daily expressions were no longer , “ I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath ! ”
Mrs. Allen	They were changed into , “ How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! ” and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families , as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be ; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe , in what they called conversation , but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion , and not often any resemblance of subject , for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children , and Mrs. Allen of her gowns .
Mrs. Allen	Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking .
Mrs. Allen	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney .
Mrs. Allen	I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella .
Mrs. Allen	her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment .
Mrs. Allen	and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ” Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself .
Mrs. Allen	His wonder , his conjectures , and his explanations became in succession hers , with the addition of this single remark—“I really have not patience with the General”—to fill up every accidental pause .
Mrs. Allen	As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter ’s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends .
Mrs. Allen	Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . ” “ But now you love a hyacinth .
Mrs. Allen	“ Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then .
Mrs. Allen	She applied to Mrs. Allen , and Mrs. Allen ’s opinion was more positive .
Mrs. Allen	At about eleven o’clock , however , a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine ’s watchful eye , and “ Oh ! dear , I do believe it will be wet , ” broke from her in a most desponding tone . “ I thought how it would be , ” said Mrs. Allen . “ No walk for me to - day , ” sighed Catherine ; “ but perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Perhaps it may , but then , my dear , it will be so dirty . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ No , ” replied her friend very placidly , “ I know you never mind dirt . ” After a short pause , “ It comes on faster and faster ! ” said Catherine , as she stood watching at a window .
Mrs. Allen	It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump - room ; he accordingly set off by himself , and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages , containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back .
Mrs. Allen	Mrs. Allen agreed to it .
Mrs. Allen	John Thorpe was soon with them , and his voice was with them yet sooner , for on the stairs he was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick .
Mrs. Allen	“ Put on your hat this moment — there is no time to be lost — we are going to Bristol .
Mrs. Allen	How d’ye do , Mrs. Allen ? ”
Mrs. Allen	But , however , I can not go with you to - day , because I am engaged ; I expect some friends every moment . ”
Mrs. Allen	This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all ; Mrs. Allen was called on to second him , and the two others walked in , to give their assistance .
Mrs. Allen	“ I doubt our being able to do so much , ” said Morland .
Mrs. Allen	“ You croaking fellow ! ” cried Thorpe .
Mrs. Allen	Shall I go , Mrs. Allen ? ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Mrs. Allen , you must persuade her to go , ” was the general cry .
Mrs. Allen	Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it : “ Well , my dear , ” said she , “ suppose you go . ”
Mrs. Allen	She began first to be sensible of this , and to sigh for her conversation , as she walked along the pump - room one morning , by Mrs. Allen ’s side , without anything to say or to hear ; and scarcely had she felt a five minutes ’ longing of friendship , before the object of it appeared , and inviting her to a secret conference , led the way to a seat . “ This is my favourite place , ” said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors , which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either ; “ it is so out of the way . ”
Mrs. Allen	Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking .
Mrs. Allen	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney .
Mrs. Allen	Her plan for the morning thus settled , she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast , resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one ; and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen , whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such , that as she never talked a great deal , so she could never be entirely silent ; and , therefore , while she sat at her work , if she lost her needle or broke her thread , if she heard a carriage in the street , or saw a speck upon her gown , she must observe it aloud , whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not .
Mrs. Allen	How do you do , Mrs. Allen ?
Mrs. Allen	“ What do you mean ? ” said Catherine .
Mrs. Allen	“ Something was said about it , I remember , ” said Catherine , looking at Mrs. Allen for her opinion ; “ but really I did not expect you .
Mrs. Allen	Catherine ’s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer .
Mrs. Allen	“ Well , ma’am , what do you say to it ?
Mrs. Allen	Can you spare me for an hour or two ?
Mrs. Allen	“ Do just as you please , my dear , ” replied Mrs. Allen , with the most placid indifference .
Mrs. Allen	In a very few minutes she reappeared , having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise , after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen ’s admiration of his gig ; and then receiving her friend ’s parting good wishes , they both hurried downstairs .
Mrs. Allen	When they arrived at Mrs. Allen ’s door , the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed , on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house : “ Past three o’clock ! ”
Mrs. Allen	Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning , and was immediately greeted with , “ Well , my dear , here you are , ” a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute ; “ and I hope you have had a pleasant airing ? ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Yes , ma’am , I thank you ; we could not have had a nicer day . ”
Mrs. Allen	a vast deal indeed ; she hardly talked of anything else . ” “ Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from ? ” “ Yes , she did ; but I can not recollect now .
Mrs. Allen	Catherine inquired no further ; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give , and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister .
Mrs. Allen	How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself .
Mrs. Allen	They returned to the hall , that the chief staircase might be ascended , and the beauty of its wood , and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out : having gained the top , they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which her room lay , and shortly entered one on the same plan , but superior in length and breadth .
Mrs. Allen	Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did — they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way .
Mrs. Allen	A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application .
Mrs. Allen	For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate .
James Morland	Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it ; and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world , that nobody could imagine how charming it had been , and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive . Such was the information of the first five minutes ; the second unfolded thus much in detail — that they had driven directly to the York Hotel , ate some soup , and bespoke an early dinner , walked down to the pump - room , tasted the water , and laid out some shillings in purses and spars ; thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry - cook ’s , and hurrying back to the hotel , swallowed their dinner in haste , to prevent being in the dark ; and then had a delightful drive back , only the moon was not up , and it rained a little , and Mr. Morland ’s horse was so tired he could hardly get it along .
James Morland	Your brother is the most charming of men .
James Morland	I only wish I were more worthy of him .
James Morland	Can you — can you really be in love with James ? ”
James Morland	Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James .
James Morland	Her brother and her friend engaged !
James Morland	“ You are so like your dear brother , ” continued Isabella , “ that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you .
James Morland	Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love ; for , though exceedingly fond of her brother , and partial to all his endowments , she had never in her life thought him handsome .
James Morland	“ I remember too , Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening , and wore her puce - coloured sarsenet ; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her ; I could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it .
James Morland	catherine , the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother ’s account !
James Morland	Her brother , she found , was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton , to make known his situation and ask consent ; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella .
James Morland	Catherine endeavoured to persuade her , as she was herself persuaded , that her father and mother would never oppose their son ’s wishes .
James Morland	Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . ” This charming sentiment , recommended as much by sense as novelty , gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance ; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea .
James Morland	shone out most expressively , and James could combine them with ease .
James Morland	Mrs. Thorpe , with tears of joy , embraced her daughter , her son , her visitor , and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction .
James Morland	The letter , whence sprang all this felicity , was short , containing little more than this assurance of success ; and every particular was deferred till James could write again .
James Morland	The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother ’s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in Mr. and Mrs. Allen , by the communication of the wonderful event .
James Morland	had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother ’s arrival ; and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people ’s happiness , with a remark , on the gentleman ’s side , in favour of Isabella ’s beauty , and on the lady ’s , of her great good luck .
James Morland	The disclosure , however , of the great secret of James ’s going to Fullerton the day before , did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen .
James Morland	She could not listen to that with perfect calmness , but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment , wished she could have known his intention , wished she could have seen him before he went , as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother , and her kind compliments to all the Skinners .
James Morland	“ You will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland ’s family than to my own .
James Morland	The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas — the very first moment I beheld him — my heart was irrecoverably gone .
James Morland	I remember I wore my yellow gown , with my hair done up in braids ; and when I came into the drawing - room , and John introduced him , I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before .
James Morland	Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love ; for , though exceedingly fond of her brother , and partial to all his endowments , she had never in her life thought him handsome .
James Morland	“ Morland says exactly the same , ” replied Isabella ; “ and yet I dare not expect it ; my fortune will be so small ; they never can consent to it .
James Morland	Morland says that by sending it to - night to Salisbury , we may have it to - morrow .
James Morland	Mrs. Thorpe and her son , who were acquainted with everything , and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland ’s consent , to consider Isabella ’s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family , were allowed to join their counsels , and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters .
James Morland	He not only bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world , but swore off many sentences in his praise .
James Morland	The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland ’s promise ; his honour was pledged to make everything easy ; and by what means their income was to be formed , whether landed property were to be resigned , or funded money made over , was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern .
James Morland	He made no answer ; but after a minute ’s silence burst out with , “ A famous good thing this marrying scheme , upon my soul ! a clever fancy of Morland ’s and Belle ’s
James Morland	In a private consultation between Isabella and James , the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going , and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her , it was agreed that , provided the weather were fair , the party should take place on the following morning ; and they were to set off very early , in order to be at home in good time .
James Morland	“ Catherine , you must go , ” said James .
James Morland	I dare say either of them would like to go . ”
James Morland	At one moment she was softened , at another irritated ; always distressed , but always steady . “ I did not think you had been so obstinate , Catherine , ” said James
James Morland	; “ you were not used to be so hard to persuade ; you once were the kindest , best - tempered of my sisters . ”
James Morland	Isabella ’s countenance was once more all smiles and good humour , and James too looked happy again .
James Morland	Even James was quite angry .
James Morland	Isabella , in the meanwhile , had applied her handkerchief to her eyes ; and Morland , miserable at such a sight , could not help saying , “ Nay , Catherine .
James Morland	I think you can not stand out any longer now .
James Morland	The sacrifice is not much ; and to oblige such a friend — I shall think you quite unkind , if you still refuse . ” This was the first time of her brother ’s openly siding against her , and anxious to avoid his displeasure , she proposed a compromise .
James Morland	Thorpe would have darted after her , but Morland withheld him .
James Morland	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give .
James Morland	On the strength of this , the General , soon after Eleanor ’s marriage , permitted his son to return to Northanger , and thence made him the bearer of his consent , very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland .
James Morland	I am quite uneasy about your dear brother , not having heard from him since he went to Oxford ; and am fearful of some misunderstanding .
James Morland	Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it .
James Morland	Such a contrast between him and your brother !
James Morland	I wear nothing but purple now : I know I look hideous in it , but no matter — it is your dear brother ’s favourite colour .
James Morland	Lose no time , my dearest , sweetest Catherine , in writing to him and to me , Who ever am , etc . Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine .
James Morland	“ Write to James on her behalf !
James Morland	no , James should never hear Isabella ’s name mentioned by her again . ”
James Morland	On Henry ’s arrival from Woodston , she made known to him and Eleanor their brother ’s safety , congratulating them with sincerity on it , and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation .
James Morland	I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her .
James Morland	Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ?
James Morland	mr . Morland and my brother ! ”
James Morland	’ Tis James ! ” was uttered at the same moment by Catherine ; and , on catching the young men ’s eyes , the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches , and the servant having now scampered up , the gentlemen jumped out , and the equipage was delivered to his care .
James Morland	James and Isabella led the way ; and so well
James Morland	These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening .
James Morland	Had she been older or vainer , such attacks might have done little ; but , where youth and diffidence are united , it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world , and of being so very early engaged as a partner ; and the consequence was that , when the two Morlands , after sitting an hour with the Thorpes , set off to walk together to Mr. Allen ’s , and James , as the door was closed on them , said , “ Well , Catherine , how do you like
James Morland	my friend Thorpe ?
James Morland	You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . ”
James Morland	James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , “ Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . ” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James ’s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet .
James Morland	A pre - engagement in Edgar ’s Buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend , and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other .
James Morland	She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella ’s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James .
James Morland	James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton .
James Morland	“ ’ Tis only from James , however , ” as she looked at the direction .
James Morland	You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God !
James Morland	poor James is so unhappy !
James Morland	“ To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , ” replied Henry warmly , “ must be a comfort to him under any distress . ”
James Morland	“ I have one favour to beg , ” said Catherine , shortly afterwards , in an agitated manner , “ that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . ”
James Morland	“ Our brother !
James Morland	frederick ! ”
James Morland	Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours !
James Morland	could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ” “ I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed .
James Morland	I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland ’s disappointment .
James Morland	His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable .
James Morland	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer .
James Morland	“ I do not know what I was thinking of ” ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; “ James only means to give me good advice . ”
James Morland	She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so .
James Morland	“ Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours .
James Morland	I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland ’s disappointment .
James Morland	I am very sorry for Mr. Morland — sorry that
James Morland	“ My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it .
James Morland	“ Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours .
James Morland	I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland ’s disappointment .
James Morland	I am very sorry for Mr. Morland — sorry that
James Morland	But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over .
James Morland	James was the sufferer .
James Morland	She saw him grave and uneasy ; and however careless of his present comfort
James Morland	Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable .
James Morland	She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever .
James Morland	You know she must be attached to him .
James Morland	” “ I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ” “ Oh no , not flirts .
James Morland	James was in excellent spirits , and Isabella most engagingly placid .
James Morland	Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart ; but that at such a moment was allowable ; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction , and once she drew back her hand ; but Catherine remembered Henry ’s instructions , and placed it all to judicious affection .
James Morland	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement .
James Morland	“ I doubt our being able to do so much , ” said Morland .
James Morland	In the meanwhile , they proceeded on their journey without any mischance , and were within view of the town of Keynsham , when a halloo from Morland , who was behind them , made his friend pull up , to know what was the matter .
James Morland	The others then came close enough for conversation , and Morland said , “ We had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on to - day ; your sister thinks so as well as I.
James Morland	We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street , very little more than seven miles ; and , I suppose , we have at least eight more to go .
James Morland	Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own . ”
James Morland	“ No , he is not , ” said Catherine warmly , “ for I am sure he could not afford it . ”
James Morland	“ And why can not he afford it ? ” “ Because he has not money enough . ”
James Morland	Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits ; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce , in the fate of which she shared , by private partnership with Morland , a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton .
James Morland	But I dare say , Mr. Morland , you long to be at it , do not you ?
James Morland	I am sure you do .
James Morland	Well , pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you .
James Morland	I dare say we could do very well without you ; but you men think yourselves of such consequence .
James Morland	Catherine , observing that Isabella ’s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other , as in eager expectation , and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch , thought the present a fine opportunity for being really so ; and therefore gaily said , “ Do not be uneasy , Isabella , James will soon be here .
James Morland	my dear creature , ” she replied , “ do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow .
James Morland	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement .
James Morland	At about half past twelve , a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window , and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door , in the first only a servant , her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second , before John Thorpe came running upstairs , calling out , “ Well , Miss Morland , here I am .
James Morland	“ Not expect me !
James Morland	and what a dust you would have made , if I had not come . ”
James Morland	Catherine ’s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer .
James Morland	“ My dearest creature , ” cried Isabella , to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage , “ you have been at least three hours getting ready .
James Morland	I was afraid you were ill .
James Morland	I have a thousand things to say to you ; but make haste and get in , for I long to be off . ” Catherine followed her orders and turned away , but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to James , “ What a sweet girl she is !
James Morland	i quite
James Morland	However , I am sure James does not drink so much .
James Morland	“ You do not really think , Mr. Thorpe , ” said Catherine , venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided , and to offer some little variation on the subject , “ that James ’s gig will break down ? ”
James Morland	It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure .
James Morland	and she would neither believe her own watch , nor her brother ’s , nor the servant ’s ; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality , till Morland produced his watch , and ascertained the fact ; to have doubted a moment longer _ then _ , would have been equally inconceivable , incredible , and impossible ; and she could only protest , over and over again , that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before , as Catherine was called on to confirm ; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella ; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend ’s dissenting voice , by not waiting for her answer .
James Morland	“ Yes , I went to the pump - room as soon as you were gone , and there I met her , and we had a great deal of talk together .
James Morland	and I fancy , by what I can learn , that she always dresses very handsomely .
James Morland	Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family .
James Morland	Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . ” “ And is Mr. Tilney , my partner , the only son ? ” “ I can not be quite positive about that , my dear ; I have some idea he is ; but , however , he is a very fine young man , Mrs. Hughes says , and likely to do very well .
Mrs. Thorpe	Mrs. Thorpe and her son , who were acquainted with everything , and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland ’s consent , to consider Isabella ’s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family , were allowed to join their counsels , and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters .
Mrs. Thorpe	Mrs. Thorpe , with tears of joy , embraced her daughter , her son , her visitor , and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction .
Mrs. Thorpe	Her heart was overflowing with tenderness .
Mrs. Thorpe	Mrs. Thorpe ’s being there was such a comfort to us , was not it ?
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Very true : we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe , and then we wanted for nothing .
Mrs. Thorpe	Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening , in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe , though they certainly claimed much of her leisure , as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach ; but she looked in vain .
Mrs. Thorpe	They were changed into , “ How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! ” and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families , as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be ; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe , in what they called conversation , but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion , and not often any resemblance of subject , for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children , and Mrs. Allen of her gowns .
Mrs. Thorpe	Mrs. Thorpe ’s being there was such a comfort to us , was not it ?
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Very true : we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe , and then we wanted for nothing .
Mr. Allen	20 Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend , whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion , and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased .
Mr. Allen	Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street , where she was to breakfast , and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends ; but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family , and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right , and of not being able to preserve their good opinion ,
Mr. Allen	that , in the embarrassment of the first five minutes , she could almost have wished to return with him to Pulteney Street .
Mr. Allen	The remembrance of Mr. Allen ’s opinion , respecting young men ’s open carriages , made her blush at the mention of such a plan , and her first thought was to decline it ; but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney ’s judgment ; he could not propose anything improper for her ; and , in the course of a few minutes , she found herself with Henry in the curricle , as happy a being as ever existed . A very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world ; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur , to be sure , but it was a heavy and troublesome business , and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France .
Mr. Allen	Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the General , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill - sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating - room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , “ that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ”
Mr. Allen	“ No , indeed , ” was Catherine ’s honest assurance ; “ Mr. Allen ’s dining - parlour was not more than half as large , ” and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life .
Mr. Allen	Mr. Allen ’s house , he was sure , must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness .

Mr. Allen	Mr. Allen ’s house , he was sure , must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness .
Mr. Allen	Mr. Allen , who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton , the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived , was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution — and his lady , a good - humoured woman , fond of Miss Morland , and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village , she must seek them abroad , invited her to go with them .
Mr. Allen	Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance , and Catherine all happiness .
Mr. Allen	“ Yes , very much indeed , I fancy ; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath . ”
Mr. Allen	“ I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen .
Mr. Allen	James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , “ Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . ” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James ’s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet .
Mr. Allen	The time of the two parties uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted , Catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised , restless , and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho , lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner , incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen ’s fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker , and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity , in being already engaged for the evening .
Mr. Allen	She applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of her hopes , but Mr. Allen , not having his own skies and barometer about him , declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine .
Mr. Allen	I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable .
Mr. Allen	It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump - room ; he accordingly set off by himself , and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages , containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back .
Mr. Allen	At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , “ I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back .
Mr. Allen	Yet , though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness , she cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen , which took them rather early away , and her spirits danced within her , as she danced in her chair all the way home .
Mr. Allen	A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue ; it was broken by Thorpe ’s saying very abruptly , “ Old Allen is as rich as a Jew — is not he ? ”
Mr. Allen	Catherine did not understand him — and he repeated his question , adding in explanation , “ Old Allen , the man you are with . ”
Mr. Allen	Yes , I believe , he is very rich . ”
Mr. Allen	“ A famous thing for his next heirs .
Mr. Allen	He is _ your _ godfather , is not he ? ”
Mr. Allen	He seems a good kind of old fellow enough , and has lived very well in his time , I dare say ; he is not gouty for nothing .
Mr. Allen	Does he drink his bottle a day now ? ” “ His bottle a day !
Mr. Allen	He is a very temperate man , and you could not fancy him in liquor last night ? ” “ Lord help you !
Mr. Allen	“ Yes ; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent , and there we met Mrs. Hughes , and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her . ” “ Did you indeed ?
Mr. Allen	“ And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath ? ” “ Yes , I fancy they are , but I am not quite certain .
Mr. Allen	No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen ’s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father ’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week . Here was a blow !
Mr. Allen	Mr. and Mrs. Morland , relying on the discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted
Mrs. Morland	30 Catherine ’s disposition was not naturally sedentary , nor had her habits been ever very industrious ; but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort , her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased .
Mrs. Morland	For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint ; but when a third night ’s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness , improved her in useful activity , nor given her a greater inclination for needlework , she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of , “ My dear Catherine , I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady .
Mrs. Morland	I do not know when poor Richard ’s cravats would be done , if he had no friend but you .
Mrs. Morland	After a short silence—“I hope , my Catherine , you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as Northanger .
Mrs. Morland	I did not quite like , at breakfast , to hear you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger .
Mrs. Morland	“ There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject , about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance — The Mirror , I think .
Mrs. Morland	I will look it out for you some day or other , because I am sure it will do you good . ”
Mrs. Morland	Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse ; and seeing , in her daughter ’s absent and dissatisfied look , the full proof of that repining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of cheerfulness , hastily left the room to fetch the book in question , anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady .
Mrs. Morland	It was some time before she could find what she looked for ; and other family matters occurring to detain her , a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped .
Mrs. Morland	Her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself , she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes , till , on entering the room , the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before .
Mrs. Morland	With a look of much respect , he immediately rose , and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as “ Mr. Henry Tilney , ” with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for his appearance there , acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton , and stating his impatience to be assured of Miss Morland ’s having reached her home in safety , as the cause of his intrusion .
Mrs. Morland	Far from comprehending him or his sister in their father ’s misconduct , Mrs. Morland had been always kindly disposed towards each , and instantly , pleased by his appearance , received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence ; thanking him for such an attention to her daughter , assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there , and entreating him to say not another word of the past .
Mrs. Morland	Returning in silence to his seat , therefore , he remained for some minutes most civilly answering all Mrs. Morland ’s common remarks about the weather and roads . Catherine meanwhile — the anxious , agitated , happy , feverish Catherine — said not a word ; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good - natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time , and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of The Mirror for a future hour .
Mrs. Morland	Desirous of Mr. Morland ’s assistance , as well in giving encouragement , as in finding conversation for her guest , whose embarrassment on his father ’s account she earnestly pitied , Mrs. Morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him ; but Mr. Morland was from home — and being thus without any support , at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say .
Mrs. Morland	After a couple of minutes ’ unbroken silence , Henry , turning to Catherine for the first time since her mother ’s entrance , asked her , with sudden alacrity , if Mr. and Mrs. Allen were now at Fullerton ?
Mrs. Morland	“ You may see the house from this window , sir , ” was information on Sarah ’s side , which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman , and a silencing nod from her mother ; for Mrs. Morland , thinking it probable , as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours , that he might have some explanation to give of his father ’s behaviour , which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine , would not on any account prevent her accompanying him .
Mrs. Morland	They began their walk , and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it .
Mrs. Morland	On his return from Woodston , two days before , he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland ’s departure , and ordered to think of her no more .
Mrs. Morland	The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name .
Mrs. Morland	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
Mrs. Morland	The expectations of his friend Morland , therefore , from the first overrated
Mrs. Morland	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light .
Mrs. Morland	Thorpe ’s interest in the family , by his sister ’s approaching connection with one of its members , and his own views on another ( circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness ) , seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth ; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless , of Miss Morland ’s being under their care , and — as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge — of their treating her with parental kindness .
Mrs. Morland	Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son ; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe ’s communication , he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes .
Mrs. Morland	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
Mrs. Morland	He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland , and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain , no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent , no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger , could shake his fidelity , or influence the resolutions it prompted .
Mrs. Morland	31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start .
Mrs. Morland	Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did — they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way .
Mrs. Morland	What had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family , that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it , extend an useless resentment , and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will ?
Mrs. Morland	The chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in Fullerton , the whole family were immediately at the window ; and to have it stop at the sweep - gate was a pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy — a pleasure quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children , a boy and girl of six and four years old , who expected a brother or sister in every carriage .
Mrs. Morland	Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine ’s heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible .
Mrs. Morland	in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued , and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity , they were all seated round the tea - table , which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller , whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice , before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her .
Mrs. Morland	Reluctantly , and with much hesitation , did she then begin what might perhaps , at the end of half an hour , be termed , by the courtesy of her hearers , an explanation ; but scarcely , within that time , could they at all discover the cause , or collect the particulars , of her sudden return .
Mrs. Morland	here , when the whole was unfolded , was an insult not to be overlooked , nor , for the first half hour , to be easily pardoned . Without suffering any romantic alarm , in the consideration of their daughter ’s long and lonely journey , Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her ; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered ; and that , in forcing her on such a measure , General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly — neither as a gentleman nor as a parent .
Mrs. Morland	“ My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , ” said her mother at last ; “ depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . ”
Mrs. Morland	“ My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , ” said her mother at last ; “ depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . ”
Mrs. Morland	“ I am sorry for the young people , ” returned Mrs. Morland ; “ they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General
Mrs. Morland	“ Well , ” continued her philosophic mother , “ I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done .
Mrs. Morland	It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets .
Mrs. Morland	Catherine hoped so too , and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment , but her spirits were quite worn down ; and , to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish , she readily agreed to her mother ’s next counsel of going early to bed .
Mrs. Morland	Her parents , seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified
Mrs. Morland	They never once thought of her heart , which , for the parents of a young lady of seventeen , just returned from her first excursion from home , was odd enough !
Mrs. Morland	“ This has been a strange acquaintance , ” observed Mrs. Morland , as the letter was finished ; “ soon made and soon ended .
Mrs. Morland	I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella .
Mrs. Morland	well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . ”
Mrs. Morland	“ If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy .
Mrs. Morland	Mrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation .
Mrs. Morland	her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment .

Mrs. Morland	We are sorry for him , ” said she ; “ but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ;
Mrs. Morland	Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice .
Mrs. Morland	She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked - for appearance , acting on a steady affection , would naturally call forth ; and great was their surprise , and warm their displeasure , on hearing how she had been treated — though Mrs. Morland ’s account of it was no inflated representation , no studied appeal to their passions .
Mrs. Morland	“ Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , ” said she .
Mrs. Morland	Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again !
Mrs. Morland	Mrs. Thorpe ’s being there was such a comfort to us , was not it ?
Mrs. Morland	Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable .
Mrs. Morland	I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure .
Mrs. Morland	I remember I had my favourite gown on . ”
Mrs. Morland	i do not suppose , Mrs. Morland , you ever saw a better - bred man in your life .
Mrs. Morland	As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter ’s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends .
Mrs. Morland	There was a great deal of good sense in all this ; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power ; and Catherine ’s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced .
Mrs. Morland	It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford .
Mrs. Morland	Her father , mother , Sarah , George , and Harriet , all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness , was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine ’s heart ; and in the embrace of each , as she stepped from the carriage , she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible .
Mrs. Morland	“ My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , ” said her mother at last ; “ depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . ”
Mrs. Morland	“ I am sorry for the young people , ” returned Mrs. Morland ; “ they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General

Mrs. Morland	31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start .
Mrs. Morland	“ Catherine would make a sad , heedless young housekeeper to be sure , ” was her mother ’s foreboding remark ; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice .
Mrs. Morland	Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did — they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way .
Mrs. Morland	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give .
Mrs. Morland	On the strength of this , the General , soon after Eleanor ’s marriage , permitted his son to return to Northanger , and thence made him the bearer of his consent , very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland .
Mrs. Morland	On his return from Woodston , two days before , he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland ’s departure , and ordered to think of her no more .
Mrs. Morland	The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name .
Mrs. Morland	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them .
Mrs. Morland	The expectations of his friend Morland , therefore , from the first overrated
Mrs. Morland	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light .
Mrs. Morland	Thorpe ’s interest in the family , by his sister ’s approaching connection with one of its members , and his own views on another ( circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness ) , seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth ; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless , of Miss Morland ’s being under their care , and — as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge — of their treating her with parental kindness .
Mrs. Morland	Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son ; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe ’s communication , he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes .
Mrs. Morland	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .
Mrs. Morland	He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland , and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain , no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent , no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger , could shake his fidelity , or influence the resolutions it prompted .
