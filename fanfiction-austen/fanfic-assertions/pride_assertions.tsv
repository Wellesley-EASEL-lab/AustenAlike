Character	Assertion
William Collins	The discussion of Mr. Collins ’s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .
William Collins	Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .
William Collins	Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .
William Collins	He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay .
William Collins	After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton , to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .
William Collins	He joined them on their entering the town , and attended them to their aunt ’s , where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over .
William Collins	To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _ had _ been self - imposed .
William Collins	“ I found , ” said he , “ as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .
William Collins	She highly approved his forbearance ; and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her
William Collins	His accompanying them was a double advantage : she felt all the compliment it offered to herself ; and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . [ Illustration : “ Walked back with them ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen .
William Collins	to join , with her usual cheerfulness , in the general conversation : but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave ,
William Collins	She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street , where Mr. Hurst had a house .
William Collins	The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
William Collins	I depend on you for that . ’ ”
William Collins	“ ‘ When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .
William Collins	Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter : I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that I despair .
William Collins	I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you .
William Collins	“ It is evident by this , ” added Jane , “ that he comes back no more this winter . ” “ It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . ” “ Why will you think so ?
William Collins	It must be his own doing ; he is his own master .
William Collins	I _ will _ read you the passage which particularly hurts me .
William Collins	I will have no reserves from _ you _ .
William Collins	I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
William Collins	I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
William Collins	My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister ’s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ’s heart .
William Collins	With all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ’
William Collins	Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ’s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard .
William Collins	Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .
William Collins	She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . ”
William Collins	“ Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .
William Collins	can doubt his affection ; Miss Bingley , I am sure , can not : she is not such a simpleton .
William Collins	But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ inter - marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .
William Collins	But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ”
William Collins	You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . ”
William Collins	In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation:-- “ Oh , Mr. Collins ! ”
William Collins	“ My dear madam , ” replied he , “ let us be for ever silent on this point .
William Collins	Far be it from me , ” he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , “ to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
William Collins	Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all : the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been , in early preferment ; and , I trust , I am resigned .
William Collins	Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed , that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
William Collins	You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ’s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
William Collins	My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ’s lips instead of your own ; but we are all liable to error .
William Collins	I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
William Collins	My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family ; and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologize . ”
William Collins	Mr. Darcy ’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style , and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins , in return for his last .
William Collins	Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge .
William Collins	Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .
William Collins	With many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs. Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed,-- “ Good Lord !
William Collins	Sir William , how can you tell such a story ?
William Collins	Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? ”
William Collins	Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment : but Sir William ’s good - breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
William Collins	Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .
William Collins	Mrs. Bennet was , in fact , too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
William Collins	In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and , fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
William Collins	A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her : a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude ; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
William Collins	Mr. Bennet ’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
William Collins	Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .
William Collins	Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs. Bennet ’s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
William Collins	Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
William Collins	Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .
William Collins	The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve - month ’s abode in the family might have prompted .
William Collins	After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . Mr. Collins ’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet .
William Collins	On the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
William Collins	It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .
William Collins	Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that
William Collins	Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane ’s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .
William Collins	As for Jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ’s : but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing ; and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .
William Collins	But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill - used .
William Collins	Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .
William Collins	He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and , luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company .
William Collins	The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .
William Collins	[ Illustration : “ _ Whenever she spoke in a low voice _ ” ] Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .
William Collins	Whenever Charlotte came to see them
William Collins	, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead .
William Collins	She complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
William Collins	“ Indeed , Mr. Bennet , ” said she , “ it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! ” “ My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .
William Collins	“ Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ” “ I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail .
William Collins	How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ’s own daughters I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins , too !
William Collins	Why should _ he _ have it more than anybody else ? ” “ I leave it to yourself to determine , ” said Mr. Bennet .
William Collins	I am not romantic , you know .
William Collins	I never was .
William Collins	I ask only a comfortable home ; and , considering Mr. Collins ’s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ”
William Collins	Charlotte did not stay much longer ; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
William Collins	It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
William Collins	The strangeness of Mr. Collins ’s making two offers of marriage within three days
William Collins	was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .
William Collins	She had always felt that Charlotte ’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own ; but she could not have supposed it possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .
William Collins	Charlotte , the wife of Mr. Collins , was a
William Collins	[ Illustration : “ Protested he must be entirely mistaken .
William Collins	Mr. Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance .
William Collins	The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner ; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .
William Collins	A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his right as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility .
William Collins	Having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to choose one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .
William Collins	This was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father ’s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . His plan did not vary on seeing them .
William Collins	Miss Bennet ’s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _ she _ was his settled choice .
William Collins	The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ’s _ tête - à - tête _ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on .
William Collins	Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire .
William Collins	Lydia ’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten : every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr. Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr. Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr. Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .
William Collins	In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there : his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .
William Collins	In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .
William Collins	was then no longer to be gained by _ him _ .
William Collins	Mr. Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr. Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and , he was happy to say , had accepted a commission in their corps .
William Collins	He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .
William Collins	Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger ; and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .
William Collins	Mr. Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return .
William Collins	Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips ’s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ’s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs. Philips ’s throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .
William Collins	Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces ; and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome ; and she was eagerly
William Collins	expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones ’s shopboy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield , because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane ’s introduction of him .
William Collins	Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr. Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant ’s commission in the ----shire .
William Collins	She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “ stupid , disagreeable fellows .
William Collins	the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .
William Collins	This was agreed to ; and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .
William Collins	Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured , with unwearying civility , that they were perfectly needless .
William Collins	Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips ’s manners and politeness .
William Collins	He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .
William Collins	Something , he supposed , might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .
William Collins	Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .
William Collins	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia ’s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr. Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill - will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .
William Collins	Mr. Collins ’s triumph , in consequence of this invitation , was complete .
William Collins	The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine ’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . “ I confess , ” said he , “ that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .
William Collins	I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .
William Collins	Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner , might not wholly overpower them .
William Collins	When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth,-- “ Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .
William Collins	I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more .
William Collins	” While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .
William Collins	Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company ; and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James ’s .
William Collins	Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh .
William Collins	From the entrance hall , of which Mr. Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting .
William Collins	Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .
William Collins	She was not rendered formidable by silence : but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
William Collins	, from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .
William Collins	When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small .
William Collins	After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view , Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .
William Collins	The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her Ladyship ’s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .
William Collins	He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son - in - law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .
William Collins	Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed . Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .
William Collins	In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew
William Collins	the least , and who , she observed to Mrs. Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .
William Collins	“ Your father ’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think ?
William Collins	The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours .
William Collins	“ My mother would have no objection , but my father hates London . ”
William Collins	Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe ’s calling yesterday to thank me ?
William Collins	“ You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . ” “ I am not one - and - twenty . ” When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .
William Collins	Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologizing if he thought he won too many .
William Collins	When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broken up , the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .
William Collins	From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach ; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins ’s side , and as many bows on Sir William ’s , they departed .
William Collins	But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ’s praise into his own hands .
William Collins	It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . ”
William Collins	Pray do not talk of that odious man .
William Collins	They had often attempted it before : but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .
William Collins	“ It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ” “ No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .
William Collins	Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? ” “ Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . ” / * RIGHT “ Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , _ 15th October _ .
William Collins	“ At four o’clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , ” said Mr. Bennet , as he folded up the letter .
William Collins	“ He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and , I doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . ”
William Collins	“ There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however ; and , if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . ”
William Collins	“ Though it is difficult , ” said Jane , “ to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . ”
William Collins	Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .
William Collins	“ He must be an oddity , I think , ” said she .
William Collins	“ I can not make him out .
William Collins	is something very pompous in his style .
William Collins	And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?
William Collins	We can not suppose he would help it , if he could .
William Collins	Can he be a sensible man , sir ? ”
William Collins	I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .
William Collins	There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter which promises well .
William Collins	I am impatient to see him . ”
William Collins	“ In point of composition , ” said Mary , “ his letter does not seem defective .
William Collins	It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .
William Collins	As for their mother , Mr. Collins ’s letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters .
William Collins	Mr. Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .
William Collins	Mr. Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .
William Collins	He was a tall , heavy - looking young man of five - and - twenty .
William Collins	His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .
William Collins	He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .
William Collins	This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily,-- “ You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .
William Collins	“ Ah , sir , I do indeed .
William Collins	At present I will not say more , but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted---- ” He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .
William Collins	They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins ’s admiration .
William Collins	The hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture , were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet ’s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .
William Collins	and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing .
William Collins	But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet , who assured him , with some asperity , that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .
William Collins	He begged pardon for having displeased her .
William Collins	In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour .
William Collins	XXXIX . It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ---- , in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet ’s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ’s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room upstairs .
William Collins	I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .
William Collins	Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .
William Collins	how ashamed I should be of not being married before three - and - twenty !
William Collins	My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands you ca n’t think .
William Collins	She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but _ I _ do not think there would have been any fun in it .
William Collins	how I should like to be married before any of you !
William Collins	and then I would _ chaperon _ you about to all the balls .
William Collins	Dear me !
William Collins	Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by - the - bye , Mrs. Forster and me are _ such _ friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come :
William Collins	Not a soul knew of it , but Colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked !
William Collins	how I laughed !
William Collins	I thought I should have died .
William Collins	Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,---- “ I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . ”
William Collins	In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .
Elizabeth Bennet	The discussion of Mr. Collins ’s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .
Elizabeth Bennet	As for the gentleman himself , _ his _ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
Elizabeth Bennet	He scarcely ever spoke to her ; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
Elizabeth Bennet	The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet ’s ill humour or ill health .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .
Elizabeth Bennet	To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _ had _ been self - imposed .
Elizabeth Bennet	She highly approved his forbearance ; and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her
Elizabeth Bennet	His accompanying them was a double advantage : she felt all the compliment it offered to herself ; and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . [ Illustration : “ Walked back with them ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen .
Elizabeth Bennet	_ ] ] Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .
Elizabeth Bennet	The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot - pressed paper , well covered with a lady ’s fair , flowing hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ’s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
Elizabeth Bennet	to join , with her usual cheerfulness , in the general conversation : but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave ,
Elizabeth Bennet	than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs .
Elizabeth Bennet	You shall hear what she says . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street , where Mr. Hurst had a house .
Elizabeth Bennet	The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
Elizabeth Bennet	I depend on you for that . ’ ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament : it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley ’s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his . “ It is unlucky , ” said she , after a short pause , “ that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
Elizabeth Bennet	But may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .
Elizabeth Bennet	I will read it to you .
Elizabeth Bennet	Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter : I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that I despair .
Elizabeth Bennet	I will have no reserves from _ you _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
Elizabeth Bennet	Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ’s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard .
Elizabeth Bennet	Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
Elizabeth Bennet	Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . ” “ That is right .
Elizabeth Bennet	You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine : believe her to be deceived , by all means .
Elizabeth Bennet	You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ” “ You must decide for yourself , ” said Elizabeth ; “ and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you , by all means , to refuse him . ” “ How can you talk so ? ” said Jane , faintly smiling ; “ you must know , that , though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . ” “ I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . ” “ But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .
Elizabeth Bennet	The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .
Elizabeth Bennet	It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline ’s interested wishes ; and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone .
Elizabeth Bennet	She represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . Jane ’s temper was not desponding ; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart .
Elizabeth Bennet	They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ’s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern ,
Elizabeth Bennet	and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together .
Elizabeth Bennet	After lamenting it , however , at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again , and soon dining at Longbourn ; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .
Elizabeth Bennet	Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
Elizabeth Bennet	In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation:-- “ Oh , Mr. Collins ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dear madam , ” replied he , “ let us be for ever silent on this point .
Elizabeth Bennet	Far be it from me , ” he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , “ to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ’s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
Elizabeth Bennet	My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ’s lips instead of your own ; but we are all liable to error .
Elizabeth Bennet	My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family ; and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologize . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	The discussion of Mr. Collins ’s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .
Elizabeth Bennet	After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton , to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .
Elizabeth Bennet	His accompanying them was a double advantage : she felt all the compliment it offered to herself ; and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . [ Illustration : “ Walked back with them ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen .
Elizabeth Bennet	I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
Elizabeth Bennet	What think you of _ this _ sentence , my dear Lizzy ? ” said Jane , as she finished it .
Elizabeth Bennet	Far be it from me , ” he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , “ to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ’s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
Elizabeth Bennet	My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ’s lips instead of your own ; but we are all liable to error .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It is from Miss Bingley , ” said Jane , and then read it aloud .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That would be a good scheme , ” said Elizabeth , “ if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But if you have got them to - day , ” said Elizabeth , “ my mother ’s purpose will be answered .
Elizabeth Bennet	She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged ; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .
Elizabeth Bennet	Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:-- / * NIND “ My dearest Lizzie , * / “ I find myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .
Elizabeth Bennet	My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .
Elizabeth Bennet	They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , my dear , ” said Mr. Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , “ if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , I am not at all afraid of her dying .
Elizabeth Bennet	She will be taken good care of .
Elizabeth Bennet	As long as she stays there , it is all very well .
Elizabeth Bennet	I would go and see her if I could have the carriage .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had : and as she was no horsewoman , walking was her only alternative .
Elizabeth Bennet	She declared her resolution .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How can you be so silly , ” cried her mother , “ as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !
Elizabeth Bennet	You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ We will go as far as Meryton with you , ” said Catherine and Lydia .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .
Elizabeth Bennet	In Meryton they parted : the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ’ wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles , with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was shown into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .
Elizabeth Bennet	That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ’s manners there was something better than politeness -- there was good - humour and kindness .
Elizabeth Bennet	The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion ’s justifying her coming so far alone .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish , and not well enough to leave her room .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit ,
Elizabeth Bennet	was delighted at her entrance .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth silently attended her .
Elizabeth Bennet	When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane .
Elizabeth Bennet	The apothecary came ; and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .
Elizabeth Bennet	The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .
Elizabeth Bennet	When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go , and very unwillingly said so .
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only
Elizabeth Bennet	wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was despatched to Longbourn , to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .
Elizabeth Bennet	You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . ” He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner ; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed along .
Elizabeth Bennet	[ Illustration : “ A note for Miss Bennet ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .
Elizabeth Bennet	The day of his and Lydia ’s departure soon came ; and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , my dear Lydia , ” she cried , “ when shall we meet again ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	I do n’t know .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Write to me very often , my dear . ” “ As often as I can .
Elizabeth Bennet	But you know married women have never much time for writing .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Wickham ’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ’s .
Elizabeth Bennet	The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days . “ I often think , ” said she , “ that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ’s friends .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ This is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , ” said Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ’s regiment happens to be so far off .
Elizabeth Bennet	But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news which then began to be in circulation .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets .
Elizabeth Bennet	She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head , by turns .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , ” ( for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news ) .
Elizabeth Bennet	Not that I care about it , though .
Elizabeth Bennet	He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You may depend on it , ” replied the other , “ for Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton last night : I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certainly true .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was going to the butcher ’s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said,-- “ I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed ; but do n’t imagine it was from any silly cause .
Elizabeth Bennet	I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I _ should _ be looked at .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .
Elizabeth Bennet	Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people ’s remarks . ” Elizabeth did not know what to make of it .
Elizabeth Bennet	Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _ with _ his friend ’s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yet it is hard , ” she sometimes thought , “ that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !
Elizabeth Bennet	I _ will _ leave him to himself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .
Elizabeth Bennet	They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ you will wait on him , of course . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .
Elizabeth Bennet	His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . “ ’ Tis an _ etiquette _ I despise , ” said he .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , however , that sha n’t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .
Elizabeth Bennet	Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ’s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley , in consequence of it , before _ they _ did .
Elizabeth Bennet	As the day of his arrival drew near,-- “ I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , ” said Jane to her sister .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference ; but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .
Elizabeth Bennet	My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says .
Elizabeth Bennet	Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I wish I could say anything to comfort you , ” replied Elizabeth ; “ but it is wholly out of my power .
Elizabeth Bennet	You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet , through the assistance of servants ,
Elizabeth Bennet	contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could .
Elizabeth Bennet	She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent -- hopeless of seeing him before .
Elizabeth Bennet	But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked -- she saw Mr. Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . “ There is a gentleman with him , mamma , ” said Kitty ; “ who can it be ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ La ! ” replied Kitty , “ it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .
Elizabeth Bennet	She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .
Elizabeth Bennet	But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner ’s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .
Elizabeth Bennet	To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merits she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .
Elizabeth Bennet	The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken ; but she would not be secure .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Let me first see how he behaves , ” said she ; “ it will then be early enough for expectation . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected .
Elizabeth Bennet	On the gentlemen ’s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .
Elizabeth Bennet	He looked serious as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , perhaps , he could not in her mother ’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .
Elizabeth Bennet	Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .
Elizabeth Bennet	He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .
Elizabeth Bennet	Darcy , after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did -- a question which she could not answer without confusion -- said scarcely anything .
Elizabeth Bennet	He was not seated by her : perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire .
Elizabeth Bennet	There he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Could I expect it to be otherwise ? ” said she .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .
Elizabeth Bennet	She inquired after his sister , but could do no more . “ It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , ” said Mrs. Bennet .
Elizabeth Bennet	He readily agreed to it . “ I began to be afraid you would never come back again .
Elizabeth Bennet	People _ did _ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true .
Elizabeth Bennet	A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away .
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Lucas is married and settled : and one of my own daughters .
Elizabeth Bennet	I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was in the ‘ Times ’ and the ‘ Courier , ’ I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was my brother Gardiner ’s drawing up , too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .
Elizabeth Bennet	How Mr. Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , ” continued her mother ; “ but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken away from me .
Elizabeth Bennet	His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the Regulars .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy , was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat .
Elizabeth Bennet	It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , ” said her mother , “ I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet ’s manor .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth ’s misery increased at such unnecessary , such officious attention !
Elizabeth Bennet	Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , everything , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .
Elizabeth Bennet	At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion . “ The first wish of my heart , ” said she to herself , “ is never more to be in company with either of them .
Elizabeth Bennet	Let me never see either one or the other again ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover .
Elizabeth Bennet	When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good - natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever ; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days ’ time .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , ” she added ; “ for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned .
Elizabeth Bennet	I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , my dear Lydia , ” she cried , “ when shall we meet again ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said,-- “ I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed ; but do n’t imagine it was from any silly cause .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .
Elizabeth Bennet	I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .
Elizabeth Bennet	I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though , perhaps , it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do .
Elizabeth Bennet	So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart .
Elizabeth Bennet	was then gratified : he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire ; and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet ’s being quite unable to sit alone .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ’ beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .
Elizabeth Bennet	As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
Elizabeth Bennet	He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and , in spite of everything , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .
Elizabeth Bennet	The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .
Elizabeth Bennet	The letter was to this effect:-- / * “ My dear Lizzy , * / “ I wish you joy .
Elizabeth Bennet	If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .
Elizabeth Bennet	It is a great comfort to have you so rich ; and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .
Elizabeth Bennet	As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind .
Elizabeth Bennet	Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses , she frequently sent them .
Elizabeth Bennet	It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .
Elizabeth Bennet	His affection for her soon sunk into indifference : hers lasted a little longer ; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Though Darcy could never receive _ him _ at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ’s sake , he assisted him further in his profession .
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ’s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropped all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility
Elizabeth Bennet	to Elizabeth
Elizabeth Bennet	Pemberley was now Georgiana ’s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .
Elizabeth Bennet	Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive manner of talking to her brother .
Elizabeth Bennet	He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .
Elizabeth Bennet	By Elizabeth ’s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .
Elizabeth Bennet	But at length , by Elizabeth ’s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .
Elizabeth Bennet	Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .
Elizabeth Bennet	But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner ’s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- “ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write .
Elizabeth Bennet	But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err .
Elizabeth Bennet	I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes .
Elizabeth Bennet	How could I be so silly as to wish it !
Elizabeth Bennet	I am the happiest creature in the world .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me .
Elizabeth Bennet	/ * “ Dear Sir , * / “ I must trouble you once more for congratulations .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Bingley ’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere .
Elizabeth Bennet	She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .
Elizabeth Bennet	Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge .
Elizabeth Bennet	At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth
Elizabeth Bennet	did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .
Elizabeth Bennet	The letter was to this effect:-- / * “ My dear Lizzy , * / “ I wish you joy .
Elizabeth Bennet	If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .
Elizabeth Bennet	It is a great comfort to have you so rich ; and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .
Elizabeth Bennet	Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Next time you call , ” said she , “ I hope we shall be more lucky . ” He should be particularly happy at any time , etc . , etc . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .
Elizabeth Bennet	Yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .
Elizabeth Bennet	In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters ’ room , in her dressing - gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out,-- “ My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down .
Elizabeth Bennet	Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .
Elizabeth Bennet	where is your sash , my dear ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	being thus removed , Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , “ What is the matter , mamma ?
Elizabeth Bennet	What do you keep winking at me for ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Nothing , child , nothing .
Elizabeth Bennet	I did not wink at you . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty,-- “ Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , ” took her out of the room
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that _ she _ would not give in to it .
Elizabeth Bennet	, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,-- “ Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was forced to go .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ We may as well leave them by themselves , you know , ” said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . “ Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . ” Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet ’s schemes for this day were ineffectual .
Elizabeth Bennet	Bingley was everything that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet ’s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .
Elizabeth Bennet	Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time .
Elizabeth Bennet	Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ’s concurrence .
Elizabeth Bennet	Bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .
Elizabeth Bennet	Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet ’s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , who had a letter to write
Elizabeth Bennet	; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ’s schemes .
Elizabeth Bennet	But on her returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .
Elizabeth Bennet	On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all .
Elizabeth Bennet	_ Their _ situation was awkward enough ; but _ hers _ she thought was still worse .
Elizabeth Bennet	Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and , whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and , instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ ’ Tis too much ! ” she added , “ by far too much .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do not deserve it .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth ’s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .
Elizabeth Bennet	But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I must go instantly to my mother , ” she cried .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude , or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself .
Elizabeth Bennet	He is gone to my father already .
Elizabeth Bennet	Oh , Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !
Elizabeth Bennet	how shall I bear so much happiness ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card - party , and was sitting upstairs with Kitty .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . “ And this , ” said she , “ is the end of all his friend ’s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ’s falsehood and contrivance !
Elizabeth Bennet	In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Where is your sister ? ” said he hastily , as he opened the door .
Elizabeth Bennet	She will be down in a moment , I dare say . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	He then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .
Elizabeth Bennet	They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of Jane ’s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was .
Elizabeth Bennet	You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . ” “ I hope not so .
Elizabeth Bennet	Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _ me _ . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	My dear Mr. Bennet , ” cried his wife , “ what are you talking of ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Then addressing her daughter , “ Oh , my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !
Elizabeth Bennet	At that moment she cared for no other .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else : but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .
Elizabeth Bennet	In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He has made me so happy , ” said she , one evening , “ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I suspected as much , ” replied Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .
Elizabeth Bennet	But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That is the most unforgiving speech , ” said Elizabeth , “ that I ever heard you utter .
Elizabeth Bennet	Good girl !
Elizabeth Bennet	It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley ’s pretended regard . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ” “ He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy !
Elizabeth Bennet	If there were but such another man for you ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you .
Elizabeth Bennet	Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .
Elizabeth Bennet	The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was Elizabeth ’s intimate friend .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Upon my word !
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I beg you will not put it into Lizzy ’s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do not believe a word of it , my dear .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That is very true , ” replied Elizabeth , “ and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would ; and the argument ended only with the visit .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .
Elizabeth Bennet	With many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs. Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed,-- “ Good Lord !
Elizabeth Bennet	Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was , in fact , too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
Elizabeth Bennet	In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and , fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
Elizabeth Bennet	Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
Elizabeth Bennet	Nothing could console and nothing appease her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Nor did that day wear out her resentment .
Elizabeth Bennet	A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her : a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude ; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Bennet ’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match : but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Elizabeth Bennet	Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs. Bennet ’s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
Elizabeth Bennet	Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
Elizabeth Bennet	After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . Mr. Collins ’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet .
Elizabeth Bennet	On the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
Elizabeth Bennet	She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .
Elizabeth Bennet	Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley ’s continued absence .
Elizabeth Bennet	Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
Elizabeth Bennet	Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that
Elizabeth Bennet	Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane ’s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .
Elizabeth Bennet	The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters , and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
Elizabeth Bennet	As for Jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ’s : but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing ; and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .
Elizabeth Bennet	But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill - used .
Elizabeth Bennet	[ Illustration : “ _ Whenever she spoke in a low voice _ ” ] Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .
Elizabeth Bennet	The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill - humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .
Elizabeth Bennet	The sight of Miss Lucas
Elizabeth Bennet	was odious to her .
Elizabeth Bennet	As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .
Elizabeth Bennet	, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead .
Elizabeth Bennet	She complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Indeed , Mr. Bennet , ” said she , “ it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! ” “ My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .
Elizabeth Bennet	Let us flatter ourselves that _ I _ may be the survivor . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet ; and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I can not bear to think that they should have all this estate .
Elizabeth Bennet	If it was not for the entail , I should not mind it . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What should not you mind ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I should not mind anything at all . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ” “ I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail .
Elizabeth Bennet	How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ’s own daughters I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins , too !
Elizabeth Bennet	Why should _ he _ have it more than anybody else ? ” “ I leave it to yourself to determine , ” said Mr. Bennet .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am not romantic , you know .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth quietly answered “ undoubtedly ; ” and , after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .
Elizabeth Bennet	Charlotte did not stay much longer ; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
Elizabeth Bennet	On finding Mrs. Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words,-- “ May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise , Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,--
Elizabeth Bennet	I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection .
Elizabeth Bennet	And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out,-- “ Dear ma’am , do not go .
Elizabeth Bennet	I beg you will not go .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Collins must excuse me .
Elizabeth Bennet	He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am going away myself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , no , nonsense , Lizzy .
Elizabeth Bennet	I desire you will stay where you are . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	And upon Elizabeth ’s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , “ Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction ; and a moment ’s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal , by incessant employment , the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Collins began,-- “ Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth ,
Elizabeth Bennet	that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .
Elizabeth Bennet	You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have
Elizabeth Bennet	your respected mother ’s permission for this address
Elizabeth Bennet	You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to
Elizabeth Bennet	Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .
Elizabeth Bennet	But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . ” The idea of Mr. Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued,-- “ My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .
Elizabeth Bennet	Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .
Elizabeth Bennet	You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .
Elizabeth Bennet	Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .
Elizabeth Bennet	But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters ,
Elizabeth Bennet	that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I
Elizabeth Bennet	flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .
Elizabeth Bennet	And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .
Elizabeth Bennet	To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother ’s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .
Elizabeth Bennet	On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are too hasty , sir , ” she cried .
Elizabeth Bennet	Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . ” “ I am not now to learn , ” replied Mr. Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , “ that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am , therefore , by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Upon my word , sir , ” cried Elizabeth , “ your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am perfectly serious in my refusal .
Elizabeth Bennet	You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _ you _ so .
Elizabeth Bennet	Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .
Elizabeth Bennet	” “ Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , ” said Mr. Collins , very gravely--“but I can not imagine that her Ladyship would at all disapprove of you .
Elizabeth Bennet	And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Indeed , Mr. Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .
Elizabeth Bennet	You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .
Elizabeth Bennet	I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .
Elizabeth Bennet	In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach .
Elizabeth Bennet	And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,-- “ When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Really , Mr. Collins , ” cried Elizabeth , with some warmth , “ you puzzle me exceedingly .
Elizabeth Bennet	If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement
Elizabeth Bennet	, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course .
Elizabeth Bennet	My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration that , in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .
Elizabeth Bennet	I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .
Elizabeth Bennet	I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
Elizabeth Bennet	My feelings in every respect forbid it .
Elizabeth Bennet	Can I speak plainer ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ” “ You are uniformly charming ! ” cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; “ and I am persuaded that , when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .
Elizabeth Bennet	To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . ” “ I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , ” he coldly replied .
Elizabeth Bennet	She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree ; for in Darcy ’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against
Elizabeth Bennet	They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and , with an expression of civil disdain , thus accosted her,-- “ So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy ’s steward .
Elizabeth Bennet	Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner .
Elizabeth Bennet	I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ’s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ His guilt and his descent appear , by your account , to be the same , ” said Elizabeth , angrily
Elizabeth Bennet	; “ for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy ’s steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I beg your pardon , ” replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Excuse my interference ; it was kindly meant . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Insolent girl ! ” said Elizabeth to herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
Elizabeth Bennet	I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth instantly read her feelings ; and , at that moment , solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and everything else , gave way before the hope of Jane ’s being in the fairest way for happiness . “ I want to know , ” said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ’s , “ what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham .
Elizabeth Bennet	But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person , in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , ” replied Jane , “ I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy ’s regard . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	I am perfectly satisfied .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley ’s sincerity , ” said Elizabeth warmly , “ but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Bingley ’s defence of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . ” She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ’s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
Elizabeth Bennet	On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Elizabeth Bennet	Who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !
Elizabeth Bennet	I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
Elizabeth Bennet	My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ” “ You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ? ” “ Indeed I am .
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .
Elizabeth Bennet	I believe him to be Lady Catherine ’s _ nephew _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr. Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus,-- “ My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
Elizabeth Bennet	You must , therefore , allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which lead me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .
Elizabeth Bennet	Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ; ” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words “ apology , ” “ Hunsford , ” and “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have no reason , I assure you , ” said he , “ to be dissatisfied with my reception .
Elizabeth Bennet	” As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .
Elizabeth Bennet	She saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ’s two sisters .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her mother ’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
Elizabeth Bennet	When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley .
Elizabeth Bennet	His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Elizabeth Bennet	She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
Elizabeth Bennet	In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ’s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ For heaven ’s sake , madam , speak lower .
Elizabeth Bennet	Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
Elizabeth Bennet	She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth now began to revive .
Elizabeth Bennet	But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
Elizabeth Bennet	did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth ’s eyes were fixed on her , with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was in agonies .
Elizabeth Bennet	She looked at Jane to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .
Elizabeth Bennet	She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued , however , impenetrably grave .
Elizabeth Bennet	She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her father ’s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Elizabeth Bennet	Many stared -- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed , in a half - whisper to Lady
Elizabeth Bennet	To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough ; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Elizabeth Bennet	The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was teased by Mr. Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side ; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .
Elizabeth Bennet	In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
Elizabeth Bennet	He assured her that , as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend himself to her ; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . There was no arguing upon such a project .
Elizabeth Bennet	She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good - naturedly engaged Mr. Collins ’s conversation to herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy ’s further notice : though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
Elizabeth Bennet	She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham , and rejoiced in it .
Elizabeth Bennet	The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
Elizabeth Bennet	They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation , and , by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins , who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Elizabeth Bennet	Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _ her _ , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield . [ Illustration : “ to assure you in the most animated language ” ]
Elizabeth Bennet	Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five - and - twenty years ago . “ I am sure , ” said she , “ I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller ’s regiment went away .
Elizabeth Bennet	I thought I should have broke my heart .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If one could but go to Brighton ! ” observed Mrs. Bennet .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . ” “ And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good , ” added Kitty .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .
Elizabeth Bennet	She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy ’s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
Elizabeth Bennet	In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .
Elizabeth Bennet	As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her , were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .
Elizabeth Bennet	She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia ’s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
Elizabeth Bennet	He heard her attentively , and then said,-- “ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If you were aware , ” said Elizabeth , “ of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ’s unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ” “ Already arisen ! ” repeated Mr. Bennet .
Elizabeth Bennet	Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ’s folly . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Indeed , you are mistaken .
Elizabeth Bennet	I have no such injuries to resent .
Elizabeth Bennet	It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining .
Elizabeth Bennet	Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly .
Elizabeth Bennet	If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .
Elizabeth Bennet	Oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?
Elizabeth Bennet	” Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and , affectionately taking her hand , said , in reply,-- “ Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .
Elizabeth Bennet	Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say , three -- very silly sisters .
Elizabeth Bennet	At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ” With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations by dwelling on them .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was confident of having performed her duty ; and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .
Elizabeth Bennet	Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .
Elizabeth Bennet	have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time .
Elizabeth Bennet	Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .
Elizabeth Bennet	In his present behaviour to herself
Elizabeth Bennet	, moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure ; for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .
Elizabeth Bennet	She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured , at any time , by their renewal . On the very last day of the regiment ’s remaining in Meryton , he dined , with others of the officers , at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good - humour , that , on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s and Mr. Darcy ’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .
Elizabeth Bennet	He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but , with a moment ’s recollection , and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her answer was warmly in his favour .
Elizabeth Bennet	With an air of indifference , he soon afterwards added , “ How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? ” “ Nearly three weeks . ” “ And you saw him frequently ? ” “ Yes , almost every day . ” “ His manners are very different from his cousin ’s . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , very different ; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . ” “ Indeed ! ” cried Wickham , with a look which did not escape her .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , no ! ” said Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning .
Elizabeth Bennet	There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added,-- “ When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .
Elizabeth Bennet	” Wickham ’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents,-- “ You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right .
Elizabeth Bennet	” Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .
Elizabeth Bennet	She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .
Elizabeth Bennet	The rest of the evening passed with the _ appearance _ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and , in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .
Elizabeth Bennet	_ I _ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	More than once did Elizabeth , in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy .
Elizabeth Bennet	She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and , to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him , at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .
Elizabeth Bennet	It seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance ; for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Elizabeth Bennet	He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins ’s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings , and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _ there _ too .
Elizabeth Bennet	She supposed , if he meant anything , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .
Elizabeth Bennet	It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was engaged one day , as she walked , in re - perusing Jane ’s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy , she saw , on looking up , that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Putting away the letter immediately , and forcing a smile , she said,-- “ I did not know before that you ever walked this way . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Are you going much farther ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , I should have turned in a moment . ” And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? ” said she .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy .
Elizabeth Bennet	A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ?
Elizabeth Bennet	When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Younger sons can not marry where they like . ” “ Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Is this , ” thought Elizabeth , “ meant for me ? ” and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , “ And pray , what is the usual price of an earl ’s younger son ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .
Elizabeth Bennet	To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said,-- “ I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .
Elizabeth Bennet	I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . ” “ Are you , indeed ?
Elizabeth Bennet	And pray what sort of a guardian do you make ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Does your charge give you much trouble ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ” As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly ; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
Elizabeth Bennet	She directly replied,--
Elizabeth Bennet	I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
Elizabeth Bennet	great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley
Elizabeth Bennet	I think I have heard you say that you know them . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I know them a little .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh yes , ” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Yes , I really believe Darcy _ does _ take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
Elizabeth Bennet	From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him .
Elizabeth Bennet	But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ’s family it would be an unpleasant thing . ” “ You may depend upon my not mentioning it . ” “ And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .
Elizabeth Bennet	What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars ; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ” “ And what arts did he use to separate them ? ” “ He did not talk to me of his own arts , ” said Fitzwilliam , smiling .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He only told me what I have now told you . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .
Elizabeth Bennet	After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am thinking of what you have been telling me , ” said she .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your cousin ’s conduct does not suit my feelings .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ’s inclination ; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , ” she continued , recollecting herself , “ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Elizabeth Bennet	This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the Parsonage .
Elizabeth Bennet	There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
Elizabeth Bennet	That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ To Jane herself , ” she exclaimed , “ there could be no possibility of objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is !
Elizabeth Bennet	Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	When she thought of her mother , indeed , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections _ there _ had material weight with Mr. Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ’s connections than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister .
Elizabeth Bennet	The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Elizabeth Bennet	seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ’s being rather displeased by her staying at home .
Elizabeth Bennet	When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room , where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .
Elizabeth Bennet	He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation ; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was “ very glad ; ” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley ’s salutation .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards , and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .
Elizabeth Bennet	She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs. Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ’s conversation with Miss Bennet .
Elizabeth Bennet	She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when , hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said,-- “ By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If you mean Darcy , ” cried her brother , “ he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I should like balls infinitely better , ” she replied , “ if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say ; but it would not be near so much like a ball . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	In the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said,-- “ Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .
Elizabeth Bennet	I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .
Elizabeth Bennet	He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him .
Elizabeth Bennet	How shall we punish him for such a speech ? ” “ Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , ” said Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . ” “ But upon my honour I do _ not _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	No , no ; I feel he may defy us there .
Elizabeth Bennet	And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy may hug himself . ” “ Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! ” cried Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintance .
Elizabeth Bennet	I dearly love a laugh . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	The wisest and best of men,--nay , the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . ” “ Certainly , ” replied Elizabeth , “ there are such people , but I hope I am not one of _ them _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good .
Elizabeth Bennet	Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _ do _ divert me , I own , and I
Elizabeth Bennet	laugh at them whenever I can .
Elizabeth Bennet	But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . ” “ Perhaps that is not possible for anyone .
Elizabeth Bennet	But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . ” “ Such as vanity and pride . ” “ Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , ” said Miss Bingley ; “ and pray what is the result ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ _ That _ is a failing , indeed ! ” cried Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	But you have chosen your fault well .
Elizabeth Bennet	I really can not _ laugh _ at it .
Elizabeth Bennet	You are safe from me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . ” “ And _ your _ defect is a propensity to hate everybody . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Bingley saw , or suspected , enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .
Elizabeth Bennet	And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ” [ Illustration : “ No , no ; stay where you are ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _
Elizabeth Bennet	] “ Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? ” “ Oh yes .
Elizabeth Bennet	As for your Elizabeth ’s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?
Elizabeth Bennet	At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I did not know that you intended to walk , ” said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You used us abominably ill , ” answered Mrs. Hurst , “ running away without telling us that you were coming out . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered,-- “ No , no ; stay where you are .
Elizabeth Bennet	She then ran gaily off , rejoicing , as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ’s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .
Elizabeth Bennet	In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .
Elizabeth Bennet	She would not listen , therefore , to her daughter ’s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .
Elizabeth Bennet	Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Indeed I have , sir , ” was her answer .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ She is a great deal too ill to be moved .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her .
Elizabeth Bennet	My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You may depend upon it , madam , ” said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , “ that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am sure , ” she added , “ if it was not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception ,
Elizabeth Bennet	I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _ her _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . ” “ That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , ” said Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You begin to comprehend me , do you ? ” cried he , turning towards her .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh yes -- I understand you perfectly . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through , I am afraid , is pitiful . ” “ That is as it happens .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lizzy , ” cried her mother , “ remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . ” “ I did not know before , ” continued Bingley , immediately , “ that you were a studier of character .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Ay , that is because you have the right disposition .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , ” said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother .
Elizabeth Bennet	Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance .
Elizabeth Bennet	His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ’s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _ her _ coming away .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And so ended his affection , ” said Elizabeth , impatiently .
Elizabeth Bennet	been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .
Elizabeth Bennet	I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .
Elizabeth Bennet	She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .
Elizabeth Bennet	She performed her part , indeed , without much graciousness , but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball .
Elizabeth Bennet	But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ? ” Lydia declared herself satisfied .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _ her _ , in spite of all Miss Bingley ’s witticisms on _ fine eyes _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .
Elizabeth Bennet	She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened : it was impossible to think of anything else ; and , totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr. Darcy ’s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road .
Elizabeth Bennet	The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
Elizabeth Bennet	After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .
Elizabeth Bennet	The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park : he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy
Elizabeth Bennet	, she was directly retreating .
Elizabeth Bennet	But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had turned away ; but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .
Elizabeth Bennet	He had by that time reached it also ; and , holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said , with a look of haughty composure , “ I have been walking in the grove some time , in the hope of meeting you .
Elizabeth Bennet	Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	With no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .
Elizabeth Bennet	Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was dated from Rosings , at eight o’clock in the morning , and was as follows:-- “ Be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .
Elizabeth Bennet	I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .
Elizabeth Bennet	You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .
Elizabeth Bennet	The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham .
Elizabeth Bennet	Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .
Elizabeth Bennet	But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .
Elizabeth Bennet	If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , I can only say that I am sorry .
Elizabeth Bennet	I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country .
Elizabeth Bennet	But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .
Elizabeth Bennet	I had often seen him in love before .
Elizabeth Bennet	At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you
Elizabeth Bennet	, I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ’s accidental information , that Bingley ’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .
Elizabeth Bennet	From that moment I observed my friend ’s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .
Elizabeth Bennet	Your sister I also watched .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard ; and I remained convinced , from the evening ’s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
Elizabeth Bennet	If _ you _ have not been mistaken here , _ I _ must have been in an error .
Elizabeth Bennet	Your superior knowledge of your sister
Elizabeth Bennet	If it be so , if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
Elizabeth Bennet	But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
Elizabeth Bennet	That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
Elizabeth Bennet	I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason .
Elizabeth Bennet	My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
Elizabeth Bennet	But there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .
Elizabeth Bennet	The situation of your mother ’s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend you . But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
Elizabeth Bennet	I will only say , farther , that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection .
Elizabeth Bennet	He left Netherfield for London on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .
Elizabeth Bennet	The part which I acted is now to be explained .
Elizabeth Bennet	His sisters ’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own : our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London .
Elizabeth Bennet	We accordingly went -- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice .
Elizabeth Bennet	I described and enforced them earnestly .
Elizabeth Bennet	But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance , which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ’s indifference .
Elizabeth Bennet	But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .
Elizabeth Bennet	I can not blame myself for having done thus much .
Elizabeth Bennet	There is but one part of my conduct , in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ’s being in town .
Elizabeth Bennet	I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Elizabeth Bennet	That they might have met without ill consequence is , perhaps , probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
Elizabeth Bennet	Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .
Elizabeth Bennet	On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .
Elizabeth Bennet	If I have wounded your sister ’s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient
Elizabeth Bennet	, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .
Elizabeth Bennet	Of what he has _ particularly _ accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ’s education .
Elizabeth Bennet	My father was not only fond of this young man ’s society , whose manners were always engaging , he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
Elizabeth Bennet	As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .
Elizabeth Bennet	Here again I shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell .
Elizabeth Bennet	But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .
Elizabeth Bennet	My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant .
Elizabeth Bennet	His own father did not long survive mine ; and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .
Elizabeth Bennet	He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .
Elizabeth Bennet	I rather wished than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .
Elizabeth Bennet	I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman .
Elizabeth Bennet	I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .
Elizabeth Bennet	In town , I believe , he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence ; and being
Elizabeth Bennet	For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
Elizabeth Bennet	His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
Elizabeth Bennet	He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father ’s intentions .
Elizabeth Bennet	You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
Elizabeth Bennet	His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself .
Elizabeth Bennet	How he lived , I know not .
Elizabeth Bennet	But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Elizabeth Bennet	I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .
Elizabeth Bennet	My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ’s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .
Elizabeth Bennet	a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child ,
Elizabeth Bennet	that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement
Elizabeth Bennet	She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement ; and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father
Elizabeth Bennet	, acknowledged the whole to me .
Elizabeth Bennet	You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .
Elizabeth Bennet	Regard for my sister ’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Wickham ’s chief object was unquestionably my sister ’s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement .
Elizabeth Bennet	This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham .
Elizabeth Bennet	I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood , he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at , ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either .
Elizabeth Bennet	Detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
Elizabeth Bennet	You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Elizabeth Bennet	But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Elizabeth Bennet	For the truth of everything here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ’s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Elizabeth Bennet	If your abhorrence of _ me _ should make _ my _ assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
Elizabeth Bennet	I
Elizabeth Bennet	add , God bless you .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth ’s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was delighted .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .
Elizabeth Bennet	They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned .
Elizabeth Bennet	She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .
Elizabeth Bennet	On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .
Elizabeth Bennet	Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .
Elizabeth Bennet	The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine,--with less of splendour , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . “ And of this place , ” thought she , “ I might have been mistress !
Elizabeth Bennet	With these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted !
Elizabeth Bennet	Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , no , ” recollecting herself , “ that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them .
Elizabeth Bennet	This was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret .
Elizabeth Bennet	She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .
Elizabeth Bennet	At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs. Reynolds replied , that he was ; adding , “ But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !
Elizabeth Bennet	Her aunt now called her to look at a picture .
Elizabeth Bennet	She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantel - piece . Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .
Elizabeth Bennet	The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ’s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expense .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He is now gone into the army , ” she added ; “ but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have heard much of your master ’s fine person , ” said Mrs. Gardiner , looking at the picture ; “ it is a handsome face .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Reynolds ’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth coloured , and said , “ A little . ” “ And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma’am ? ” “ Yes , very handsome . ” “ I am sure _ I _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .
Elizabeth Bennet	This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham ’s being among them .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks : Mrs. Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . “ Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Not so much as I could wish , sir : but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Except , ” thought Elizabeth , “ when she goes to Ramsgate . ” “ If your master would marry , you might see more of him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , sir ; but I do not know when _ that _ will be .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do not know who is good enough for him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth could not help saying , “ It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , “ I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .
Elizabeth Bennet	This was praise of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .
Elizabeth Bennet	That he was not a good - tempered man had been her firmest opinion .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her keenest attention was awakened : she longed to hear more ; and was grateful to her uncle for saying,-- “ There are very few people of whom so much can be said .
Elizabeth Bennet	You are lucky in having such a master . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , sir , I know I am .
Elizabeth Bennet	If I were to go through the world , I could not meet with a better .
Elizabeth Bennet	But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth almost stared at her .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Can this be Mr. Darcy ? ” thought she .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .
Elizabeth Bennet	” “ In what an amiable light does this place him ! ” thought Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ This fine account of him , ” whispered her aunt as they walked , “ is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He is certainly a good brother , ” said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .
Elizabeth Bennet	In the former were many good paintings : but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy ’s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .
Elizabeth Bennet	At last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .
Elizabeth Bennet	She stood several minutes before the picture , in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .
Elizabeth Bennet	There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ’s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .
Elizabeth Bennet	As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ’s happiness were in his guardianship !
Elizabeth Bennet	Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character ; and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before : she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs ; and , taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .
Elizabeth Bennet	As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also ; and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables .
Elizabeth Bennet	He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had instinctively turned away ; but stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .
Elizabeth Bennet	They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family .
Elizabeth Bennet	Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and
Elizabeth Bennet	every idea of the impropriety of her being found there
Elizabeth Bennet	recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .
Elizabeth Bennet	Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .
Elizabeth Bennet	The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was overpowered by shame and vexation .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged thing in the world !
Elizabeth Bennet	It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !
Elizabeth Bennet	why did she come ?
Elizabeth Bennet	She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Elizabeth Bennet	That he should even speak to her
Elizabeth Bennet	was amazing!--but to speak with such civility , to inquire after her family !
Elizabeth Bennet	Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .
Elizabeth Bennet	What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park , when he put his letter into her hand !
Elizabeth Bennet	She knew not what to think , or how to account for it .
Elizabeth Bennet	They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching : but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr. Darcy then was .
Elizabeth Bennet	She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him .
Elizabeth Bennet	Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
Elizabeth Bennet	At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs. Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but
Elizabeth Bennet	Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ’s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .
Elizabeth Bennet	For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Elizabeth Bennet	With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words “ delightful , ” and “ charming , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her colour changed , and she said no more .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Elizabeth Bennet	This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What will be his surprise , ” thought she , “ when he knows who they are !
Elizabeth Bennet	The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
Elizabeth Bennet	She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Elizabeth Bennet	The conversation soon turned upon fishing ; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , “ Why is he so altered ?
Elizabeth Bennet	It can not be for _ me _ , it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened .
Elizabeth Bennet	My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Elizabeth Bennet	It is impossible that he should still love me . ” After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .
Elizabeth Bennet	It originated in Mrs. Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ’s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ’s .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ They will join me early to - morrow , ” he continued , “ and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr . Bingley and his sisters . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley ’s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _ his _ mind was not very differently engaged .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ There is also one other person in the party , ” he continued after a pause , “ who more particularly wishes to be known to you .
Elizabeth Bennet	Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
Elizabeth Bennet	She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .
Elizabeth Bennet	His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind .
Elizabeth Bennet	He then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .
Elizabeth Bennet	She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .
Elizabeth Bennet	At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with great perseverance .
Elizabeth Bennet	Yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _ tête - à - tête _ was over .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage ; and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
Elizabeth Bennet	The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , ” said her uncle . “ There _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , ” replied her aunt ; “ but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .
Elizabeth Bennet	His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ To be sure , Lizzy , ” said her aunt , “ he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ’s countenance , for his features are perfectly good .
Elizabeth Bennet	But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?
Elizabeth Bennet	” Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could : said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , ” replied her uncle .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , to be sure , the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character !
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and , therefore , gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ’s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .
Elizabeth Bennet	In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .
Elizabeth Bennet	The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr. Darcy ’s civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth related to Jane , the next day , what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane listened with astonishment and concern : she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of
Elizabeth Bennet	yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .
Elizabeth Bennet	The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake
Elizabeth Bennet	“ They have both , ” said she , “ been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .
Elizabeth Bennet	My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father ’s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley ’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . ” But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley , if he _ had been _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
Elizabeth Bennet	The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .
Elizabeth Bennet	To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy ’s look and behaviour .
Elizabeth Bennet	The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person ; for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth ’s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley ’s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ’s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke , either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , ” said he , “ that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ; a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Wickham ’s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer , and Mr. Collins ’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .
Elizabeth Bennet	It now first struck her , that _ she _ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .
Elizabeth Bennet	The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _ her _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
Elizabeth Bennet	Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Good heavens ! ” cried Elizabeth ; “ but how could _ that _ be ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose _ him _ . ” Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But what , ” said she , after a pause , “ can have been his motive ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him -- I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	After a few minutes ’ reflection , however , she continued , “ I _ do _ remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , “ To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	She could have added , “ A young man , too , like _ you _ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	But she contented herself with--“And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner .
Elizabeth Bennet	_ My _ father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Philips , appears to do so much credit to ; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ’s active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father ’s death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ as of affection to myself .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How strange ! ” cried Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you .
Elizabeth Bennet	If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . ” “ It _ is _ wonderful , ” replied Wickham ; “ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend .
Elizabeth Bennet	He has also _ brotherly _ pride , which , with _ some _ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I wish I could call her amiable .
Elizabeth Bennet	It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy ; but she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud .
Elizabeth Bennet	As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .
Elizabeth Bennet	But she is nothing to me now .
Elizabeth Bennet	She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . Since her father ’s death her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying,-- “ I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley .
Elizabeth Bennet	How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good - humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?
Elizabeth Bennet	There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ” Mr. Wickham ’s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living .
Elizabeth Bennet	I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , indeed , I did not .
Elizabeth Bennet	I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ’s connections .
Elizabeth Bennet	I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .
Elizabeth Bennet	This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .
Elizabeth Bennet	Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self - destined to another .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Mr. Collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ” “ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied Wickham ; “ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
Elizabeth Bennet	” Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham ’s attentions . There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips ’s supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody . Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .
Elizabeth Bennet	She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham , and of what he had told her ,
Elizabeth Bennet	there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent .
Elizabeth Bennet	Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ’s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ’s side the acquaintance would now be renewed .
Elizabeth Bennet	Georgiana ’s reception of them was very civil , but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . Mrs. Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well - bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her .
Elizabeth Bennet	She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room : she wished , she feared , that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and
Elizabeth Bennet	whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .
Elizabeth Bennet	After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ’s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family .
Elizabeth Bennet	She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
Elizabeth Bennet	While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Elizabeth Bennet	No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ’s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr. Darcy
Elizabeth Bennet	, exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility,-- “ Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ?
Elizabeth Bennet	They must be a great loss to _ your _ family . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	In Darcy ’s presence she dared not mention Wickham ’s name : but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ’s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Elizabeth Bennet	While she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Elizabeth Bennet	Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ’s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Elizabeth Bennet	To no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ’s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth ’s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair ; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully .
Elizabeth Bennet	Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth ’s person , behaviour , and dress .
Elizabeth Bennet	But Georgiana would not join her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her brother ’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour : his judgment could not err ; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
Elizabeth Bennet	When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
Elizabeth Bennet	Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .
Elizabeth Bennet	They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of everything but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ’s beginning the subject .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of ;
Elizabeth Bennet	it was evident that he was very much in love with her .
Elizabeth Bennet	As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _ one _ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .
Elizabeth Bennet	She certainly did not hate him .
Elizabeth Bennet	No ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .
Elizabeth Bennet	, though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .
Elizabeth Bennet	But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good - will which could not be overlooked .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was gratitude;--gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .
Elizabeth Bennet	He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance ; and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .
Elizabeth Bennet	Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and , as such , its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .
Elizabeth Bennet	She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his
Elizabeth Bennet	and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .
Elizabeth Bennet	It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ’s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley -- for she had reached it only to a late breakfast -- ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . They were , therefore , to go .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was pleased ; though when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .
Elizabeth Bennet	To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her Ladyship ’s indignation would have been .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What would she have said ?
Elizabeth Bennet	how would she have behaved ? ” were the questions with which she amused herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , ” said Lady Catherine ; “ I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation , ” replied Elizabeth ; “ but it is not in my power to accept it .
Elizabeth Bennet	I must be in town next Saturday . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .
Elizabeth Bennet	I expected you to stay two months .
Elizabeth Bennet	I told Mrs. Collins so before you came .
Elizabeth Bennet	There can be no occasion for your going so soon .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But my father can not .
Elizabeth Bennet	He wrote last week to hurry my return . ” “ Oh , your father , of course , may spare you , if your mother can .
Elizabeth Bennet	And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . ” “ You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My uncle is to send a servant for us . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Your uncle !
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey ; and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary -- which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .
Elizabeth Bennet	Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours : whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . Mr. Darcy ’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .
Elizabeth Bennet	She studied every sentence ; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .
Elizabeth Bennet	When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation : but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .
Elizabeth Bennet	His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect : but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .
Elizabeth Bennet	In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret : and in the unhappy defects of her family , a subject of yet heavier chagrin .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her father , contented with laughing at them
Elizabeth Bennet	, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ’s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first .
Elizabeth Bennet	The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .
Elizabeth Bennet	The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt .
Elizabeth Bennet	It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ’s disappointment had , in fact , been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct
Elizabeth Bennet	, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before .
Elizabeth Bennet	After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought , reconsidering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself , as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr. Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth could but just _ affect _ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it .
Elizabeth Bennet	She could think only of her letter .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .
Elizabeth Bennet	In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there : his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger ; and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .
Elizabeth Bennet	As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .
Elizabeth Bennet	When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth,-- “ Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more .
Elizabeth Bennet	Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh .
Elizabeth Bennet	When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ’s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ’s courage did not fail her .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation .
Elizabeth Bennet	From the entrance hall , of which Mr. Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth ’s mind
Elizabeth Bennet	, from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .
Elizabeth Bennet	When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small .
Elizabeth Bennet	He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son - in - law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady ’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others .
Elizabeth Bennet	In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew
Elizabeth Bennet	the least , and who , she observed to Mrs. Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .
Elizabeth Bennet	She asked her at different times how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ’s maiden name ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your father ’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think ?
Elizabeth Bennet	For your sake , ” turning to Charlotte , “ I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .
Elizabeth Bennet	Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? ” “ A little . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .
Elizabeth Bennet	Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day .
Elizabeth Bennet	Do your sisters play and sing ? ” “ One of them does . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Do you draw ? ” “ No , not at all . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	But I suppose you had no opportunity .
Elizabeth Bennet	Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My mother would have no objection , but my father hates London . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Has your governess left you ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Then who taught you ?
Elizabeth Bennet	who attended to you ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Without a governess , you must have been neglected .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Ay , no doubt : but that is what a governess will prevent ; and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
Elizabeth Bennet	Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	And you only the second .
Elizabeth Bennet	Your younger sisters must be very young ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .
Elizabeth Bennet	But really , ma’am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Upon my word , ” said her Ladyship , “ you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .
Elizabeth Bennet	Pray , what is your age ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ With three younger sisters grown up , ” replied Elizabeth , smiling , “ your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . ” “ I am not one - and - twenty . ” When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .
Elizabeth Bennet	, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party .
Elizabeth Bennet	Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ’s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologizing if he thought he won too many .
Elizabeth Bennet	When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broken up , the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .
Elizabeth Bennet	As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ’s sake , she made more favourable than it really was .
Elizabeth Bennet	But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ’s praise into his own hands .
Elizabeth Bennet	Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them : anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs. Collins ’s pretty friend had , moreover , caught his fancy very much .
Elizabeth Bennet	He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy .
Elizabeth Bennet	_ His _ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her Ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out,-- “ What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?
Elizabeth Bennet	When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .
Elizabeth Bennet	He drew a chair near her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ’s countenance .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile , and said,-- “ You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me .
Elizabeth Bennet	But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well .
Elizabeth Bennet	There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .
Elizabeth Bennet	My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I shall not say that you are mistaken , ” he replied , “ because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , “ Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .
Elizabeth Bennet	Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am not afraid of you , ” said he , smilingly .
Elizabeth Bennet	Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?
Elizabeth Bennet	My fingers wait your orders . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ” said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I can answer your question , ” said Fitzwilliam , “ without applying to him .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My fingers , ” said Elizabeth , “ do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women ’s do .
Elizabeth Bennet	But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising .
Elizabeth Bennet	It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman ’s of superior execution . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Darcy smiled and said , “ You are perfectly right .
Elizabeth Bennet	You have employed your time much better .
Elizabeth Bennet	No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth immediately began playing again .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth looked at Darcy , to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ’s praise : but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and
Elizabeth Bennet	she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _ her _ , had she been his relation .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ’s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ’s carriage was ready to take them all home .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He must be an oddity , I think , ” said she .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I can not make him out .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Are they , indeed ? ” cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !
Elizabeth Bennet	It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , ” thought Elizabeth ; “ _ that _ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And Mary King is safe ! ” added Elizabeth ; “ safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , ” said Jane .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am sure there is not on _ his _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _ expression _ herself , the coarseness of the _ sentiment _ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !
Elizabeth Bennet	but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham ’s name .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,---- “ I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton , and see how everybody went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .
Elizabeth Bennet	There was another reason , too , for her opposition .
Elizabeth Bennet	She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .
Elizabeth Bennet	The comfort to _ her _ , of the regiment ’s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .
Elizabeth Bennet	In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , ” said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; “ and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Do you really think so ? ” cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Upon my word , ” said Mrs. Gardiner , “ I begin to be of your uncle ’s opinion .
Elizabeth Bennet	Can you , yourself , Lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ” “ Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .
Elizabeth Bennet	But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .
Elizabeth Bennet	But I dare not hope it .
Elizabeth Bennet	His most particular friend , you see by Jane ’s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .
Elizabeth Bennet	But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ’s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? ” “ It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , ” replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , “ that a sister ’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , really , I know not what to say .
Elizabeth Bennet	Perhaps I am not doing her justice .
Elizabeth Bennet	She has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough .
Elizabeth Bennet	” “ But you see that Jane , ” said her aunt , “ does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .
Elizabeth Bennet	We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And do you really know all this ? ” cried Mrs. Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do , indeed , ” replied Elizabeth , colouring .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .
Elizabeth Bennet	And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .
Elizabeth Bennet	From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .
Elizabeth Bennet	can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself .
Elizabeth Bennet	And when I returned home the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ’s time .
Elizabeth Bennet	As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?
Elizabeth Bennet	And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .
Elizabeth Bennet	That such a consequence as _ this _ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? ” “ Not the slightest .
Elizabeth Bennet	I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away .
Elizabeth Bennet	From Elizabeth ’s thoughts it was never absent .
Elizabeth Bennet	Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self - reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .
Elizabeth Bennet	The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . Elizabeth jumped out ; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running downstairs from her mother ’s apartment ,
Elizabeth Bennet	immediately met her
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Is my father in town ? ” “ Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do .
Elizabeth Bennet	He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . ” “ And my mother -- how is she ?
Elizabeth Bennet	How are you all ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But you -- how are you ? ” cried Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children ,
Elizabeth Bennet	When they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give .
Elizabeth Bennet	The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce the marriage .
Elizabeth Bennet	And now here ’s Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?
Elizabeth Bennet	The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . “ Do not give way to useless alarm , ” added he : “ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .
Elizabeth Bennet	As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . ” “ Oh , my dear brother , ” replied Mrs. Bennet , “ that is exactly what I could most wish for .
Elizabeth Bennet	And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry .
Elizabeth Bennet	Tell him what a dreadful state I am in -- that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .
Elizabeth Bennet	And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .
Elizabeth Bennet	I know you will contrive it all . ” But Mr. Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters .
Elizabeth Bennet	Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it ; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _ one _ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .
Elizabeth Bennet	The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty .
Elizabeth Bennet	As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table,-- “ This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of .
Elizabeth Bennet	But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . ” Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , “ Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . ” Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .
Elizabeth Bennet	In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .
Elizabeth Bennet	After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject by saying , “ But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am so grieved for him .
Elizabeth Bennet	He _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . ” “ And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?
Elizabeth Bennet	He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying , and from _ that _ I am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before
Elizabeth Bennet	I felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister ’s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .
Elizabeth Bennet	My father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .
Elizabeth Bennet	Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ’s last letter she had prepared her for such a step .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , I believe not . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .
Elizabeth Bennet	He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt : but I hope this may be false . ” “ Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! ” “ Perhaps it would have been better , ” replied her sister .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ We acted with the best intentions . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He brought it with him for us to see . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	/ * NIND “ My dear Harriet , * / “ You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I can not help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am missed .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am going to Gretna Green , and if you can not guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel .
Elizabeth Bennet	You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up .
Elizabeth Bennet	I hope you will drink to our good journey .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your affectionate friend , “ LYDIA BENNET . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! ” cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .
Elizabeth Bennet	But at least it shows that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy .
Elizabeth Bennet	My poor father !
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I never saw anyone so shocked .
Elizabeth Bennet	My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , Jane , ” cried Elizabeth , “ was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? ” “ I do not know : I hope there was .
Elizabeth Bennet	My mother was in hysterics ; and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done .
Elizabeth Bennet	But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your attendance upon her has been too much for you .
Elizabeth Bennet	You do not look well .
Elizabeth Bennet	Oh that I had been with you !
Elizabeth Bennet	you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . ” “ Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .
Elizabeth Bennet	My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was of great use and comfort to us all , and Lady Lucas has been very kind : she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . ” “ She had better have stayed at home , ” cried Elizabeth : “ perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one ’s neighbours .
Elizabeth Bennet	Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He meant , I believe , ” replied Jane , “ to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if anything could be made out from them .
Elizabeth Bennet	The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy .
Elizabeth Bennet	but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of Bingley , and _ her _ being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
Elizabeth Bennet	And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached Lady Catherine , ) had only set _ that _ down as almost certain and immediate which _ she _ had looked forward to as possible at some future time .
Elizabeth Bennet	In revolving Lady Catherine ’s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
Elizabeth Bennet	From what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce .
Elizabeth Bennet	She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _ she _ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one _ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Elizabeth Bennet	With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , ” she added , “ I shall know how to understand it .
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
Elizabeth Bennet	If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . ” The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great : but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet ’s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject . The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lizzy , ” said he , “ I was going to look for you : come into my room . ” She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
Elizabeth Bennet	It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine , and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
Elizabeth Bennet	She followed her father to the fireplace , and they both sat down .
Elizabeth Bennet	As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .
Elizabeth Bennet	Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest .
Elizabeth Bennet	The colour now rushed into Elizabeth ’s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself , when her father continued,-- “ You look conscious .
Elizabeth Bennet	Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even _ your _ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer .
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point .
Elizabeth Bennet	What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another , of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
Elizabeth Bennet	Your daughter Elizabeth
Elizabeth Bennet	, it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it ; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ’
Elizabeth Bennet	Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ’s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ’
Elizabeth Bennet	Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
Elizabeth Bennet	‘ My motive for cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ’
Elizabeth Bennet	_ Mr. Darcy _ , you see , is the man !
Elizabeth Bennet	Now , Lizzy , I think I _ have _ surprised you .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _ you _ in his life !
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth tried to join in her father ’s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .
Elizabeth Bennet	Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . “ Are you not diverted ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ ‘ After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
Elizabeth Bennet	I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ’
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Collins , moreover , adds , ‘ I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ’s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known .
Elizabeth Bennet	I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
Elizabeth Bennet	You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow
Elizabeth Bennet	their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ’
Elizabeth Bennet	But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
Elizabeth Bennet	You are not going to be _ missish _ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , ” cried Elizabeth , “ I am exceedingly diverted .
Elizabeth Bennet	Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference and _ your _ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd !
Elizabeth Bennet	And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Did she call to refuse her consent ? ” To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of Mr. Darcy ’s indifference ; and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that , perhaps , instead of his seeing too _ little _ , she might have fancied too _ much _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied,-- “ The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers .
Elizabeth Bennet	While in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends -- to his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? ” “ Yes ; and I had heard it before .
Elizabeth Bennet	But what is that to me ?
Elizabeth Bennet	If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh .
Elizabeth Bennet	And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .
Elizabeth Bennet	You will
Elizabeth Bennet	Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ These are heavy misfortunes , ” replied Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Obstinate , headstrong girl !
Elizabeth Bennet	I am ashamed of you !
Elizabeth Bennet	Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Is nothing due to me on that score ?
Elizabeth Bennet	You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it .
Elizabeth Bennet	I have not been used to submit to any person ’s whims .
Elizabeth Bennet	I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment .
Elizabeth Bennet	” “ _ That _ will make your Ladyship ’s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _ me _ . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I will not be interrupted !
Elizabeth Bennet	Hear me in silence .
Elizabeth Bennet	My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .
Elizabeth Bennet	If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .
Elizabeth Bennet	He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ’s daughter ; so far we are equal . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	You _ are _ a gentleman ’s daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	But what was your mother ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Who are your uncles and aunts ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Whatever my connections may be , ” said Elizabeth , “ if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? ” Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment ’s deliberation,-- “ I am not . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine seemed pleased .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement ? ” “ I will make no promise of the kind . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Miss Bennet , I am shocked and astonished .
Elizabeth Bennet	I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .
Elizabeth Bennet	But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede .
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . ” “ And I certainly _ never _ shall give it .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .
Elizabeth Bennet	Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged .
Elizabeth Bennet	You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .
Elizabeth Bennet	How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .
Elizabeth Bennet	I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no further on the subject . ” “ Not so hasty , if you please . I have by no means done .
Elizabeth Bennet	To all the objections I have already urged I have still another to add .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ’s infamous elopement .
Elizabeth Bennet	I know it all ; that the young man ’s marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expense of your father and uncle .
Elizabeth Bennet	And is _ such _ a girl to be my nephew ’s sister ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You can _ now _ have nothing further to say , ” she resentfully answered .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You have insulted me , in every possible method .
Elizabeth Bennet	I must beg to return to the house . ” And she rose as she spoke .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her Ladyship was highly incensed .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !
Elizabeth Bennet	Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lady Catherine , I have nothing further to say .
Elizabeth Bennet	You know my sentiments . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are then resolved to have him ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have said no such thing .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _ you _ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	You refuse , then , to oblige me .
Elizabeth Bennet	You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .
Elizabeth Bennet	You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , ” replied Elizabeth , “ has any possible claim on me , in the present instance .
Elizabeth Bennet	No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy .
Elizabeth Bennet	And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ’s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And this is your real opinion !
Elizabeth Bennet	This is your final resolve !
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall now know how to act .
Elizabeth Bennet	Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .
Elizabeth Bennet	I came to try you .
Elizabeth Bennet	I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added,-- “ I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .
Elizabeth Bennet	I send no compliments to your mother .
Elizabeth Bennet	You deserve no such attention .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am most seriously displeased . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her Ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressing - room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ She did not choose it , ” said her daughter ; “ she would go . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ She is a very fine - looking woman !
Elizabeth Bennet	and her calling here was prodigiously civil !
Elizabeth Bennet	for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .
Elizabeth Bennet	She is on her road somewhere , I dare say ; and so , passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
Elizabeth Bennet	and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till , catching her eye , he withdrew his own , and coldly said , “ She is tolerable : but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .
Elizabeth Bennet	You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth
Elizabeth Bennet	She told the story , however , with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in anything ridiculous .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth felt Jane ’s pleasure .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , Lizzy !
Elizabeth Bennet	it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins ’s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .
Elizabeth Bennet	He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ’s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and , in compassion to her nieces , turned the conversation .
Elizabeth Bennet	When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .
Elizabeth Bennet	] “ An excellent consolation in its way , ” said Elizabeth ; “ but it will not do for _ us _ .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But that expression of ‘ violently in love ’ is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .
Elizabeth Bennet	At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance ; and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer .
Elizabeth Bennet	Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? ” “ Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .
Elizabeth Bennet	It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .
Elizabeth Bennet	Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . ” Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ’s ready acquiescence .
Elizabeth Bennet	My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?
Elizabeth Bennet	I hope they will not meet at all .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ She will drop the acquaintance entirely . ” But , in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ’s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
Elizabeth Bennet	It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane ’s attractions .
Elizabeth Bennet	on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth ’s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .
Elizabeth Bennet	Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
Elizabeth Bennet	[ Illustration : “ Will you come and see me ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ So , Lizzy , ” said he , one day , “ your sister is crossed in love , I find .
Elizabeth Bennet	The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr. Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy
Elizabeth Bennet	Two days after Mr. Bennet ’s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , “ I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out,-- “ Oh , papa , what news ? what news ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What is there of good to be expected ? ” said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; “ but perhaps you would like to read it .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .
Elizabeth Bennet	It is enough to know they are discovered : I have seen them both---- ” “ Then it is as I always hoped , ” cried Jane : “ they are married ! ” Elizabeth read on : “ I have seen them both .
Elizabeth Bennet	nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .
Elizabeth Bennet	All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .
Elizabeth Bennet	These are conditions which , considering everything , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .
Elizabeth Bennet	You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham ’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .
Elizabeth Bennet	The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .
Elizabeth Bennet	If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .
Elizabeth Bennet	There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .
Elizabeth Bennet	Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .
Elizabeth Bennet	We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Is it possible ? ” cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , ” said her sister .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dear father , I congratulate you . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And have you answered the letter ? ” said Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No ; but it must be done soon . ” Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . “ Oh !
Elizabeth Bennet	my dear father , ” she cried , “ come back and write immediately .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And -- may I ask ? ” said Elizabeth ; “ but the terms , I suppose , must be
Elizabeth Bennet	I am only ashamed of his asking so little . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	my uncle ! ” cried Jane , “ what do you mean , sir ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That is very true , ” said Elizabeth ; “ though it had not occurred to me before .
Elizabeth Bennet	Oh , it must be my uncle ’s doings !
Elizabeth Bennet	Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , ” said her father .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And they are really to be married ! ” cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ” replied Jane , “ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ” said Elizabeth , “ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .
Elizabeth Bennet	The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
Elizabeth Bennet	What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Their conduct has been such , ” replied Elizabeth , “ as neither you , nor I , nor anybody , can ever forget .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ May we take my uncle ’s letter to read to her ? ” “ Take whatever you like , and get away . ” Elizabeth took the letter from his writing - table , and they went upstairs together .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .
Elizabeth Bennet	Poor Lydia ’s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .
Elizabeth Bennet	She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness , nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .
Elizabeth Bennet	Their sister ’s wedding - day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .
Elizabeth Bennet	Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself ; but his manners were always so pleasing , that , had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .
Elizabeth Bennet	_ She _ blushed , and Jane blushed ; but
Elizabeth Bennet	The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood ,
Elizabeth Bennet	Her father lifted up his eyes , Jane was distressed , Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued,-- “ Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ?
Elizabeth Bennet	I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like anything .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth could bear it no longer .
Elizabeth Bennet	She got up and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour .
Elizabeth Bennet	She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ’s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister,-- “ Ah , Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I thank you for my share of the favour , ” said Elizabeth ; “ but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Wickham ’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ’s for him .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .
Elizabeth Bennet	One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth,-- “ Lizzy , I never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , I believe .
Elizabeth Bennet	You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it .
Elizabeth Bennet	Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , really , ” replied Elizabeth ; “ I think there can not be too little said on the subject . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	You are so strange !
Elizabeth Bennet	But I must tell you how it went off .
Elizabeth Bennet	We were married , you know , at St. Clement ’s , because Wickham ’s lodgings were in that parish .
Elizabeth Bennet	My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . “ Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss !
Elizabeth Bennet	I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted .
Elizabeth Bennet	And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .
Elizabeth Bennet	However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .
Elizabeth Bennet	I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual : I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .
Elizabeth Bennet	If you ’ll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone .
Elizabeth Bennet	Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day .
Elizabeth Bennet	However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Mr. Darcy ! ” repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .
Elizabeth Bennet	he was to come there with Wickham , you know .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , gracious me !
Elizabeth Bennet	I quite forgot !
Elizabeth Bennet	I ought not to have said a word about it .
Elizabeth Bennet	I promised them so faithfully !
Elizabeth Bennet	You may depend upon my seeking no further . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , certainly , ” said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; “ we will ask you no questions . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Thank you , ” said Lydia ; “ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ” On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy had been at her sister ’s wedding .
Elizabeth Bennet	Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
Elizabeth Bennet	Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
Elizabeth Bennet	She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropped , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You may readily comprehend , ” she added , “ what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Not that I _ shall _ , though , ” she added to herself , and she finished the letter ; “ and , my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane ’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
Elizabeth Bennet	March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .
Elizabeth Bennet	Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins .
Elizabeth Bennet	The journey would , moreover , give her a peep at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .
Elizabeth Bennet	The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .
Elizabeth Bennet	The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .
Elizabeth Bennet	His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . Her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ’s too long .
Elizabeth Bennet	He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out , like his information .
Elizabeth Bennet	As they drove to Mr. Gardiner ’s door , Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival : when they entered the passage , she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .
Elizabeth Bennet	Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute inquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ’s visit in Gracechurch Street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ’s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But , my dear Elizabeth , ” she added , “ what sort of girl is Miss King ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ” “ If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . ” “ She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .
Elizabeth Bennet	If it were not allowable for him to gain _ my _ affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , ” cried Elizabeth , “ have it as you choose .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , Lizzy , that is what I do _ not _ choose .
Elizabeth Bennet	I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him .
Elizabeth Bennet	Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . ” “ Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment .
Elizabeth Bennet	Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .
Elizabeth Bennet	No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dear , dear aunt , ” she rapturously cried , “ what delight ! what felicity !
Elizabeth Bennet	You give me fresh life and vigour .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth shook her head over this letter .
Elizabeth Bennet	It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister ’s being in town .
Elizabeth Bennet	The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- “ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .
Elizabeth Bennet	I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .
Elizabeth Bennet	Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime .
Elizabeth Bennet	did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was , in every respect , so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .
Elizabeth Bennet	I pity , though I can not help blaming , her .
Elizabeth Bennet	She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .
Elizabeth Bennet	But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .
Elizabeth Bennet	I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable .
Elizabeth Bennet	I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .
Elizabeth Bennet	He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .
Elizabeth Bennet	I can not understand it .
Elizabeth Bennet	If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .
Elizabeth Bennet	I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am sure you will be very comfortable there . “ Yours , etc . ” This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned , as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .
Elizabeth Bennet	She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .
Elizabeth Bennet	His character sunk on every review of it ; and , as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry
Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy ’s sister , as , by Wickham ’s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away
Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _ she _ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .
Elizabeth Bennet	The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte ’s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and , while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .
Elizabeth Bennet	All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner ; and , after relating the circumstances , she thus went on:--“I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .
Elizabeth Bennet	But my feelings are not only cordial towards _ him _ , they are even impartial towards Miss King .
Elizabeth Bennet	I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .
Elizabeth Bennet	My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .
Elizabeth Bennet	I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Lizzy is not a bit better than the others : and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good - humoured as Lydia .
Elizabeth Bennet	But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ They have none of them much to recommend them , ” replied he : “ they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . ” “ Mr. Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?
Elizabeth Bennet	” was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge .
Elizabeth Bennet	She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .
Elizabeth Bennet	Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .
Elizabeth Bennet	She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known : she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _ dislike _ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .
Elizabeth Bennet	At night she opened her heart to Jane .
Elizabeth Bennet	Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ’s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are joking , Lizzy .
Elizabeth Bennet	No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .
Elizabeth Bennet	Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .
Elizabeth Bennet	I speak nothing but the truth .
Elizabeth Bennet	He still loves me , and we are engaged . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Jane looked at her doubtingly .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , Lizzy !
Elizabeth Bennet	I know how much you dislike him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable .
Elizabeth Bennet	This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth again , and more
Elizabeth Bennet	seriously , assured her of its truth .
Elizabeth Bennet	Yet now I must believe you , ” cried Jane .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .
Elizabeth Bennet	And do you really love him quite well enough ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Oh , Lizzy !
Elizabeth Bennet	Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?
Elizabeth Bennet	You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do when I tell you all . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What do you mean ? ” “ Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley .
Elizabeth Bennet	I am afraid you will be angry . ” “ My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious .
Elizabeth Bennet	I want to talk very seriously .
Elizabeth Bennet	Let me know everything that I am to know without delay .
Elizabeth Bennet	Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began ; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
Elizabeth Bennet	When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Now I am quite happy , ” said she , “ for you will be as happy as myself .
Elizabeth Bennet	I always had a value for him .
Elizabeth Bennet	Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ’s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
Elizabeth Bennet	How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !
Elizabeth Bennet	I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
Elizabeth Bennet	She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend : but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia ’s marriage .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ’s way . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , “ Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .
Elizabeth Bennet	Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .
Elizabeth Bennet	As she went upstairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying,-- “ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it .
Elizabeth Bennet	It is all for Jane ’s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ” During their walk , it was resolved that Mr. Bennet ’s consent should be asked in the course of the evening : Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ’s .
Elizabeth Bennet	She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man ; but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
Elizabeth Bennet	In the evening , soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
Elizabeth Bennet	She did not fear her father ’s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means ; that _ she _ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
Elizabeth Bennet	In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , “ Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	She was gone directly .
Elizabeth Bennet	Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lizzy , ” said he , “ what are you doing ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Are you out of your senses to be accepting this man ?
Elizabeth Bennet	Have not you always hated him ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
Elizabeth Bennet	It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr. Darcy
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Or , in other words , you are determined to have him .
Elizabeth Bennet	He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .
Elizabeth Bennet	But will they make you happy ? ” “ Have you any other objection , ” said Elizabeth , “ than your belief of my indifference ? ” “ None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ” “ I do , I do like him , ” she replied , with tears in her eyes ; “ I love him .
Elizabeth Bennet	You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lizzy , ” said her father , “ I have given him my consent .
Elizabeth Bennet	I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him .
Elizabeth Bennet	But let me advise you to think better of it .
Elizabeth Bennet	I know your disposition , Lizzy .
Elizabeth Bennet	I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior .
Elizabeth Bennet	Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
Elizabeth Bennet	You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .
Elizabeth Bennet	My child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life .
Elizabeth Bennet	You know not what you are about . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and , at length , by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ’ suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ’s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , my dear , ” said he , when she ceased speaking , “ I have no more to say .
Elizabeth Bennet	If this be the case , he deserves you .
Elizabeth Bennet	I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .
Elizabeth Bennet	He heard her with astonishment .
Elizabeth Bennet	Had it been your uncle ’s doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way .
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading Mr. Collins ’s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go , saying , as she quitted the room , “ If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	Elizabeth ’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ’s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .
Elizabeth Bennet	When her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
Elizabeth Bennet	Its effect was most extraordinary ; for , on first hearing it , Mrs. Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .
Elizabeth Bennet	Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard , though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .
Elizabeth Bennet	Lord bless me !
Elizabeth Bennet	dear me !
Elizabeth Bennet	Oh , my sweetest Lizzy !
Elizabeth Bennet	how rich and how great you will be !
Elizabeth Bennet	you will have !
Elizabeth Bennet	I am so pleased -- so happy .
Elizabeth Bennet	Oh , my dear Lizzy !
Elizabeth Bennet	pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before .
Elizabeth Bennet	I hope he will overlook it .
Elizabeth Bennet	what will become of me ?
Elizabeth Bennet	I shall go distracted .
Elizabeth Bennet	This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted ; and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .
Elizabeth Bennet	But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dearest child , ” she cried , “ I can think of nothing else .
Elizabeth Bennet	And a special licence -- you must and shall be married by a special licence .
Elizabeth Bennet	But , my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . ” This was a sad omen of what her mother ’s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ’ consent , there was still something to be wished for .
Elizabeth Bennet	But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane ’s . ”
Jane Bennet	Jane recollected herself soon ; and putting the letter away , tried
Jane Bennet	to join , with her usual cheerfulness , in the general conversation : but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave ,
Jane Bennet	than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs .
Jane Bennet	When they had gained their own room , Jane , taking out her letter , said , “ This is from Caroline Bingley : what it contains has surprised me a good deal .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament : it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley ’s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his . “ It is unlucky , ” said she , after a short pause , “ that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
Jane Bennet	“ It is evident by this , ” added Jane , “ that he comes back no more this winter . ” “ It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . ” “ Why will you think so ?
Jane Bennet	But you do not know _ all _ .
Jane Bennet	I _ will _ read you the passage which particularly hurts me .
Jane Bennet	What think you of _ this _ sentence , my dear Lizzy ? ” said Jane , as she finished it .
Jane Bennet	Will you hear it ? ” “ Most willingly . ”
Jane Bennet	“ You shall have it in a few words .
Jane Bennet	Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .
Jane Bennet	She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . ”
Jane Bennet	Jane shook her head .
Jane Bennet	“ Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me .
Jane Bennet	No one who has ever seen you together
Jane Bennet	But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ”
Jane Bennet	“ If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , ” replied Jane , “ your representation of all this might make me quite easy .
Jane Bennet	But I know the foundation is unjust .
Jane Bennet	Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . ” “ That is right .
Jane Bennet	You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine : believe her to be deceived , by all means .
Jane Bennet	“ But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ” “ You must decide for yourself , ” said Elizabeth ; “ and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you , by all means , to refuse him . ” “ How can you talk so ? ” said Jane , faintly smiling ; “ you must know , that , though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . ” “ I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . ” “ But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .
Jane Bennet	She represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . Jane ’s temper was not desponding ; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart .
Jane Bennet	Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . “ I am astonished , my dear , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .
Jane Bennet	Mrs. Bennet ’s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read,-- “ Well , Jane , who is it from ?
Jane Bennet	Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . ”
Jane Bennet	“ It is from Miss Bingley , ” said Jane , and then read it aloud .
Jane Bennet	“ My dear friend , * /
Jane Bennet	Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .
Jane Bennet	“ With the officers ! ” cried Lydia : “ I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . ” “ Dining out , ” said Mrs. Bennet ; “ that is very unlucky . ” “ Can I have the carriage ? ” said Jane .
Jane Bennet	“ No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I had much rather go in the coach . ”
Jane Bennet	“ But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure .
Jane Bennet	She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged ; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .
Jane Bennet	Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .
Jane Bennet	The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back .
Jane Bennet	“ I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , ” said her father , “ to send for the horses ? ” “ No , indeed .
Jane Bennet	I do not wish to avoid the walk .
Jane Bennet	I shall be back by dinner . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I admire the activity of your benevolence , ” observed Mary , “ but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . ”
Jane Bennet	“ We will go as far as Meryton with you , ” said Catherine and Lydia .
Jane Bennet	She was shown into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .
Jane Bennet	Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit ,
Jane Bennet	She was not equal , however , to much conversation ; and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .
Jane Bennet	When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane .
Jane Bennet	wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .
Jane Bennet	The day of his and Lydia ’s departure soon came ; and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .
Jane Bennet	“ Oh , my dear Lydia , ” she cried , “ when shall we meet again ? ”
Jane Bennet	The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days . “ I often think , ” said she , “ that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ’s friends .
Jane Bennet	Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ’s regiment happens to be so far off .
Jane Bennet	If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .
Jane Bennet	She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head , by turns .
Jane Bennet	“ Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , ” ( for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news ) .
Jane Bennet	You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .
Jane Bennet	“ You may depend on it , ” replied the other , “ for Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton last night : I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certainly true .
Jane Bennet	Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _ with _ his friend ’s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .
Jane Bennet	In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .
Jane Bennet	“ As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ you will wait on him , of course . ”
Jane Bennet	As the day of his arrival drew near,-- “ I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , ” said Jane to her sister .
Jane Bennet	“ I wish I could say anything to comfort you , ” replied Elizabeth ; “ but it is wholly out of my power .
Jane Bennet	You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . ”
Jane Bennet	Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked -- she saw Mr. Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . “ There is a gentleman with him , mamma , ” said Kitty ; “ who can it be ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . ”
Jane Bennet	Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .
Jane Bennet	She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .
Jane Bennet	But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner ’s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .
Jane Bennet	To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merits she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .
Jane Bennet	She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door .
Jane Bennet	Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected .
Jane Bennet	But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .
Jane Bennet	She inquired after his sister , but could do no more . “ It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , ” said Mrs. Bennet .
Jane Bennet	It was only said , ‘ Lately , George Wickham , Esq . , to Miss Lydia Bennet , ’ without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything .
Jane Bennet	Did you see it ? ”
Jane Bennet	At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion . “ The first wish of my heart , ” said she to herself , “ is never more to be in company with either of them .
Jane Bennet	Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover .
Jane Bennet	When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good - natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever ; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days ’ time .
Jane Bennet	With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley , and talked of Mrs. Darcy , may be guessed .
Jane Bennet	Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .
Jane Bennet	So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart .
Jane Bennet	was then gratified : he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire ; and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
Jane Bennet	She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia ; and , removed from the influence of Lydia ’s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .
Jane Bennet	From the further disadvantage of Lydia ’s society
Jane Bennet	As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
Jane Bennet	The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .
Jane Bennet	It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .
Jane Bennet	Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long , that even Bingley ’s good - humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _ talk _ of giving them a hint to be gone .
Jane Bennet	I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh .
Jane Bennet	She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .
Jane Bennet	Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .
Jane Bennet	The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother ’s in sending it .
Jane Bennet	Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .
Jane Bennet	In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters ’ room , in her dressing - gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out,-- “ My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down .
Jane Bennet	“ We will be down as soon as we can , ” said Jane ; “ but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago .
Jane Bennet	where is your sash , my dear ? ”
Jane Bennet	But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .
Jane Bennet	Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that _ she _ would not give in to it .
Jane Bennet	Bingley was everything that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .
Jane Bennet	He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet ’s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .
Jane Bennet	Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet ’s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter .
Jane Bennet	Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and , instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .
Jane Bennet	was a fresh source of happiness to Jane .
Jane Bennet	Oh , Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . “ And this , ” said she , “ is the end of all his friend ’s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ’s falsehood and contrivance !
Jane Bennet	They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of Jane ’s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .
Jane Bennet	Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said,-- “ Jane , I congratulate you .
Jane Bennet	You will be a very happy woman . ”
Jane Bennet	Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .
Jane Bennet	“ You are a good girl , ” he replied , “ and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .
Jane Bennet	Then addressing her daughter , “ Oh , my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !
Jane Bennet	I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !
Jane Bennet	I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .
Jane Bennet	Jane was beyond competition her favourite child .
Jane Bennet	Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else : but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .
Jane Bennet	In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .
Jane Bennet	“ He has made me so happy , ” said she , one evening , “ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !
Jane Bennet	I had not believed it possible . ”
Jane Bennet	It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley ’s pretended regard . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ” “ He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . ”
Jane Bennet	This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
Jane Bennet	“ I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! ” cried Jane .
Jane Bennet	“ Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy !
Jane Bennet	“ If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you .
Jane Bennet	Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .
Jane Bennet	No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time .
Jane Bennet	“ Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . ” “ Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice .
Jane Bennet	To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her
Jane Bennet	“ _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Eliza , ” said Charlotte .
Jane Bennet	Poor Eliza !
Jane Bennet	_ ] ] “ Are you quite sure , ma’am ? Is not there a little mistake ? ” said Jane .
Jane Bennet	“ I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Miss Bingley told me , ” said Jane , “ that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .
Jane Bennet	“ I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , ” said Miss Lucas , “ but I wish he had danced with Eliza . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Another time , Lizzy , ” said her mother , “ I would not dance with _ him _ , if I were you . ”
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .
Jane Bennet	Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match : but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Jane Bennet	Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
Jane Bennet	Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
Jane Bennet	Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane ’s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .
Jane Bennet	The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters , and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
Jane Bennet	As for Jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ’s : but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing ; and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .
Jane Bennet	But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill - used .
Jane Bennet	It needed all Jane ’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
Jane Bennet	“ You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course .
Jane Bennet	My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .
Jane Bennet	Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth instantly read her feelings ; and , at that moment , solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and everything else , gave way before the hope of Jane ’s being in the fairest way for happiness . “ I want to know , ” said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ’s , “ what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham .
Jane Bennet	But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person , in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ”
Jane Bennet	“ No , ” replied Jane , “ I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Jane Bennet	Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Jane Bennet	“ I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley ’s sincerity , ” said Elizabeth warmly , “ but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ’s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
Jane Bennet	My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ” “ You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ? ” “ Indeed I am .
Jane Bennet	” As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .
Jane Bennet	When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley .
Jane Bennet	His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Jane Bennet	It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and , lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
Jane Bennet	She looked at Jane to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .
Jane Bennet	Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
Jane Bennet	Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
Jane Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months .
Jane Bennet	“ How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? ”
Jane Bennet	Wholly inattentive to her sister ’s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone ’s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . “ I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , ” said she , “ though I am _ not _ her particular friend .
Jane Bennet	In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .
Jane Bennet	“ What ! has she frightened away some of your lovers ?
Jane Bennet	Poor little Lizzy !
Jane Bennet	Oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?
Jane Bennet	” Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and , affectionately taking her hand , said , in reply,-- “ Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .
Jane Bennet	Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say , three -- very silly sisters .
Jane Bennet	Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?
Jane Bennet	With an air of indifference , he soon afterwards added , “ How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? ” “ Nearly three weeks . ” “ And you saw him frequently ? ” “ Yes , almost every day . ” “ His manners are very different from his cousin ’s . ”
Jane Bennet	I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .
Jane Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and , in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .
Jane Bennet	She was engaged one day , as she walked , in re - perusing Jane ’s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy , she saw , on looking up , that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Jane Bennet	That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Jane Bennet	If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _ he _ was the cause -- his pride and caprice were the cause -- of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .
Jane Bennet	“ To Jane herself , ” she exclaimed , “ there could be no possibility of objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is !
Jane Bennet	Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
Jane Bennet	They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley ’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .
Jane Bennet	Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .
Jane Bennet	In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .
Jane Bennet	Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .
Jane Bennet	After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ’s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .
Jane Bennet	Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ’s beauty .
Jane Bennet	I do not like to boast of my own child ; but to be sure , Jane -- one does not often see anybody better looking .
Jane Bennet	When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ’s in town so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .
Jane Bennet	Perhaps he thought her too young .
Jane Bennet	However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were .
Jane Bennet	She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .
Jane Bennet	“ Oh yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well ; and by that time , most likely , Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .
Jane Bennet	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _ her _ , in spite of all Miss Bingley ’s witticisms on _ fine eyes _ .
Jane Bennet	The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham .
Jane Bennet	I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country .
Jane Bennet	, I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ’s accidental information , that Bingley ’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .
Jane Bennet	From that moment I observed my friend ’s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .
Jane Bennet	Your sister I also watched .
Jane Bennet	Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard ; and I remained convinced , from the evening ’s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
Jane Bennet	Your superior knowledge of your sister
Jane Bennet	If it be so , if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
Jane Bennet	But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
Jane Bennet	That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
Jane Bennet	I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason .
Jane Bennet	The situation of your mother ’s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend you . But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
Jane Bennet	But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance , which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ’s indifference .
Jane Bennet	He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal , regard .
Jane Bennet	There is but one part of my conduct , in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ’s being in town .
Jane Bennet	I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Jane Bennet	That they might have met without ill consequence is , perhaps , probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
Jane Bennet	If I have wounded your sister ’s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient
Jane Bennet	My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ’s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .
Jane Bennet	About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr. Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained
Jane Bennet	Regard for my sister ’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge .
Jane Bennet	Mr. Wickham ’s chief object was unquestionably my sister ’s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth related to Jane , the next day , what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself .
Jane Bennet	Jane listened with astonishment and concern : she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of
Jane Bennet	“ Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?
Jane Bennet	“ I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . ” But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley , if he _ had been _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
Jane Bennet	Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy ’s look and behaviour .
Jane Bennet	To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ’s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?
Jane Bennet	Anxiety on Jane ’s behalf was another prevailing concern ; and Mr. Darcy ’s explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .
Jane Bennet	His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .
Jane Bennet	How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !
Jane Bennet	It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ’s disappointment had , in fact , been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct
Jane Bennet	Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .
Jane Bennet	expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones ’s shopboy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield , because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane ’s introduction of him .
Jane Bennet	As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .
Jane Bennet	Why , Jane -- you never dropped a word of this -- you sly thing !
Jane Bennet	Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .
Jane Bennet	“ Though it is difficult , ” said Jane , “ to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . ”
Jane Bennet	Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .
Jane Bennet	“ But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , ” said Jane .
Jane Bennet	Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .
Jane Bennet	She is almost three - and - twenty !
Jane Bennet	Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,---- “ I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . ”
Jane Bennet	His most particular friend , you see by Jane ’s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .
Jane Bennet	” “ But you see that Jane , ” said her aunt , “ does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Of whom does Jane ever think ill ?
Jane Bennet	And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?
Jane Bennet	But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .
Jane Bennet	can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? ”
Jane Bennet	As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?
Jane Bennet	It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .
Jane Bennet	“ Not yet , ” replied Jane .
Jane Bennet	“ But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Is my father in town ? ” “ Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . ”
Jane Bennet	“ And have you heard from him often ? ” “ We have heard only once .
Jane Bennet	“ But you -- how are you ? ” cried Elizabeth .
Jane Bennet	“ You look pale .
Jane Bennet	How much you must have gone through ! ”
Jane Bennet	Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .
Jane Bennet	When they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give .
Jane Bennet	The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce the marriage .
Jane Bennet	In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .
Jane Bennet	He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt : but I hope this may be false . ” “ Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! ” “ Perhaps it would have been better , ” replied her sister .
Jane Bennet	Jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to Elizabeth .
Jane Bennet	“ Oh , Jane , ” cried Elizabeth , “ was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? ” “ I do not know : I hope there was .
Jane Bennet	“ He meant , I believe , ” replied Jane , “ to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if anything could be made out from them .
Jane Bennet	Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .
Jane Bennet	Elizabeth felt Jane ’s pleasure .
Jane Bennet	Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .
Jane Bennet	Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .
Jane Bennet	Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .
Jane Bennet	Only think of _ that _ , my dear : he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .
Jane Bennet	I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .
Jane Bennet	So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .
Jane Bennet	Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the _
Jane Bennet	“ I do not blame Jane , ” she continued , “ for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could .
Jane Bennet	Mrs. Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ’s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and , in compassion to her nieces , turned the conversation .
Jane Bennet	“ It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , ” said she .
Jane Bennet	It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .
Jane Bennet	But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?
Jane Bennet	“ And _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London !
Jane Bennet	But does not Jane correspond with his sister ?
Jane Bennet	_ She _ will not be able to help calling . ”
Jane Bennet	“ She will drop the acquaintance entirely . ” But , in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ’s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
Jane Bennet	It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane ’s attractions .
Jane Bennet	“ So , Lizzy , ” said he , one day , “ your sister is crossed in love , I find .
Jane Bennet	When is your turn to come ?
Jane Bennet	You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane .
Jane Bennet	Now is your time .
Jane Bennet	Let Wickham be your man .
Jane Bennet	He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ” “ Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .
Jane Bennet	We must not all expect Jane ’s good fortune . ”
Jane Bennet	“ True , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .
Jane Bennet	Poor Jane !
Jane Bennet	I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .
Jane Bennet	But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?
Jane Bennet	“ I hope , ” added Mrs. Gardiner , “ that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .
Jane Bennet	We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her
Jane Bennet	“ She will drop the acquaintance entirely . ” But , in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ’s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
Jane Bennet	Two days after Mr. Bennet ’s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , “ I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . ”
Jane Bennet	Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out,-- “ Oh , papa , what news ? what news ?
Jane Bennet	Jane now came up .
Jane Bennet	It is enough to know they are discovered : I have seen them both---- ” “ Then it is as I always hoped , ” cried Jane : “ they are married ! ” Elizabeth read on : “ I have seen them both .
Jane Bennet	“ Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , ” said her sister .
Jane Bennet	“ Let me write for you , ” said Jane , “ if you dislike the trouble yourself . ” “ I dislike it very much , ” he replied ; “ but it must be done . ” And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .
Jane Bennet	my uncle ! ” cried Jane , “ what do you mean , sir ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ” replied Jane , “ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .
Jane Bennet	“ We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , ” said Jane : “ I hope and trust they will yet be happy .
Jane Bennet	His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .
Jane Bennet	Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Their conduct has been such , ” replied Elizabeth , “ as neither you , nor I , nor anybody , can ever forget .
Jane Bennet	As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner ’s hope of Lydia ’s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .
Jane Bennet	She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation .
Jane Bennet	To know that her daughter would be married was enough .
Jane Bennet	She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .
Jane Bennet	“ My dear , dear Lydia ! ” she cried : “ this is delightful indeed !
Jane Bennet	I shall see her again !
Jane Bennet	My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything .
Jane Bennet	How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too !
Jane Bennet	I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly .
Jane Bennet	Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .
Jane Bennet	Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .
Jane Bennet	Stay , stay , I will go myself .
Jane Bennet	I will put on my things in a moment .
Jane Bennet	My dear , dear Lydia !
Jane Bennet	Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner ’s behaviour laid them all under .
Jane Bennet	If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents .
Jane Bennet	My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I ca n’t write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me .
Jane Bennet	We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately .
Jane Bennet	She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted . One day ’s delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual .

One day ’s delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual .
Jane Bennet	Other schemes , too , came into her head .
Jane Bennet	“ I will go to Meryton , ” said she , “ as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .
Jane Bennet	And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long .
Jane Bennet	An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .
Jane Bennet	Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ?
Jane Bennet	My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?
Jane Bennet	Their sister ’s wedding - day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .
Jane Bennet	Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets -- and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _ she _ been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .
Jane Bennet	Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets -- and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _ she _ been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .
Jane Bennet	She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .
Jane Bennet	_ She _ blushed , and Jane blushed ; but
Jane Bennet	Her father lifted up his eyes , Jane was distressed , Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued,-- “ Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ?
Jane Bennet	She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ’s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister,-- “ Ah , Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . ”
Jane Bennet	No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .
Jane Bennet	“ If it was to be a secret , ” said Jane , “ say not another word on the subject .
Jane Bennet	“ Thank you , ” said Lydia ; “ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ” On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
Jane Bennet	Mr. Darcy had been at her sister ’s wedding .
Jane Bennet	Jane ’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
Jane Bennet	The journey would , moreover , give her a peep at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .
Jane Bennet	His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . Her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .
Jane Bennet	As they drove to Mr. Gardiner ’s door , Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival : when they entered the passage , she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .
Jane Bennet	Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute inquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .
Jane Bennet	Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ’s visit in Gracechurch Street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ’s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .
Jane Bennet	Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .
Jane Bennet	It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister ’s being in town .
Jane Bennet	Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him .
Jane Bennet	After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and , yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .
Jane Bennet	The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- “ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me .
Jane Bennet	I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable .
Jane Bennet	I am sure you will be very comfortable there . “ Yours , etc . ” This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned , as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .
Jane Bennet	His character sunk on every review of it ; and , as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry
Jane Bennet	” was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .
Jane Bennet	She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known : she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _ dislike _ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .
Jane Bennet	At night she opened her heart to Jane .
Jane Bennet	Jane looked at her doubtingly .
Jane Bennet	I know how much you dislike him . ”
Jane Bennet	“ You know nothing of the matter .
Jane Bennet	Yet now I must believe you , ” cried Jane .
Jane Bennet	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ”
Jane Bennet	But are you pleased , Jane ?
Jane Bennet	Shall you like to have such a brother ? ” “ Very , very much .
Jane Bennet	You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do when I tell you all . ”
Jane Bennet	Another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
Jane Bennet	But , Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
Jane Bennet	It is all for Jane ’s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ” During their walk , it was resolved that Mr. Bennet ’s consent should be asked in the course of the evening : Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ’s .
Jane Bennet	He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .
Jane Bennet	Jane ’s is nothing to it -- nothing at all .
Jane Bennet	“ Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane ’s . ”
Charlotte Lucas	He scarcely ever spoke to her ; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
Charlotte Lucas	The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot - pressed paper , well covered with a lady ’s fair , flowing hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ’s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
Charlotte Lucas	to join , with her usual cheerfulness , in the general conversation : but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave ,
Charlotte Lucas	Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament : it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley ’s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his . “ It is unlucky , ” said she , after a short pause , “ that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
Charlotte Lucas	She represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . Jane ’s temper was not desponding ; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart .
Charlotte Lucas	Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
Charlotte Lucas	Miss Lucas is married and settled : and one of my own daughters .
Charlotte Lucas	It was only said , ‘ Lately , George Wickham , Esq . , to Miss Lydia Bennet , ’ without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything .
Charlotte Lucas	That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .
Charlotte Lucas	“ _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , ” said Mrs. Bennet , with civil self - command , to Miss Lucas .
Charlotte Lucas	“ _ You _ were Mr. Bingley ’s first choice . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . ” “ Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice .
Charlotte Lucas	-- indeed , I rather believe he _ did_--I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . ” “ Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson : did not I mention it to you ?
Charlotte Lucas	Well , that was very decided , indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know .
Charlotte Lucas	“ _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Eliza , ” said Charlotte .
Charlotte Lucas	“ I beg you will not put it into Lizzy ’s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .
Charlotte Lucas	Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I do not believe a word of it , my dear .
Charlotte Lucas	But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise .
Charlotte Lucas	“ I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , ” said Miss Lucas , “ but I wish he had danced with Eliza . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Another time , Lizzy , ” said her mother , “ I would not dance with _ him _ , if I were you . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I believe , ma’am , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ His pride , ” said Miss Lucas , “ does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .
Charlotte Lucas	If I may so express it , he has a _ right _ to be proud . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ You forget that I have made no answer .
Charlotte Lucas	And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,-- “ When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ”
Charlotte Lucas	On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Charlotte Lucas	He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins ’s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings , and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _ there _ too .
Charlotte Lucas	“ What is it you mean ?
Charlotte Lucas	Mrs. Collins ,
Charlotte Lucas	Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ’s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _ her _ coming away .
Charlotte Lucas	“ Yes , she called yesterday with her father .
Charlotte Lucas	quite mistake the matter . ” “ Did Charlotte dine with you ? ” “ No , she would go home .
Charlotte Lucas	I fancy she was wanted about the mince - pies .
Charlotte Lucas	Not that _ I _ think Charlotte so _ very _ plain ; but then she is our particular friend .
Charlotte Lucas	“ She seems a very pleasant young woman , ” said Bingley .
Charlotte Lucas	“ Oh dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain .
Charlotte Lucas	Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime .
Charlotte Lucas	She inquired into Charlotte ’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all ; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .
Charlotte Lucas	For your sake , ” turning to Charlotte , “ I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .
Charlotte Lucas	As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ’s sake , she made more favourable than it really was .
Charlotte Lucas	Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them : anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs. Collins ’s pretty friend had , moreover , caught his fancy very much .
Charlotte Lucas	He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy .
Charlotte Lucas	I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson ’s room .
Charlotte Lucas	She would be in nobody ’s way , you know , in that part of the house . ”
Charlotte Lucas	from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh
Charlotte Lucas	she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _ her _ , had she been his relation .
Charlotte Lucas	I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in ; and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her .
Charlotte Lucas	I do not believe she often sees such at home . ” “ The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger . ” Mrs. Bennet ’s eyes sparkled .
Charlotte Lucas	What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another , of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
Charlotte Lucas	First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .
Charlotte Lucas	I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .
Charlotte Lucas	She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .
Charlotte Lucas	Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins .
Charlotte Lucas	Everything , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ’s first sketch .
Charlotte Lucas	Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ” “ If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . ” “ She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .
Charlotte Lucas	The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte ’s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and , while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .
Lydia Bennet	Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
Lydia Bennet	The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions
Lydia Bennet	Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . “ I am astonished , my dear , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .
Lydia Bennet	“ Mamma , ” cried Lydia , “ my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson ’s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke ’s library . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ With the officers ! ” cried Lydia : “ I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . ” “ Dining out , ” said Mrs. Bennet ; “ that is very unlucky . ” “ Can I have the carriage ? ” said Jane .
Lydia Bennet	“ We will go as far as Meryton with you , ” said Catherine and Lydia .
Lydia Bennet	“ If we make haste , ” said Lydia , as they walked along , “ perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter , before he goes . ”
Lydia Bennet	With many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs. Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed,-- “ Good Lord !
Lydia Bennet	Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .
Lydia Bennet	Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Lydia Bennet	Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family .
Lydia Bennet	“ I am sure I shall break _ mine _ , ” said Lydia .
Lydia Bennet	But the gloom of Lydia ’s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .
Lydia Bennet	A resemblance in good - humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their _ three _ months ’ acquaintance they had been intimate _ two _ .
Lydia Bennet	The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs. Forster , the delight of Mrs. Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described .
Lydia Bennet	Wholly inattentive to her sister ’s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone ’s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . “ I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , ” said she , “ though I am _ not _ her particular friend .
Lydia Bennet	As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her , were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .
Lydia Bennet	She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia ’s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
Lydia Bennet	He heard her attentively , and then said,-- “ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ If you were aware , ” said Elizabeth , “ of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ’s unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ” “ Already arisen ! ” repeated Mr. Bennet .
Lydia Bennet	“ What ! has she frightened away some of your lovers ?
Lydia Bennet	Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ’s folly . ”
Lydia Bennet	Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ’s character .
Lydia Bennet	If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .
Lydia Bennet	Her character will be fixed ; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .
Lydia Bennet	She will follow wherever Lydia leads .
Lydia Bennet	We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .
Lydia Bennet	Let her go , then .
Lydia Bennet	Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody .
Lydia Bennet	At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .
Lydia Bennet	Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .
Lydia Bennet	At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ” With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .
Lydia Bennet	Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .
Lydia Bennet	In Lydia ’s imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .
Lydia Bennet	She saw , with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing - place covered with officers .
Lydia Bennet	She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .
Lydia Bennet	She saw all the glories of the camp : its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and , to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .
Lydia Bennet	Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?
Lydia Bennet	have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .
Lydia Bennet	Lydia ’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ’s never intending to go there himself .
Lydia Bennet	But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued , with little intermission , to the very day of Lydia ’s leaving home .
Lydia Bennet	The rest of the evening passed with the _ appearance _ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .
Lydia Bennet	The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .
Lydia Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and , in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .
Lydia Bennet	Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters
Lydia Bennet	put herself forward .
Lydia Bennet	The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit ; and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .
Lydia Bennet	Lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .
Lydia Bennet	She had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ’s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .
Lydia Bennet	She was very equal , therefore , to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .
Lydia Bennet	His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother ’s ear .
Lydia Bennet	“ I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball .
Lydia Bennet	But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ? ” Lydia declared herself satisfied .
Lydia Bennet	And when you have given _ your _ ball , ” she added , “ I shall insist on their giving one also .
Lydia Bennet	I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . ”
Lydia Bennet	The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person ; for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham
Lydia Bennet	Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia .
Lydia Bennet	there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent .
Lydia Bennet	Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and Mr. Collins , in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .
Lydia Bennet	Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ’s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?
Lydia Bennet	Catherine , weak - spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia ’s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self - willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .
Lydia Bennet	Lydia ’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten : every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr. Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr. Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr. Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .
Lydia Bennet	The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .
Lydia Bennet	All were struck with the stranger ’s air , all wondered who he could be ; and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement , when the two gentlemen , turning back , had reached the same spot .
Lydia Bennet	Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips ’s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ’s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs. Philips ’s throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .
Lydia Bennet	She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “ stupid , disagreeable fellows .
Lydia Bennet	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia ’s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr. Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill - will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .
Lydia Bennet	Lydia , my love , ring the bell .
Lydia Bennet	To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .
Lydia Bennet	XXXIX . It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ---- , in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet ’s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ’s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room upstairs .
Lydia Bennet	“ And we mean to treat you all , ” added Lydia ; “ but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . ”
Lydia Bennet	Then showing her purchases,--“Look here , I have bought this bonnet .
Lydia Bennet	I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not .
Lydia Bennet	I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . ”
Lydia Bennet	And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , “ Oh , but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable .
Lydia Bennet	“ Now I have got some news for you , ” said Lydia , as they sat down to table .
Lydia Bennet	Lydia laughed , and said,-- “ Ay , that is just like your formality and discretion .
Lydia Bennet	I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say .
Lydia Bennet	I am glad he is gone .
Lydia Bennet	I never saw such a long chin in my life .
Lydia Bennet	Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ?
Lydia Bennet	As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and , after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty ’s and Lydia ’s purchases , were seated in it .
Lydia Bennet	“ How nicely we are crammed in ! ” cried Lydia .
Lydia Bennet	“ I am glad I brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band - box !
Lydia Bennet	” With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ’s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .
Lydia Bennet	Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ’s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . “ Oh , Mary , ” said she , “ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .
Lydia Bennet	I thought we never should have got into the coach .
Lydia Bennet	I was ready to die of laughter .
Lydia Bennet	To this , Mary very gravely replied , “ Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .
Lydia Bennet	But I confess they would have no charms for _ me _ .
Lydia Bennet	I should infinitely prefer a book . ”
Lydia Bennet	But of this answer Lydia heard not a word .
Lydia Bennet	She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all .
Lydia Bennet	In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton , and see how everybody went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .
Lydia Bennet	She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .
Lydia Bennet	And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?
Lydia Bennet	As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
Lydia Bennet	Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ’s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? ” “ It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , ” replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , “ that a sister ’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .
Lydia Bennet	“ But does Lydia know nothing of this ?
Lydia Bennet	can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? ”
Lydia Bennet	And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .
Lydia Bennet	That _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .
Lydia Bennet	When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .
Lydia Bennet	The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce the marriage .
Lydia Bennet	Mrs. Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes ’ conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill - usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill - judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .
Lydia Bennet	“ If I had been able , ” said she , “ to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .
Lydia Bennet	Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?
Lydia Bennet	I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .
Lydia Bennet	I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am .
Lydia Bennet	The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . “ Do not give way to useless alarm , ” added he : “ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .
Lydia Bennet	And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married .
Lydia Bennet	And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .
Lydia Bennet	The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty .
Lydia Bennet	But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . ” Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , “ Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . ” Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .
Lydia Bennet	“ Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ’s side , but nothing to give him any alarm .
Lydia Bennet	Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ’s last letter she had prepared her for such a step .
Lydia Bennet	“ Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ’s note to his wife ? ”
Lydia Bennet	the surprise the greater when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham
Lydia Bennet	“ Your affectionate friend , “ LYDIA BENNET . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Oh , thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! ” cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .
Lydia Bennet	“ Your attendance upon her has been too much for you .
Lydia Bennet	Perhaps I am not doing her justice .
Lydia Bennet	But she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .
Lydia Bennet	She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .
Lydia Bennet	Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .
Lydia Bennet	She has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough .
Lydia Bennet	Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .
Lydia Bennet	“ I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Wickham ’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds : I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . ”
Lydia Bennet	Oh , Lydia ! ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ” replied Jane , “ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .
Lydia Bennet	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ” said Elizabeth , “ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .
Lydia Bennet	Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge .
Lydia Bennet	By this time she is actually with them !
Lydia Bennet	If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !
Lydia Bennet	What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! ”
Lydia Bennet	His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .
Lydia Bennet	As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner ’s hope of Lydia ’s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .
Lydia Bennet	To know that her daughter would be married was enough .
Lydia Bennet	She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .
Lydia Bennet	“ My dear , dear Lydia ! ” she cried : “ this is delightful indeed !
Lydia Bennet	She will
Lydia Bennet	I shall see her again !
Lydia Bennet	She will be married at sixteen !
Lydia Bennet	How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too !
Lydia Bennet	My dear , dear Lydia !
Lydia Bennet	“ Well , ” cried her mother , “ it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?
Lydia Bennet	Mrs. Wickham !
Lydia Bennet	Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding .
Lydia Bennet	Poor Lydia ’s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .
Lydia Bennet	She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness , nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .
Lydia Bennet	Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets -- and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _ she _ been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .
Lydia Bennet	Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .
Lydia Bennet	Lydia ’s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .
Lydia Bennet	Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness .
Lydia Bennet	Lydia was Lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .
Lydia Bennet	She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .
Lydia Bennet	with a good - humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her
Lydia Bennet	Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .
Lydia Bennet	“ Only think of its being three months , ” she cried , “ since I went away : it seems but a fortnight , I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .
Lydia Bennet	when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again !
Lydia Bennet	though I thought it would be very good fun if I was .
Lydia Bennet	Her father lifted up his eyes , Jane was distressed , Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued,-- “ Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ?
Lydia Bennet	She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ’s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister,-- “ Ah , Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . ”
Lydia Bennet	It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first .
Lydia Bennet	Her ease and good spirits increased .
Lydia Bennet	She longed to see Mrs. Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called “ Mrs. Wickham ” by each of them ; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids . “ Well , mamma , ” said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast - room , “ and what do you think of my husband ?
Lydia Bennet	I am sure my sisters must all envy me .
Lydia Bennet	I only hope they may have half my good luck .
Lydia Bennet	But , my dear Lydia , I do n’t at all like your going such a way off .
Lydia Bennet	You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .
Lydia Bennet	“ I should like it beyond anything ! ” said her mother .
Lydia Bennet	“ And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them
Lydia Bennet	No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .
Lydia Bennet	Wickham ’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ’s for him .
Lydia Bennet	She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .
Lydia Bennet	He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .
Lydia Bennet	He did everything best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September than anybody else in the country .
Lydia Bennet	“ Thank you , ” said Lydia ; “ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ” On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
Lydia Bennet	She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropped , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
Lydia Bennet	“ You may readily comprehend , ” she added , “ what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ”
Lydia Bennet	Jane ’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
Lydia Bennet	She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend : but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia ’s marriage .
Lydia Bennet	To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .
Charles Bingley	“ I found , ” said he , “ as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .
Charles Bingley	Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament : it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley ’s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his . “ It is unlucky , ” said she , after a short pause , “ that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them . ”
Charles Bingley	‘ Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and to confess the truth , _ we _ are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
Charles Bingley	Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
Charles Bingley	But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ inter - marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .
Charles Bingley	But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ”
Charles Bingley	“ But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ” “ You must decide for yourself , ” said Elizabeth ; “ and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you , by all means , to refuse him . ” “ How can you talk so ? ” said Jane , faintly smiling ; “ you must know , that , though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . ” “ I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . ” “ But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .
Charles Bingley	The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .
Charles Bingley	She represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . Jane ’s temper was not desponding ; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart .
Charles Bingley	They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ’s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern ,
Charles Bingley	After lamenting it , however , at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again , and soon dining at Longbourn ; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .
Charles Bingley	With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley , and talked of Mrs. Darcy , may be guessed .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .
Charles Bingley	So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart .
Charles Bingley	The darling wish of his sisters
Charles Bingley	was then gratified : he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire ; and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Philips ’s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs. Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ’s good - humour encouraged ; yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar .
Charles Bingley	LV . A few days after this visit , Mr. Bingley called again , and alone .
Charles Bingley	His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days ’ time .
Charles Bingley	He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .
Charles Bingley	“ Next time you call , ” said she , “ I hope we shall be more lucky . ” He should be particularly happy at any time , etc . , etc . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .
Charles Bingley	“ Can you come to - morrow ?
Charles Bingley	Yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .
Charles Bingley	He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .
Charles Bingley	He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come .
Charles Bingley	He is , indeed .
Charles Bingley	After tea , Mr. Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went upstairs to her instrument .
Charles Bingley	Bingley was everything that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .
Charles Bingley	He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet ’s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .
Charles Bingley	Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time .
Charles Bingley	Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ’s concurrence .
Charles Bingley	Bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .
Charles Bingley	The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .
Charles Bingley	There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him .
Charles Bingley	Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet ’s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter .
Charles Bingley	On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all .
Charles Bingley	Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and , whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .
Charles Bingley	He is gone to my father already .
Charles Bingley	Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . “ And this , ” said she , “ is the end of all his friend ’s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ’s falsehood and contrivance !
Charles Bingley	In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .
Charles Bingley	“ Where is your sister ? ” said he hastily , as he opened the door .
Charles Bingley	“ With my mother upstairs .
Charles Bingley	She will be down in a moment , I dare say . ”
Charles Bingley	He then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .
Charles Bingley	They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of Jane ’s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was .
Charles Bingley	Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said,-- “ Jane , I congratulate you .
Charles Bingley	Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .
Charles Bingley	“ You are a good girl , ” he replied , “ and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .
Charles Bingley	I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .
Charles Bingley	My dear Mr. Bennet , ” cried his wife , “ what are you talking of ?
Charles Bingley	I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .
Charles Bingley	Oh , he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! ”
Charles Bingley	Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .
Charles Bingley	Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else : but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .
Charles Bingley	In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .
Charles Bingley	“ He has made me so happy , ” said she , one evening , “ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !
Charles Bingley	“ But how did he account for it ? ”
Charles Bingley	“ It must have been his sisters ’ doing .
Charles Bingley	They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .
Charles Bingley	But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . ”
Charles Bingley	“ Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ” “ He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . ”
Charles Bingley	This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .
Charles Bingley	Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
Charles Bingley	Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune , and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty .
Charles Bingley	It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and , quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge ; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .
Charles Bingley	For , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody .
Charles Bingley	By nature inoffensive , friendly , and obliging , his presentation at St. James ’s had made him courteous .
Charles Bingley	Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet .
Charles Bingley	“ _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , ” said Mrs. Bennet , with civil self - command , to Miss Lucas .
Charles Bingley	“ _ You _ were Mr. Bingley ’s first choice . ”
Charles Bingley	“ Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . ” “ Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice .
Charles Bingley	To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her
Charles Bingley	-- indeed , I rather believe he _ did_--I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . ” “ Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson : did not I mention it to you ?
Charles Bingley	Mr. Robinson ’s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , ‘ Oh , the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . ’ ”
Charles Bingley	_ ] ] “ Are you quite sure , ma’am ? Is not there a little mistake ? ” said Jane .
Charles Bingley	” “ If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , ” cried a young Lucas , who came with his sisters , “ I should not care how proud I was .
Charles Bingley	I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .
Charles Bingley	“ Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , ” said Mrs. Bennet ; “ and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly .
Charles Bingley	The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would ; and the argument ended only with the visit .
Charles Bingley	Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .
Charles Bingley	Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley ’s continued absence .
Charles Bingley	Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that
Charles Bingley	his
Charles Bingley	would be successful in keeping him away
Charles Bingley	The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters , and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
Charles Bingley	But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill - used .
Charles Bingley	She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Charles Bingley	“ Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself . ” “ No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . ”
Charles Bingley	“ I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley ’s sincerity , ” said Elizabeth warmly , “ but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bingley ’s defence of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . ” She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
Charles Bingley	Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ’s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
Charles Bingley	On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Charles Bingley	To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough ; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Charles Bingley	They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation , and , by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins , who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .
Charles Bingley	Bingley was all grateful pleasure ; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Charles Bingley	She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when , hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said,-- “ By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
Charles Bingley	Anxiety on Jane ’s behalf was another prevailing concern ; and Mr. Darcy ’s explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .
Charles Bingley	The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street . On distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .
Charles Bingley	Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .
Charles Bingley	In another minute Mr. Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .
Charles Bingley	It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure .
Charles Bingley	Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley .
Charles Bingley	” “ It is _ not _ Mr. Bingley , ” said her husband ; “ it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . ” This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .
Charles Bingley	We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman ’s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun !
Charles Bingley	When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .
Charles Bingley	but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of Bingley , and _ her _ being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea .
Charles Bingley	Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .
Charles Bingley	Not all that Mrs. Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject , was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley .
Charles Bingley	They attacked him in various ways , with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour , Lady Lucas .
Charles Bingley	Sir William had been delighted with him .
Charles Bingley	He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and , to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .
Charles Bingley	was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley ’s heart were entertained .
Charles Bingley	“ If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , ” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband , “ and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . ”
Charles Bingley	In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet ’s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .
Charles Bingley	He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .
Charles Bingley	The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining , from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .
Charles Bingley	An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched ; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , etc .
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted .
Charles Bingley	She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might always be flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .
Charles Bingley	Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his [ Illustration : “ When the Party entered ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that , instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . And when the party entered the assembly - room , it consisted of only five altogether : Mr. Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bingley was good - looking and gentlemanlike : he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .
Charles Bingley	His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .
Charles Bingley	His brother - in - law , Mr. Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien , and the report , which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .
Charles Bingley	The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room : he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .
Charles Bingley	What a contrast between him and his friend !
Charles Bingley	Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .
Charles Bingley	Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it .
Charles Bingley	Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . ”
Charles Bingley	“ _ You _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , ” said Mr. Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .
Charles Bingley	“ Oh , she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld !
Charles Bingley	But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable .
Charles Bingley	Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . ”
Charles Bingley	[ Illustration : “ She is tolerable ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bingley followed his advice .
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .
Charles Bingley	Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .
Charles Bingley	Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .
Charles Bingley	They found Mr. Bennet still up .
Charles Bingley	With a book , he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a
Charles Bingley	He had rather hoped that all his wife ’s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .
Charles Bingley	“ Oh , my dear Mr. Bennet , ” as she entered the room , “ we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .
Charles Bingley	I wish you had been there .
Charles Bingley	Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .
Charles Bingley	Only think of _ that _ , my dear : he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .
Charles Bingley	First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .
Charles Bingley	I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .
Charles Bingley	So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .
Charles Bingley	Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the _
Charles Bingley	” “ If he had had any compassion for _ me _ , ” cried her husband impatiently , “ he would not have danced half so much !
Charles Bingley	For God ’s sake , say no more of his partners .
Charles Bingley	O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! ”
Charles Bingley	“ Oh , my dear , ” continued Mrs. Bennet , “ I am quite delighted with him .
Charles Bingley	He is so excessively handsome !
Charles Bingley	and his sisters are charming women .
Charles Bingley	I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses .
Charles Bingley	I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst ’s gown----
Charles Bingley	Here she was interrupted again .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery .
Charles Bingley	She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit , and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy .
Charles Bingley	“ But I can assure you , ” she added , “ that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .
Charles Bingley	I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs .
Charles Bingley	I quite detest the man . ”
Charles Bingley	After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .
Charles Bingley	The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .
Charles Bingley	He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .
Charles Bingley	On the following Monday , Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came , as usual , to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Gardiner was a sensible , gentlemanlike man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips ,
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .
Charles Bingley	They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister
Charles Bingley	Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .
Charles Bingley	“ I do not blame Jane , ” she continued , “ for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could .
Charles Bingley	Oh , sister !
Charles Bingley	it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins ’s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .
Charles Bingley	He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .
Charles Bingley	The Lucases are very artful people , indeed , sister .
Charles Bingley	However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves . ”
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ’s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and , in compassion to her nieces , turned the conversation .
Charles Bingley	A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and , when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . ”
Charles Bingley	Pray , how _ violent was _ Mr. Bingley ’s love ? ”
Charles Bingley	“ I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .
Charles Bingley	At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance ; and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer .
Charles Bingley	Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? ” “ Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .
Charles Bingley	Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . ” Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ’s ready acquiescence .
Charles Bingley	We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her
Charles Bingley	“ And _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London !
Charles Bingley	Mr. Darcy may , perhaps , have _ heard _ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and , depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . ”
Charles Bingley	But does not Jane correspond with his sister ?
Charles Bingley	“ She will drop the acquaintance entirely . ” But , in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ’s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
Charles Bingley	It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane ’s attractions .
Charles Bingley	Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ’s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped , by Caroline ’s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .
Charles Bingley	They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ’s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring . Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well .
Charles Bingley	In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor
Charles Bingley	, she was delighting both him and herself .
Charles Bingley	On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy ’s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ’s reputed disposition , when quite a lad , which might agree with it ; and was confident , at last , that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy .
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Bennet ’s best comfort was , that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer .
Charles Bingley	Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently .
Charles Bingley	“ So , Lizzy , ” said he , one day , “ your sister is crossed in love , I find .
Charles Bingley	I congratulate her .
Charles Bingley	It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .
Charles Bingley	He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ” “ Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .
Charles Bingley	“ True , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .
Charles Bingley	The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr. Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy
Charles Bingley	Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of Hertfordshire : her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes ; but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .
Charles Bingley	I inquired after their brother , of course .
Charles Bingley	He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him .
Charles Bingley	But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .
Charles Bingley	I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable .
Charles Bingley	I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .
Charles Bingley	He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .
Charles Bingley	Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .
Charles Bingley	All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .
Charles Bingley	She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .
Charles Bingley	His character sunk on every review of it ; and , as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry
Charles Bingley	Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .
Charles Bingley	His
Charles Bingley	had subsided , his attentions were over
Charles Bingley	, he was the admirer of some one else .
Charles Bingley	Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _ she _ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .
Charles Bingley	The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte ’s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and , while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .
Charles Bingley	All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner ; and , after relating the circumstances , she thus went on:--“I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .
Charles Bingley	But my feelings are not only cordial towards _ him _ , they are even impartial towards Miss King .
Charles Bingley	My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .
Charles Bingley	Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .
Charles Bingley	[ Illustration : “ He came down to see the place ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen .
Charles Bingley	“ Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . ”
Charles Bingley	“ What is his name ? ” “ Bingley . ”
Charles Bingley	“ Is he married or single ? ”
Charles Bingley	A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .
Charles Bingley	You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . ”
Charles Bingley	“ Is that his design in settling here ? ” “ Design ?
Charles Bingley	But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him
Charles Bingley	as soon as he comes
Charles Bingley	, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party . ”
Charles Bingley	“ But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . ” “ It is more than I engage for , I assure you . ” “ But consider your daughters .
Charles Bingley	Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him , if you do not . ”
Charles Bingley	I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls -- though
Charles Bingley	[ Illustration : “ I hope Mr. Bingley will like it ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen .
Charles Bingley	Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .
Charles Bingley	“ What do you mean ? ” “ Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley .
Charles Bingley	Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ’s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .
Charles Bingley	She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend : but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia ’s marriage .
Charles Bingley	“ Good gracious ! ” cried Mrs. Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , “ if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !
Charles Bingley	Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ’s way . ”
Charles Bingley	Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , “ Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? ”
Charles Bingley	It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . ” “ It may do very well for the others , ” replied Mr. Bingley ; “ but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .
Caroline Bingley	When they had gained their own room , Jane , taking out her letter , said , “ This is from Caroline Bingley : what it contains has surprised me a good deal .
Caroline Bingley	You shall hear what she says . ”
Caroline Bingley	But may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?
Caroline Bingley	“ It is evident by this , ” added Jane , “ that he comes back no more this winter . ” “ It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . ” “ Why will you think so ?
Caroline Bingley	Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .
Caroline Bingley	She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . ”
Caroline Bingley	can doubt his affection ; Miss Bingley , I am sure , can not : she is not such a simpleton .
Caroline Bingley	Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
Caroline Bingley	But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ inter - marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .
Caroline Bingley	But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , ” replied Jane , “ your representation of all this might make me quite easy .
Caroline Bingley	Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet .
Caroline Bingley	Mr. Robinson ’s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , ‘ Oh , the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . ’ ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Miss Bingley told me , ” said Jane , “ that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .
Caroline Bingley	They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and , with an expression of civil disdain , thus accosted her,-- “ So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ?
Caroline Bingley	They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley ’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .
Caroline Bingley	He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation ; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was “ very glad ; ” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley ’s salutation .
Caroline Bingley	The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed , at his desire , to the other side of the fireplace , that she might be farther from the door .
Caroline Bingley	He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to anyone else .
Caroline Bingley	Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs. Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ’s conversation with Miss Bennet .
Caroline Bingley	Miss Bingley ’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy ’s progress through _ his _ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .
Caroline Bingley	She could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question and read on .
Caroline Bingley	At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , “ How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !
Caroline Bingley	I declare , after all , there is no enjoyment like reading !
Caroline Bingley	When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . ”
Caroline Bingley	She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when , hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said,-- “ By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?
Caroline Bingley	I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ”
Caroline Bingley	Miss Bingley made no answer , and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .
Caroline Bingley	Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .
Caroline Bingley	In the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said,-- “ Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .
Caroline Bingley	I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . ”
Caroline Bingley	Miss Bingley
Caroline Bingley	succeeded no less in the real object of her civility : Mr. Darcy looked up .
Caroline Bingley	She was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him .
Caroline Bingley	“ Not at all , ” was her answer ; “ but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
Caroline Bingley	Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything , and persevered , therefore , in requiring an explanation of his two motives .
Caroline Bingley	“ I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , ” said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .
Caroline Bingley	“ Oh , shocking ! ” cried Miss Bingley .
Caroline Bingley	“ I never heard anything so abominable .
Caroline Bingley	How shall we punish him for such a speech ? ” “ Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , ” said Elizabeth .
Caroline Bingley	Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . ” “ But upon my honour I do _ not _ .
Caroline Bingley	I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ .
Caroline Bingley	“ Miss Bingley , ” said he , “ has given me credit for more than can be .
Caroline Bingley	“ Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , ” said Miss Bingley ; “ and pray what is the result ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect .
Caroline Bingley	“ And yours , ” he replied , with a smile , “ is wilfully to misunderstand them . ” “ Do let us have a little music , ” cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .
Caroline Bingley	“ Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . ”
Caroline Bingley	Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened ; and Darcy , after a few moments ’ recollection , was not sorry for it .
Caroline Bingley	Miss Bingley saw , or suspected , enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .
Caroline Bingley	“ I hope , ” said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , “ you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , to cure the younger girls of running after the officers .
Caroline Bingley	And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ” [ Illustration : “ No , no ; stay where you are ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _
Caroline Bingley	Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ’s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .
Caroline Bingley	After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ’s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .
Caroline Bingley	Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .
Caroline Bingley	“ Removed ! ” cried Bingley .
Caroline Bingley	My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ You may depend upon it , madam , ” said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , “ that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . ”
Caroline Bingley	You have a sweet room here , Mr. Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .
Caroline Bingley	You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Whatever I do is done in a hurry , ” replied he ; “ and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .
Caroline Bingley	At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . ” “ That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , ” said Elizabeth .
Caroline Bingley	“ You begin to comprehend me , do you ? ” cried he , turning towards her .
Caroline Bingley	“ Oh yes -- I understand you perfectly . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Lizzy , ” cried her mother , “ remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . ” “ I did not know before , ” continued Bingley , immediately , “ that you were a studier of character .
Caroline Bingley	The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr. Bingley ?
Caroline Bingley	“ When I am in the country , ” he replied , “ I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town , it is pretty much the same .
Caroline Bingley	They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .
Caroline Bingley	Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance .
Caroline Bingley	His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile .
Caroline Bingley	What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr. Bingley -- is not he ?
Caroline Bingley	quite mistake the matter . ” “ Did Charlotte dine with you ? ” “ No , she would go home .
Caroline Bingley	For my part , Mr. Bingley , _ I _ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _ my _ daughters are brought up differently .
Caroline Bingley	“ She seems a very pleasant young woman , ” said Bingley .
Caroline Bingley	“ Oh dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain .
Caroline Bingley	She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .
Caroline Bingley	Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .
Caroline Bingley	The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit ; and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .
Caroline Bingley	She was very equal , therefore , to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .
Caroline Bingley	His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother ’s ear .
Caroline Bingley	“ I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball .
Caroline Bingley	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _ her _ , in spite of all Miss Bingley ’s witticisms on _ fine eyes _ .
Caroline Bingley	Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ’s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ’s side the acquaintance would now be renewed .
Caroline Bingley	In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .
Caroline Bingley	Georgiana ’s reception of them was very civil , but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . Mrs. Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
Caroline Bingley	By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .
Caroline Bingley	It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well - bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Caroline Bingley	Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .
Caroline Bingley	Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her .
Caroline Bingley	After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ’s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family .
Caroline Bingley	The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
Caroline Bingley	No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ’s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr. Darcy
Caroline Bingley	Miss Darcy , on her brother ’s entrance
Caroline Bingley	, exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
Caroline Bingley	Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility,-- “ Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ?
Caroline Bingley	While she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Caroline Bingley	Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ’s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Caroline Bingley	Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ’s meditated elopement .
Caroline Bingley	To no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ’s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .
Caroline Bingley	He had certainly formed such a plan ; and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
Caroline Bingley	Elizabeth ’s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Caroline Bingley	When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
Caroline Bingley	“ How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , ” she cried : “ I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter .
Caroline Bingley	She is grown so brown and coarse !
Caroline Bingley	Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again .
Caroline Bingley	However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
Caroline Bingley	“ For my own part , ” she rejoined , “ I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .
Caroline Bingley	Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .
Caroline Bingley	Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .
Caroline Bingley	Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them .
Caroline Bingley	They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ”
Caroline Bingley	Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
Caroline Bingley	He was resolutely silent , however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued,-- “ I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ‘ _ She _ a beauty !
Caroline Bingley	I should as soon call her mother a wit . ’
Caroline Bingley	But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Yes , ” replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , “ but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .
Caroline Bingley	He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .
Caroline Bingley	Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .
Caroline Bingley	They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of everything but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ’s beginning the subject .
Caroline Bingley	There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant , who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .
Caroline Bingley	It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ’s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley -- for she had reached it only to a late breakfast -- ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . They were , therefore , to go .
Caroline Bingley	On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .
Caroline Bingley	Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ’s visit in Gracechurch Street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ’s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .
Caroline Bingley	“ But , my dear Elizabeth , ” she added , “ what sort of girl is Miss King ?
Caroline Bingley	Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ” “ If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . ” “ She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .
Caroline Bingley	I know no harm of her . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather ’s death made her mistress of this fortune ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . ” “ A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .
Caroline Bingley	“ _ Her _ not objecting does not justify _ him _ .
Caroline Bingley	It only shows her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling . ”
Caroline Bingley	_ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . ”
Caroline Bingley	She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .
Caroline Bingley	I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner : I wish I could see her .
Caroline Bingley	It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister ’s being in town .
Caroline Bingley	Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him .
Caroline Bingley	She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ’s inattention .
Caroline Bingley	After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and , yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .
Caroline Bingley	The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- “ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me .
Caroline Bingley	But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .
Caroline Bingley	I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .
Caroline Bingley	I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .
Caroline Bingley	He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .
Caroline Bingley	Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .
Caroline Bingley	I am sure you will be very comfortable there . “ Yours , etc . ” This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned , as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .
Caroline Bingley	But my feelings are not only cordial towards _ him _ , they are even impartial towards Miss King .
Caroline Bingley	I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .
Caroline Bingley	Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .
Caroline Bingley	“ I did not think Caroline in spirits , ” were her words , “ but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .
Caroline Bingley	I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .
Caroline Bingley	My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out .
Caroline Bingley	Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime .
Caroline Bingley	When she
Caroline Bingley	did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was , in every respect , so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .
Caroline Bingley	I pity , though I can not help blaming , her .
Caroline Bingley	She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .
Caroline Bingley	But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .
Caroline Bingley	I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable .
Georgiana Darcy	‘ Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and to confess the truth , _ we _ are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
Georgiana Darcy	I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
Georgiana Darcy	My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister ’s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ’s heart .
Georgiana Darcy	But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present ; and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ”
Georgiana Darcy	I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . ” “ Are you , indeed ?
Georgiana Darcy	Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ” As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly ; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
Georgiana Darcy	I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
Georgiana Darcy	She is a
Georgiana Darcy	“ It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ’s family it would be an unpleasant thing . ” “ You may depend upon my not mentioning it . ” “ And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .
Georgiana Darcy	“ I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ” “ And what arts did he use to separate them ? ” “ He did not talk to me of his own arts , ” said Fitzwilliam , smiling .
Georgiana Darcy	That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Georgiana Darcy	“ There were some very strong objections against the lady , ” were Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s words ; and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .
Georgiana Darcy	When she thought of her mother , indeed , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections _ there _ had material weight with Mr. Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ’s connections than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister .
Georgiana Darcy	When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room , where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .
Georgiana Darcy	When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table -- but in vain .
Georgiana Darcy	Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened ; and Darcy , after a few moments ’ recollection , was not sorry for it .
Georgiana Darcy	And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ” [ Illustration : “ No , no ; stay where you are ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _
Georgiana Darcy	Georgiana ’s reception of them was very civil , but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . Mrs. Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
Georgiana Darcy	He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river ; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .
Georgiana Darcy	Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits ; and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added,-- “ But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .
Georgiana Darcy	Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . ”
Georgiana Darcy	Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . ”
Georgiana Darcy	The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt .
Georgiana Darcy	When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her .
Georgiana Darcy	How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? ” Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ’s proficiency .
Georgiana Darcy	“ I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , ” said Lady Catherine ; “ and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ I assure you , madam , ” he replied , “ that she does not need such advice .
Georgiana Darcy	She practises very constantly . ”
Georgiana Darcy	It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .
Georgiana Darcy	Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ’s ill - breeding , and made no answer .
Georgiana Darcy	But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well .
Georgiana Darcy	Elizabeth looked at Darcy , to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ’s praise : but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Bennet ’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed , in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother ’s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr. Bingley ’s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If I wished to think slightingly of anybody ’s children , it should not be of my own , however . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	What does he say ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Oh , but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley ’s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are not they ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Well , my dear , ” said Mr. Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , “ if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Oh , I am not at all afraid of her dying .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I would go and see her if I could have the carriage .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy said very little , and Mr. Hurst nothing at all .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . ” He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner ; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed along .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ He is as fine a fellow , ” said Mr. Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , “ as ever I saw .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am prodigiously proud of him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , ” ( for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news ) .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And so , it is quite certain he is coming ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He comes down on Thursday , at the latest , very likely on Wednesday .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said,-- “ I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed ; but do n’t imagine it was from any silly cause .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _ with _ his friend ’s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Yet it is hard , ” she sometimes thought , “ that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I _ will _ leave him to himself . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ you will wait on him , of course . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ’s errand again . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . “ ’ Tis an _ etiquette _ I despise , ” said he .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ If he wants our society , let him seek it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He knows where we live .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I will not spend _ my _ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But , however , that sha n’t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ’s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley , in consequence of it , before _ they _ did .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	As the day of his arrival drew near,-- “ I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , ” said Jane to her sister .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference ; but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over ! ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Bingley arrived .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent -- hopeless of seeing him before .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked -- she saw Mr. Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . “ There is a gentleman with him , mamma , ” said Kitty ; “ who can it be ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ La ! ” replied Kitty , “ it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. what ’s his name -- that tall , proud man . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley ’s will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else I must
Fitzwilliam Darcy	say that I hate the very sight of him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley ’s friend , without being heard by either of them .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner ’s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merits she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken ; but she would not be secure .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Let me first see how he behaves , ” said she ; “ it will then be early enough for expectation . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He looked serious as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But , perhaps , he could not in her mother ’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Darcy , after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did -- a question which she could not answer without confusion -- said scarcely anything .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was not seated by her : perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	There he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Yet why did he come ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She inquired after his sister , but could do no more . “ It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , ” said Mrs. Bennet .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He readily agreed to it . “ I began to be afraid you would never come back again .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It was my brother Gardiner ’s drawing up , too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	How Mr. Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , ” continued her mother ; “ but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken away from me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the Regulars .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	he has _ some _ friends , though , perhaps , not so many as he deserves . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy , was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	A few weeks , he believed .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , ” said her mother , “ I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet ’s manor .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the coveys for you . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good - natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever ; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days ’ time .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , ” she added ; “ for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	” Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	she was of course carefully kept ; and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ’ beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and , in spite of everything , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His affection for her soon sunk into indifference : hers lasted a little longer ; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Though Darcy could never receive _ him _ at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ’s sake , he assisted him further in his profession .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long , that even Bingley ’s good - humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _ talk _ of giving them a hint to be gone .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ’s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropped all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Pemberley was now Georgiana ’s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive manner of talking to her brother .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But at length , by Elizabeth ’s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner ’s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- “ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy ’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style , and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins , in return for his last .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	/ * “ Dear Sir , * / “ I must trouble you once more for congratulations .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He has more to give .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Miss Bingley ’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother ’s in sending it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ’s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He bore it , however , with admirable calmness .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James ’s , with very decent composure .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Philips ’s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs. Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ’s good - humour encouraged ; yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I beg you will not put it into Lizzy ’s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	[ Illustration : “ Without once opening his lips ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Miss Bingley told me , ” said Jane , “ that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	With _ them _ he is remarkably agreeable . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , ” said Miss Lucas , “ but I wish he had danced with Eliza . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Another time , Lizzy , ” said her mother , “ I would not dance with _ him _ , if I were you . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I believe , ma’am , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ His pride , ” said Miss Lucas , “ does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ That is very true , ” replied Elizabeth , “ and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	” “ If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , ” cried a young Lucas , who came with his sisters , “ I should not care how proud I was .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Collins made his declaration in form .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	On finding Mrs. Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words,-- “ May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Collins must excuse me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And upon Elizabeth ’s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , “ Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Collins began,-- “ Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth ,
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to
Fitzwilliam Darcy	; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . ” The idea of Mr. Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued,-- “ My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh ’s footstool,--that she said , ‘ Mr. Collins , you must marry .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	A clergyman like you must marry .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake , and for your _ own _ ; let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ’
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters ,
Fitzwilliam Darcy	that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I
Fitzwilliam Darcy	flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother ’s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	” It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You are too hasty , sir , ” she cried .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You forget that I have made no answer .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Let me do it without further loss of time .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . ” “ I am not now to learn , ” replied Mr. Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , “ that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am , therefore , by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Upon my word , sir , ” cried Elizabeth , “ your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _ you _ so .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	” “ Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , ” said Mr. Collins , very gravely--“but I can not imagine that her Ladyship would at all disapprove of you .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Indeed , Mr. Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,-- “ When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Really , Mr. Collins , ” cried Elizabeth , with some warmth , “ you puzzle me exceedingly .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement
Fitzwilliam Darcy	, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration that , in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Your portion is unhappily so small , that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	As I must , therefore , conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ” “ You are uniformly charming ! ” cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; “ and I am persuaded that , when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . ” “ I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , ” he coldly replied .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree ; for in Darcy ’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and , with an expression of civil disdain , thus accosted her,-- “ So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy ’s steward .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ’s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ His guilt and his descent appear , by your account , to be the same , ” said Elizabeth , angrily
Fitzwilliam Darcy	; “ for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy ’s steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth instantly read her feelings ; and , at that moment , solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and everything else , gave way before the hope of Jane ’s being in the fairest way for happiness . “ I want to know , ” said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ’s , “ what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ No , ” replied Jane , “ I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy ’s regard . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself . ” “ No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But what does he say of the living ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _ conditionally _ only .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have found out , ” said he , “ by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh , and of her mother , Lady Catherine .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ” “ You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ? ” “ Indeed I am .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr. Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus,-- “ My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You must , therefore , allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which lead me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ; ” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words “ apology , ” “ Hunsford , ” and “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder ; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr. Darcy ’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech ; and at the end of it
Fitzwilliam Darcy	he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way :
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have no reason , I assure you , ” said he , “ to be dissatisfied with my reception .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	” As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ’s two sisters .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ’s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ What is Mr. Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _ he _ may not like to hear . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She looked at Jane to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued , however , impenetrably grave .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ If I , ” said Mr. Collins , “ were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And with a bow to Mr. Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Many stared -- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed , in a half - whisper to Lady
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man
Fitzwilliam Darcy	To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough ; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was teased by Mr. Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side ; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He assured her that , as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend himself to her ; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . There was no arguing upon such a project .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good - naturedly engaged Mr. Collins ’s conversation to herself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy ’s further notice : though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham , and rejoiced in it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Darcy said nothing at all .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Bingley was all grateful pleasure ; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _ her _ , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield . [ Illustration : “ to assure you in the most animated language ” ]
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy ’s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia ’s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He heard her attentively , and then said,-- “ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured , at any time , by their renewal . On the very last day of the regiment ’s remaining in Meryton , he dined , with others of the officers , at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good - humour , that , on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s and Mr. Darcy ’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Yes , very different ; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . ” “ Indeed ! ” cried Wickham , with a look which did not escape her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ And pray may I ask-- ” but checking himself , he added , in a gayer tone , “ Is it in address that he improves ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	for I dare not hope , ” he continued , in a lower and more serious tone , “ that he is improved in essentials . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added,-- “ When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	” Wickham ’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents,-- “ You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	More than once did Elizabeth , in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and , to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him , at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance ; for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins ’s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings , and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _ there _ too .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His words seemed to imply it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She supposed , if he meant anything , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was engaged one day , as she walked , in re - perusing Jane ’s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy , she saw , on looking up , that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Putting away the letter immediately , and forcing a smile , she said,-- “ I did not know before that you ever walked this way . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have been making the tour of the park , ” he replied , “ as I generally do every year , and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But I am at his disposal .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He arranges the business just as he pleases . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ He likes to have his own way very well , ” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I speak feelingly .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ In my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ These are home questions -- and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Our habits of expense make us too dependent , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said,-- “ I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present ; and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ No , ” said Colonel Fitzwilliam , “ that is an advantage which he must divide with me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . ” “ Are you , indeed ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ” As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly ; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You need not be frightened .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I think I have heard you say that you know them . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Their brother is a pleasant , gentlemanlike man -- he is a great friend of Darcy ’s . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Oh yes , ” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Care of him !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Yes , I really believe Darcy _ does _ take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ’s family it would be an unpleasant thing . ” “ You may depend upon my not mentioning it . ” “ And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars ; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ” “ And what arts did he use to separate them ? ” “ He did not talk to me of his own arts , ” said Fitzwilliam , smiling .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ He only told me what I have now told you . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I am thinking of what you have been telling me , ” said she .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Your cousin ’s conduct does not suit my feelings .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Why was he to be the judge ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ’s inclination ; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But , ” she continued , recollecting herself , “ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ That is not an unnatural surmise , ” said Fitzwilliam ; “ but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ’s triumph very sadly
Fitzwilliam Darcy	This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the Parsonage .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	There could not exist in the world _ two _ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _ he _ was the cause -- his pride and caprice were the cause -- of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ There were some very strong objections against the lady , ” were Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s words ; and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	When she thought of her mother , indeed , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections _ there _ had material weight with Mr. Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ’s connections than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ’s being rather displeased by her staying at home .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room , where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley ’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation ; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was “ very glad ; ” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley ’s salutation .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was full of joy and attention .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed , at his desire , to the other side of the fireplace , that she might be farther from the door .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to anyone else .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table -- but in vain .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards , and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Hurst had , therefore , nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Darcy took up a book .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs. Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ’s conversation with Miss Bennet .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Miss Bingley ’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy ’s progress through _ his _ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question and read on .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , “ How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when , hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said,-- “ By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ If you mean Darcy , ” cried her brother , “ he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	succeeded no less in the real object of her civility : Mr. Darcy looked up .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	What could he mean ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Not at all , ” was her answer ; “ but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything , and persevered , therefore , in requiring an explanation of his two motives .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , ” said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ’s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	How shall we punish him for such a speech ? ” “ Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , ” said Elizabeth .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Tease him -- laugh at him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	No , no ; I feel he may defy us there .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy may hug himself . ” “ Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! ” cried Elizabeth .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Miss Bingley , ” said he , “ has given me credit for more than can be .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , ” said Miss Bingley ; “ and pray what is the result ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He owns it himself without disguise . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ No , ” said Darcy , “ I have made no such pretension .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My temper I dare not vouch for .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It is , I believe , too little yielding ; certainly too little for the convenience of the world .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My temper would perhaps be called resentful .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ And yours , ” he replied , with a smile , “ is wilfully to misunderstand them . ” “ Do let us have a little music , ” cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened ; and Darcy , after a few moments ’ recollection , was not sorry for it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Miss Bingley saw , or suspected , enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I hope , ” said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , “ you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , to cure the younger girls of running after the officers .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ” [ Illustration : “ No , no ; stay where you are ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _
Fitzwilliam Darcy	] “ Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? ” “ Oh yes .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Put them next to your great - uncle the judge .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	As for your Elizabeth ’s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness , and immediately said,-- “ This walk is not wide enough for our party .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Indeed I have , sir , ” was her answer .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ The country , ” said Darcy , “ can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Yes , indeed , ” cried Mrs. Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Everybody was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph,-- “ I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But that gentleman , ” looking at Darcy , “ seemed to think the country was nothing at all . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You quite mistook Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love , ” said Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Oh yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well ; and by that time , most likely , Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _ her _ , in spite of all Miss Bingley ’s witticisms on _ fine eyes _ .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr. Darcy ’s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park : he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She had turned away ; but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	, I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ’s accidental information , that Bingley ’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	From that moment I observed my friend ’s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard ; and I remained convinced , from the evening ’s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The vicious propensities , the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr. Darcy could not have .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In town , I believe , he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence ; and being
Fitzwilliam Darcy	now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father ’s intentions .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	How he lived , I know not .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth coloured , and said , “ A little . ” “ And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma’am ? ” “ Yes , very handsome . ” “ I am sure _ I _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? ” said Mr. Gardiner .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She plays and sings all day long .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master : she comes here to - morrow with him . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks : Mrs. Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . “ Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Not so much as I could wish , sir : but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Except , ” thought Elizabeth , “ when she goes to Ramsgate . ” “ If your master would marry , you might see more of him . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Can this be Mr. Darcy ? ” thought she .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ His father was an excellent man , ” said Mrs. Gardiner .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ’s delight , when she should enter the room .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	is nothing he would not do for her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In the former were many good paintings : but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy ’s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	At last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ’s lifetime .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ’s happiness were in his guardianship !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She had instinctively turned away ; but stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy , the gardener ’s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	How strange must it appear to him !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination ; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived ,
Fitzwilliam Darcy	that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And his behaviour , so strikingly altered,--what could it mean ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	That he should even speak to her
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park , when he put his letter into her hand !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr. Darcy then was .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _ that _ in his voice , which was not like ease .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ’s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words “ delightful , ” and “ charming , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ What will be his surprise , ” thought she , “ when he knows who they are !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He takes them now for people of fashion . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	That he was _ surprised _ by the connection was evident : he sustained it , however , with fortitude : and , so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The conversation soon turned upon fishing ; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected--“for your housekeeper , ” she added , “ informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and , indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ They will join me early to - morrow , ” he continued , “ and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr . Bingley and his sisters . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley ’s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _ his _ mind was not very differently engaged .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ There is also one other person in the party , ” he continued after a pause , “ who more particularly wishes to be known to you .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They soon outstripped the others ; and when they had reached the carriage , Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner ’s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage ; and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned : but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of anything else .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr. Darcy ’s civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Jane listened with astonishment and concern : she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Bingley ’s regard
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father ’s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley ’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Besides , there was truth in his looks .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . ” But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley , if he _ had been _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy ’s look and behaviour .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth ’s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley ’s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ’s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke , either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , ” said he , “ that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ; a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Wickham ’s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer , and Mr. Collins ’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _ her _ .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Collins might never make the offer , and , till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Indeed ! ” “ Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I can not do justice to his kindness .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	How could his will be disregarded ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I have a warm unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _ of _ him , and _ to _ him , too freely .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He deserves to be publicly disgraced .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	” “ Some time or other he _ will _ be -- but it shall not be by _ me _ .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose _ him _ . ” Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ But what , ” said she , after a pause , “ can have been his motive ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him -- I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	After a few minutes ’ reflection , however , she continued , “ I _ do _ remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His disposition must be dreadful . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I will not trust myself on the subject , ” replied Wickham ; “ _ I _ can hardly be just to him . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , “ To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But she contented herself with--“And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	_ My _ father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Philips , appears to do so much credit to ; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ’s active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father ’s death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ as of affection to myself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . ” “ It _ is _ wonderful , ” replied Wickham ; “ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ? ” “ Yes ; it has often led him to be liberal and generous ; to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Family pride , and _ filial _ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He has also _ brotherly _ pride , which , with _ some _ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy ; but she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying,-- “ I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Do you know Mr. Bingley ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ He is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He can not know what Mr. Darcy is . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Probably not ; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He does not want abilities .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a
Fitzwilliam Darcy	different man from what he is to the less prosperous
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and , perhaps , agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her , with much earnest gravity , that it was not of the least importance ; that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I know very well , madam , ” said he , “ that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ” Mr. Wickham ’s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self - destined to another .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Mr. Collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ” “ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied Wickham ; “ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and Mr. Collins , in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river ; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ’s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr. Darcy
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Miss Darcy , on her brother ’s entrance
Fitzwilliam Darcy	, exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In Darcy ’s presence she dared not mention Wickham ’s name : but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ’s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	While she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ’s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	To no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ’s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He had certainly formed such a plan ; and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth ’s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair ; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth ’s person , behaviour , and dress .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her brother ’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour : his judgment could not err ; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , ” she cried : “ I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was resolutely silent , however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued,-- “ I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ‘ _ She _ a beauty !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Yes , ” replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , “ but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of everything but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ’s beginning the subject .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of ;
Fitzwilliam Darcy	it was evident that he was very much in love with her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They could not be untouched by his politeness ; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant ’s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant , who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well - known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She certainly did not hate him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	No ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities
Fitzwilliam Darcy	, though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It was gratitude;--gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance ; and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his
Fitzwilliam Darcy	and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely -- more , I think , than last year .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I told Mrs. Collins so before you came .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You must contrive to send somebody .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs. Collins .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Where shall you change horses ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours : whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . Mr. Darcy ’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation : but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect : but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Anxiety on Jane ’s behalf was another prevailing concern ; and Mr. Darcy ’s explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr. Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr. Darcy they had
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her Ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? ” Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ’s proficiency .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ’s ill - breeding , and made no answer .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ’s countenance .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile , and said,-- “ You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , “ Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy ,
Fitzwilliam Darcy	you can not deny the fact .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	” “ I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Perhaps , ” said Darcy , “ I should have judged better had I sought an introduction , but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ” said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill - qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I can answer your question , ” said Fitzwilliam , “ without applying to him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It is because he will not give himself the trouble . ” “ I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , ” said Darcy , “ of conversing easily with those I have never seen before .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Darcy smiled and said , “ You are perfectly right .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy,-- “ Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth looked at Darcy , to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ’s praise : but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and
Fitzwilliam Darcy	from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh
Fitzwilliam Darcy	she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _ her _ , had she been his relation .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Tell him what a dreadful state I am in -- that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lady Catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of Bingley , and _ her _ being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	From what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _ she _ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one _ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In that case he would return no more .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , ” she added , “ I shall know how to understand it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . ” The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great : but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet ’s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject . The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The colour now rushed into Elizabeth ’s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself , when her father continued,-- “ You look conscious .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	This letter is from Mr. Collins . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ From Mr. Collins !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	and what can _ he _ have to say ? ” “ Something very much to the purpose , of course .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	, it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it ; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ’
Fitzwilliam Darcy	‘ This young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ’s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ’
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	‘ My motive for cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ’
Fitzwilliam Darcy	_ Mr. Darcy _ , you see , is the man !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _ you _ in his life !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ ‘ After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ’
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Collins , moreover , adds , ‘ I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ’s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	_ That _ is his notion of Christian forgiveness !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ’s situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You are not going to be _ missish _ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference and _ your _ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins ’s correspondence for any consideration .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Nay , when I read a letter of his , I can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of Mr. Darcy ’s indifference ; and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that , perhaps , instead of his seeing too _ little _ , she might have fancied too _ much _ .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	While in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends -- to his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? ” “ Yes ; and I had heard it before .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ But the wife of Mr. Darcy
Fitzwilliam Darcy	My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ’s daughter ; so far we are equal . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Whatever my connections may be , ” said Elizabeth , “ if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? ” Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment ’s deliberation,-- “ I am not . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I know it all ; that the young man ’s marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expense of your father and uncle .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And is _ such _ a girl to be my nephew ’s sister ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Is _ her _ husband , who is the son of his late father ’s steward , to be his brother ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You are then resolved to have him ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ’s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His brother - in - law , Mr. Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien , and the report , which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and
Fitzwilliam Darcy	being unworthy to be compared with his friend .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	What a contrast between him and his friend !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	His character was decided .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and everybody hoped that he would never come there again .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Come , Darcy , ” said he , “ I must have you dance .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You had much better dance . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I certainly shall not .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I would not be so fastidious as you are , ” cried Bingley , “ for a kingdom !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ _ You _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , ” said Mr. Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Oh , she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	_ ] ] “ Which do you mean ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till , catching her eye , he withdrew his own , and coldly said , “ She is tolerable : but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Bingley followed his advice .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth
Fitzwilliam Darcy	remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit , and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ But I can assure you , ” she added , “ that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	So high and so conceited , that there was no enduring him !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I quite detest the man . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy ’s sister , as , by Wickham ’s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known : she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _ dislike _ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Engaged to Mr. Darcy !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He still loves me , and we are engaged . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I know how much you dislike him . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And do you really love him quite well enough ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ What do you mean ? ” “ Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began ; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I always had a value for him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ’s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Good gracious ! ” cried Mrs. Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , “ if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	What shall we do with him ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ’s way . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , “ Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . ” “ It may do very well for the others , ” replied Mr. Bingley ; “ but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	As she went upstairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying,-- “ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It is all for Jane ’s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ” During their walk , it was resolved that Mr. Bennet ’s consent should be asked in the course of the evening : Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ’s .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man ; but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In the evening , soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	She did not fear her father ’s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means ; that _ she _ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , “ Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Are you out of your senses to be accepting this man ?
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Have not you always hated him ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr. Darcy
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Or , in other words , you are determined to have him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But will they make you happy ? ” “ Have you any other objection , ” said Elizabeth , “ than your belief of my indifference ? ” “ None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ” “ I do , I do like him , ” she replied , with tears in her eyes ; “ I love him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Indeed he has no improper pride .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He is perfectly amiable .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Lizzy , ” said her father , “ I have given him my consent .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and , at length , by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ’ suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ’s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	If this be the case , he deserves you .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He heard her with astonishment .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	And so , Darcy did everything ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ’s debts , and got him his commission !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Had it been your uncle ’s doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading Mr. Collins ’s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go , saying , as she quitted the room , “ If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	Mr. Darcy !
Fitzwilliam Darcy	pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	I hope he will overlook it .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But , my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . ” This was a sad omen of what her mother ’s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ’ consent , there was still something to be wished for .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , ” said he .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane ’s . ”
Mary Bennet	“ I admire the activity of your benevolence , ” observed Mary , “ but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . ”
Mary Bennet	After tea , Mr. Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went upstairs to her instrument .
Mary Bennet	Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .
Mary Bennet	“ Pride , ” observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , “ is a very common failing , I believe .
Mary Bennet	By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .
Mary Bennet	But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
Mary Bennet	did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Mary Bennet	Elizabeth ’s eyes were fixed on her , with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
Mary Bennet	Mary ’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display
Mary Bennet	; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .
Mary Bennet	She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .
Mary Bennet	He took the hint , and , when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud,-- “ That will do extremely well , child .
Mary Bennet	You have delighted us long enough .
Mary Bennet	Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her father ’s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Mary Bennet	To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough ; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Mary Bennet	“ In point of composition , ” said Mary , “ his letter does not seem defective .
Mary Bennet	The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed .
Mary Bennet	Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ’s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . “ Oh , Mary , ” said she , “ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .
Mary Bennet	She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all .
Mary Bennet	Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well .
Mary Bennet	As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table,-- “ This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of .
Mary Bennet	But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . ” Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , “ Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . ” Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .
Mary Bennet	Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .
Mary Bennet	He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt : but I hope this may be false . ” “ Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! ” “ Perhaps it would have been better , ” replied her sister .
Mary Bennet	you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . ” “ Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .
Mary Bennet	Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .
Mary Bennet	He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading Mr. Collins ’s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go , saying , as she quitted the room , “ If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . ”
Mrs. Bennet	After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr. Bennet coolly observed,--
Mrs. Bennet	“ From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .
Mrs. Bennet	I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . “ I am astonished , my dear , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .
Mrs. Bennet	If I wished to think slightingly of anybody ’s children , it should not be of my own , however . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . ” “ Yes ; but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .
Mrs. Bennet	I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .
Mrs. Bennet	When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .
Mrs. Bennet	I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ’s in his regimentals . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Mamma , ” cried Lydia , “ my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson ’s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke ’s library . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet ’s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read,-- “ Well , Jane , who is it from ?
Mrs. Bennet	Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives ; for a whole day ’s _ tête - à - tête _ between two women can never end without a quarrel .
Mrs. Bennet	My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .
Mrs. Bennet	“ With the officers ! ” cried Lydia : “ I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . ” “ Dining out , ” said Mrs. Bennet ; “ that is very unlucky . ” “ Can I have the carriage ? ” said Jane .
Mrs. Bennet	“ No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ That would be a good scheme , ” said Elizabeth , “ if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure .
Mrs. Bennet	“ They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ But if you have got them to - day , ” said Elizabeth , “ my mother ’s purpose will be answered .
Mrs. Bennet	Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .
Mrs. Bennet	“ This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! ” said Mrs. Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .
Mrs. Bennet	, however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .
Mrs. Bennet	They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me .
Mrs. Bennet	“ Well , my dear , ” said Mr. Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , “ if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , ” said her father , “ to send for the horses ? ” “ No , indeed .
Mrs. Bennet	“ If we make haste , ” said Lydia , as they walked along , “ perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter , before he goes . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .
Mrs. Bennet	With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley , and talked of Mrs. Darcy , may be guessed .
Mrs. Bennet	I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though , perhaps , it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
Mrs. Bennet	Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet ’s being quite unable to sit alone .
Mrs. Bennet	Mr. Darcy ’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style , and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins , in return for his last .
Mrs. Bennet	On finding Mrs. Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words,-- “ May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise , Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,--
Mrs. Bennet	I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection .
Mrs. Bennet	Come , Kitty , I want you upstairs . ”
Mrs. Bennet	And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out,-- “ Dear ma’am , do not go .
Mrs. Bennet	I beg you will not go .
Mrs. Bennet	I desire you will stay where you are . ”
Mrs. Bennet	And upon Elizabeth ’s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , “ Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Collins began,-- “ Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth ,
Mrs. Bennet	your respected mother ’s permission for this address
Mrs. Bennet	To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother ’s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .
Mrs. Bennet	“ Really , Mr. Collins , ” cried Elizabeth , with some warmth , “ you puzzle me exceedingly .
Mrs. Bennet	I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh , and of her mother , Lady Catherine .
Mrs. Bennet	Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr. Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Mrs. Bennet	Her mother ’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
Mrs. Bennet	When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley .
Mrs. Bennet	It was an animating subject , and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
Mrs. Bennet	It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and , lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
Mrs. Bennet	It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .
Mrs. Bennet	In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ’s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Mrs. Bennet	Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
Mrs. Bennet	“ What is Mr. Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?
Mrs. Bennet	I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _ he _ may not like to hear . ”
Mrs. Bennet	What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy ?
Mrs. Bennet	You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .
Mrs. Bennet	She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
Mrs. Bennet	At length , however , Mrs. Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .
Mrs. Bennet	Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Mrs. Bennet	Bingley was all grateful pleasure ; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months .
Mrs. Bennet	Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
Mrs. Bennet	Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _ her _ , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield . [ Illustration : “ to assure you in the most animated language ” ]
Mrs. Bennet	In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls
Mrs. Bennet	Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .
Mrs. Bennet	She would not listen , therefore , to her daughter ’s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .
Mrs. Bennet	After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ’s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .
Mrs. Bennet	Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .
Mrs. Bennet	“ You may depend upon it , madam , ” said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , “ that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .
Mrs. Bennet	“ I am sure , ” she added , “ if it was not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception ,
Mrs. Bennet	the sweetest temper I ever met with
Mrs. Bennet	I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _ her _ .
Mrs. Bennet	I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .
Mrs. Bennet	You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Lizzy , ” cried her mother , “ remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . ” “ I did not know before , ” continued Bingley , immediately , “ that you were a studier of character .
Mrs. Bennet	“ Yes , indeed , ” cried Mrs. Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .
Mrs. Bennet	“ I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Everybody was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph,-- “ I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places .
Mrs. Bennet	“ Indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , ” said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother .
Mrs. Bennet	“ You quite mistook Mr. Darcy .
Mrs. Bennet	He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .
Mrs. Bennet	I know we dine with four - and - twenty families . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ’s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _ her _ coming away .
Mrs. Bennet	_ That _ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths
Mrs. Bennet	I fancy she was wanted about the mince - pies .
Mrs. Bennet	For my part , Mr. Bingley , _ I _ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _ my _ daughters are brought up differently .
Mrs. Bennet	But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you .
Mrs. Bennet	Not that _ I _ think Charlotte so _ very _ plain ; but then she is our particular friend .
Mrs. Bennet	Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ’s beauty .
Mrs. Bennet	I do not like to boast of my own child ; but to be sure , Jane -- one does not often see anybody better looking .
Mrs. Bennet	I do not trust my own partiality .
Mrs. Bennet	When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ’s in town so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .
Mrs. Bennet	Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .
Mrs. Bennet	She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .
Mrs. Bennet	She performed her part , indeed , without much graciousness , but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .
Mrs. Bennet	Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters
Mrs. Bennet	Lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .
Mrs. Bennet	His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother ’s ear .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _ her _ , in spite of all Miss Bingley ’s witticisms on _ fine eyes _ .
Mrs. Bennet	To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .
Mrs. Bennet	They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet ’s civilities .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
Mrs. Bennet	A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his right as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility .
Mrs. Bennet	The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ’s _ tête - à - tête _ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on .
Mrs. Bennet	“ As to her _ younger _ daughters , she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _ know _ of any prepossession;--her _ eldest _ daughter she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .
Mrs. Bennet	Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire .
Mrs. Bennet	Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .
Mrs. Bennet	She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologizing for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself , however , might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .
Mrs. Bennet	Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips ’s manners and politeness .
Mrs. Bennet	He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia ’s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr. Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill - will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .
Mrs. Bennet	XIII “ I hope , my dear , ” said Mr. Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , “ that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Who do you mean , my dear ?
Mrs. Bennet	I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in ; and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her .
Mrs. Bennet	I do not believe she often sees such at home . ” “ The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger . ” Mrs. Bennet ’s eyes sparkled .
Mrs. Bennet	It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure .
Mrs. Bennet	Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley .
Mrs. Bennet	Lydia , my love , ring the bell .
Mrs. Bennet	I must speak to Hill this moment .
Mrs. Bennet	” “ It is _ not _ Mr. Bingley , ” said her husband ; “ it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . ” This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .
Mrs. Bennet	After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it ; for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .
Mrs. Bennet	It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Oh , my dear , ” cried his wife , “ I can not bear to hear that mentioned .
Mrs. Bennet	I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure , if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .
Mrs. Bennet	They had often attempted it before : but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .
Mrs. Bennet	“ It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ” “ No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .
Mrs. Bennet	I hate such false friends .
Mrs. Bennet	/ “ Dear Sir , “ The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness ; and , since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach :
Mrs. Bennet	but , for some time , I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance . ”--‘There , Mrs. Bennet . ’--“My mind , however , is now made up on the subject ; for , having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .
Mrs. Bennet	I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ; but of this hereafter .
Mrs. Bennet	If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o’clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .
Mrs. Bennet	I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , “ WILLIAM COLLINS . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ At four o’clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , ” said Mr. Bennet , as he folded up the letter .
Mrs. Bennet	“ He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and , I doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however ; and , if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . ”
Mrs. Bennet	Can he be a sensible man , sir ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ No , my dear ; I think not .
Mrs. Bennet	I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .
Mrs. Bennet	I am impatient to see him . ”
Mrs. Bennet	As for their mother , Mr. Collins ’s letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters .
Mrs. Bennet	Mr. Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .
Mrs. Bennet	He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .
Mrs. Bennet	This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily,-- “ You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .
Mrs. Bennet	“ You allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Ah , sir , I do indeed .
Mrs. Bennet	It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .
Mrs. Bennet	Not that I mean to find fault with _ you _ , for such things , I know , are all chance in this world .
Mrs. Bennet	“ I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .
Mrs. Bennet	But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .
Mrs. Bennet	The hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture , were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet ’s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .
Mrs. Bennet	But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet , who assured him , with some asperity , that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .
Mrs. Bennet	He begged pardon for having displeased her .
Mrs. Bennet	In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes ’ conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill - usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill - judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .
Mrs. Bennet	“ If I had been able , ” said she , “ to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .
Mrs. Bennet	I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .
Mrs. Bennet	I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am .
Mrs. Bennet	As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . ” “ Oh , my dear brother , ” replied Mrs. Bennet , “ that is exactly what I could most wish for .
Mrs. Bennet	After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject by saying , “ But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard .
Mrs. Bennet	But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties .
Mrs. Bennet	Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters .
Mrs. Bennet	On the following Monday , Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came , as usual , to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .
Mrs. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet ’s best comfort was , that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer .
Mrs. Bennet	“ Good gracious ! ” cried Mrs. Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , “ if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !
Mrs. Bennet	I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
Mrs. Bennet	Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , “ Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .
Mrs. Bennet	As she went upstairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying,-- “ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it .
Mrs. Bennet	It is all for Jane ’s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ” During their walk , it was resolved that Mr. Bennet ’s consent should be asked in the course of the evening : Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ’s .
Mrs. Bennet	She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man ; but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
Mrs. Bennet	When her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
Mrs. Bennet	But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .
Mrs. Bennet	“ My dearest child , ” she cried , “ I can think of nothing else .
Mrs. Bennet	But , my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . ” This was a sad omen of what her mother ’s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ’ consent , there was still something to be wished for .
Mrs. Bennet	But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
Mrs. Phillips	The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt , and to a milliner ’s shop just over the way .
Mrs. Phillips	: their minds were more vacant than their sisters ’ , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and , however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .
Mrs. Phillips	Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .
Mrs. Phillips	“ Mamma , ” cried Lydia , “ my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson ’s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke ’s library . ”
Mrs. Phillips	“ With the officers ! ” cried Lydia : “ I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . ” “ Dining out , ” said Mrs. Bennet ; “ that is very unlucky . ” “ Can I have the carriage ? ” said Jane .
Mrs. Phillips	The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips .
Mrs. Phillips	It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her , with much earnest gravity , that it was not of the least importance ; that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .
Mrs. Phillips	“ I know very well , madam , ” said he , “ that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .
Mrs. Phillips	” Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham ’s attentions . There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips ’s supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody . Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .
Mrs. Phillips	Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and Mr. Collins , in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .
Mr. Phillips	Mr. Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .
Mr. Hurst	Mr. Darcy said very little , and Mr. Hurst nothing at all .
Mr. Hurst	The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .
Mr. Hurst	But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you .
George Wickham	Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .
George Wickham	The day of his and Lydia ’s departure soon came ; and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .
George Wickham	“ Write to me very often , my dear . ” “ As often as I can .
George Wickham	My sisters may write to _ me _ .
George Wickham	Mr. Wickham ’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ’s .
George Wickham	He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .
George Wickham	It was only said , ‘ Lately , George Wickham , Esq . , to Miss Lydia Bennet , ’ without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything .
George Wickham	“ You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , ” she added ; “ for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned .
George Wickham	I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .
George Wickham	Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time .
George Wickham	Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so .
George Wickham	In his present behaviour to herself
George Wickham	, moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure ; for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .
George Wickham	She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured , at any time , by their renewal . On the very last day of the regiment ’s remaining in Meryton , he dined , with others of the officers , at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good - humour , that , on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s and Mr. Darcy ’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .
George Wickham	He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but , with a moment ’s recollection , and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him .
George Wickham	Her answer was warmly in his favour .
George Wickham	With an air of indifference , he soon afterwards added , “ How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? ” “ Nearly three weeks . ” “ And you saw him frequently ? ” “ Yes , almost every day . ” “ His manners are very different from his cousin ’s . ”
George Wickham	“ Yes , very different ; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . ” “ Indeed ! ” cried Wickham , with a look which did not escape her .
George Wickham	“ And pray may I ask-- ” but checking himself , he added , in a gayer tone , “ Is it in address that he improves ?
George Wickham	for I dare not hope , ” he continued , in a lower and more serious tone , “ that he is improved in essentials . ”
George Wickham	While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning .
George Wickham	There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added,-- “ When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .
George Wickham	” Wickham ’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents,-- “ You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right .
George Wickham	His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by .
George Wickham	I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .
George Wickham	His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart .
George Wickham	She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .
George Wickham	The rest of the evening passed with the _ appearance _ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .
George Wickham	The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham .
George Wickham	, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .
George Wickham	Of what he has _ particularly _ accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
George Wickham	Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ’s education .
George Wickham	My father was not only fond of this young man ’s society , whose manners were always engaging , he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
George Wickham	As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .
George Wickham	The vicious propensities , the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr. Darcy could not have .
George Wickham	But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .
George Wickham	My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant .
George Wickham	I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman .
George Wickham	About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr. Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained
George Wickham	a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child ,
George Wickham	Regard for my sister ’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge .
George Wickham	Mr. Wickham ’s chief object was unquestionably my sister ’s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement .
George Wickham	His revenge would have been complete indeed .
George Wickham	This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham .
George Wickham	I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood , he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at , ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either .
George Wickham	She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantel - piece . Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .
George Wickham	The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ’s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expense .
George Wickham	This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham ’s being among them .
George Wickham	“ To be sure , Lizzy , ” said her aunt , “ he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ’s countenance , for his features are perfectly good .
George Wickham	“ From what we have seen of him , ” continued Mrs. Gardiner , “ I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham .
George Wickham	Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and , therefore , gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ’s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .
George Wickham	Elizabeth related to Jane , the next day , what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself .
George Wickham	yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .
George Wickham	The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake
George Wickham	“ Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .
George Wickham	My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father ’s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible .
George Wickham	“ I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley ’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony .
George Wickham	The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery , where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .
George Wickham	Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy ’s look and behaviour .
George Wickham	The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person ; for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham
George Wickham	, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball .
George Wickham	She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed .
George Wickham	Mr. Wickham ’s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer , and Mr. Collins ’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
George Wickham	Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia .
George Wickham	His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .
George Wickham	Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter , especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .
George Wickham	“ It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , ” he added , “ which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire .
George Wickham	I know it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps ; and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .
George Wickham	Society , I own , is necessary to me .
George Wickham	I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .
George Wickham	I _ must _ have employment and society .
George Wickham	A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .
George Wickham	The church _ ought _ to have been my profession -- I was brought up for the church ; and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . ”
George Wickham	“ Indeed ! ” “ Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .
George Wickham	He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .
George Wickham	I can not do justice to his kindness .
George Wickham	He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .
George Wickham	Why did not you seek legal redress ? ” “ There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .
George Wickham	A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing .
George Wickham	Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it .
George Wickham	I have a warm unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _ of _ him , and _ to _ him , too freely .
George Wickham	I can recall nothing worse .
George Wickham	But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .
George Wickham	” “ Some time or other he _ will _ be -- but it shall not be by _ me _ .
George Wickham	Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose _ him _ . ” Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .
George Wickham	“ A thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which I can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy .
George Wickham	Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life .
George Wickham	He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me . ”
George Wickham	“ I will not trust myself on the subject , ” replied Wickham ; “ _ I _ can hardly be just to him . ”
George Wickham	She could have added , “ A young man , too , like _ you _ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable . ”
George Wickham	But she contented herself with--“And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner .
George Wickham	Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ’s active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father ’s death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ as of affection to myself .
George Wickham	I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you .
George Wickham	If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . ” “ It _ is _ wonderful , ” replied Wickham ; “ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend .
George Wickham	But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . ”
George Wickham	He shook his head .
George Wickham	“ I wish I could call her amiable .
George Wickham	It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy ; but she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud .
George Wickham	As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .
George Wickham	But she is nothing to me now .
George Wickham	She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . Since her father ’s death her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . ”
George Wickham	Do you know Mr. Bingley ? ”
George Wickham	There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ” Mr. Wickham ’s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living .
George Wickham	“ Mr. Collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ” “ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied Wickham ; “ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
George Wickham	She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .
George Wickham	” Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham ’s attentions . There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips ’s supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody . Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .
George Wickham	Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .
George Wickham	She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham , and of what he had told her ,
George Wickham	[ Illustration : “ delighted to see their dear friend again ” ]
George Wickham	In Darcy ’s presence she dared not mention Wickham ’s name : but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ’s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
George Wickham	Elizabeth ’s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
George Wickham	With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well - known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged .
George Wickham	His attachment to Rosings certainly increases . ”
George Wickham	When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham ’s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .
George Wickham	This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .
George Wickham	His appearance was greatly in his favour : he had all the best parts of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .
George Wickham	The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street . On distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .
George Wickham	Mr. Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return .
George Wickham	In another minute Mr. Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .
George Wickham	Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips ’s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ’s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs. Philips ’s throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .
George Wickham	She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “ stupid , disagreeable fellows .
George Wickham	the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .
George Wickham	Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ?
George Wickham	There is no danger of Wickham ’s marrying Mary King -- there ’s for you !
George Wickham	Wickham is safe . ”
George Wickham	“ She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . ”
George Wickham	“ I am sure there is not on _ his _ .
George Wickham	I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her .
George Wickham	When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .
George Wickham	Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham ’s name .
George Wickham	She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .
George Wickham	“ I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , ” said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; “ and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .
George Wickham	It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his Colonel ’s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .
George Wickham	“ Do you really think so ? ” cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .
George Wickham	“ Upon my word , ” said Mrs. Gardiner , “ I begin to be of your uncle ’s opinion .
George Wickham	It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .
George Wickham	I can not think so very ill of Wickham .
George Wickham	Can you , yourself , Lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ” “ Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .
George Wickham	But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .
George Wickham	“ In the first place , ” replied Mr. Gardiner , “ there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . ”
George Wickham	His most particular friend , you see by Jane ’s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .
George Wickham	Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .
George Wickham	He can not afford it .
George Wickham	And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?
George Wickham	Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ’s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ”
George Wickham	“ But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? ” “ It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , ” replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , “ that a sister ’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .
George Wickham	And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman .
George Wickham	” “ But you see that Jane , ” said her aunt , “ does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . ”
George Wickham	But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .
George Wickham	We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating .
George Wickham	From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .
George Wickham	He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . ”
George Wickham	Her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children ,
George Wickham	Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .
George Wickham	Mrs. Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes ’ conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill - usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill - judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .
George Wickham	And now here ’s Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?
George Wickham	The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . “ Do not give way to useless alarm , ” added he : “ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .
George Wickham	As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . ” “ Oh , my dear brother , ” replied Mrs. Bennet , “ that is exactly what I could most wish for .
George Wickham	And , above all things , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting .
George Wickham	I know you will contrive it all . ” But Mr. Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters .
George Wickham	He _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . ” “ And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?
George Wickham	I felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister ’s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .
George Wickham	“ And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ?
George Wickham	Does he know his real character ? ”
George Wickham	“ I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .
George Wickham	He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt : but I hope this may be false . ” “ Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! ” “ Perhaps it would have been better , ” replied her sister .
George Wickham	When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one ; and
George Wickham	on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth ’s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .
George Wickham	To Mrs. Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .
George Wickham	About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged .
George Wickham	They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ’s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring . Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well .
George Wickham	In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor
George Wickham	, she was delighting both him and herself .
George Wickham	Let Wickham be your man .
George Wickham	He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ” “ Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .
George Wickham	Mr. Wickham ’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .
George Wickham	They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .
George Wickham	The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr. Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy
George Wickham	You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham ’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .
George Wickham	The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .
George Wickham	“ Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , ” said her sister .
George Wickham	“ Wickham ’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds : I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . ”
George Wickham	Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced .
George Wickham	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ” said Elizabeth , “ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .
George Wickham	How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too !
George Wickham	We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . ”
George Wickham	Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness .
George Wickham	Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself ; but his manners were always so pleasing , that , had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .
George Wickham	Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .
George Wickham	The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood ,
George Wickham	Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .
George Wickham	Wickham ’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ’s for him .
George Wickham	She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .
George Wickham	He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .
George Wickham	He did everything best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September than anybody else in the country .
George Wickham	We were married , you know , at St. Clement ’s , because Wickham ’s lodgings were in that parish .
George Wickham	However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .
George Wickham	I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .
George Wickham	However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . ”
George Wickham	“ Mr. Darcy ! ” repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .
George Wickham	he was to come there with Wickham , you know .
George Wickham	What will Wickham say ?
George Wickham	“ Thank you , ” said Lydia ; “ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ” On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
George Wickham	Mr. Darcy had been at her sister ’s wedding .
George Wickham	It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
George Wickham	Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
George Wickham	Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins .
George Wickham	The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .
George Wickham	His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . Her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .
George Wickham	As they drove to Mr. Gardiner ’s door , Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival : when they entered the passage , she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .
George Wickham	Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ’s visit in Gracechurch Street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ’s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .
George Wickham	I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . ”
George Wickham	Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ” “ If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . ” “ She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .
George Wickham	“ But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather ’s death made her mistress of this fortune ? ”
George Wickham	“ No -- why should he ?
George Wickham	If it were not allowable for him to gain _ my _ affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? ”
George Wickham	“ But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . ” “ A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .
George Wickham	“ _ Her _ not objecting does not justify _ him _ .
George Wickham	_ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . ”
George Wickham	Mr. Darcy ’s sister , as , by Wickham ’s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away
Mr. Bennet	“ He is as fine a fellow , ” said Mr. Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , “ as ever I saw .
Mr. Bennet	I am prodigiously proud of him .
Mr. Bennet	I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son - in - law .
Mr. Bennet	Lydia ’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten : every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr. Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr. Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr. Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .
Mr. Bennet	Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly .
Mr. Bennet	In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there : his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .
Mr. Bennet	Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .
Mr. Bennet	Their reception from Mr. Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .
Mr. Bennet	His countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips .
Mr. Bennet	The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .
Mr. Bennet	Her father lifted up his eyes , Jane was distressed , Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued,-- “ Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ?
Mr. Bennet	“ I thank you for my share of the favour , ” said Elizabeth ; “ but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , ” said his lady to him one day , “ have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? ”
Mr. Bennet	Mr. Bennet replied that he had not . “ But it is , ” returned she ; “ for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . ”
Mr. Bennet	Mr. Bennet made no answer .
Mr. Bennet	“ Do not you want to know who has taken it ? ” cried his wife , impatiently .
Mr. Bennet	“ _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Oh , single , my dear , to be sure !
Mr. Bennet	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , ” replied his wife , “ how can you be so tiresome ?
Mr. Bennet	You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . ”
Mr. Bennet	Nonsense , how can you talk so !
Mr. Bennet	But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him
Mr. Bennet	“ I see no occasion for that .
Mr. Bennet	“ My dear , you flatter me .
Mr. Bennet	“ But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . ” “ It is more than I engage for , I assure you . ” “ But consider your daughters .
Mr. Bennet	Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account ; for in general , you know , they visit no new comers .
Mr. Bennet	Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him , if you do not . ”
Mr. Bennet	I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls -- though
Mr. Bennet	I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ I desire you will do no such thing .
Mr. Bennet	But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ They have none of them much to recommend them , ” replied he : “ they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . ” “ Mr. Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?
Mr. Bennet	You take delight in vexing me .
Mr. Bennet	You have no compassion on my poor nerves . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ You mistake me , my dear .
Mr. Bennet	I have a high respect for your nerves .
Mr. Bennet	They are my old friends .
Mr. Bennet	I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Ah , you do not know what I suffer . ” “ But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood .
Mr. Bennet	“ It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . ” Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three - and - twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .

Sir William Lucas	I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son - in - law .
Sir William Lucas	He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James ’s , with very decent composure .
Sir William Lucas	If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .
Sir William Lucas	Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy ’s steward .
Sir William Lucas	Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner .
Sir William Lucas	I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .
Sir William Lucas	I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ’s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ”
Sir William Lucas	I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . ”
Sir William Lucas	Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him .
Sir William Lucas	She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
Sir William Lucas	“ Yes , she called yesterday with her father .
Sir William Lucas	What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr. Bingley -- is not he ?
Sir William Lucas	He has always something to say to everybody .
Sir William Lucas	Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ? ” “ I am the less surprised at what has happened , ” replied Sir William , “ from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .
Sir William Lucas	When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ’s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ’s courage did not fail her .
Sir William Lucas	In spite of having been at St. James ’s , Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .
Sir William Lucas	He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son - in - law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .
Sir William Lucas	Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino
Sir William Lucas	Sir William did not say much .
Sir William Lucas	He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .
Sir William Lucas	From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach ; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins ’s side , and as many bows on Sir William ’s , they departed .
Sir William Lucas	She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .
Sir William Lucas	Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good - humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .
Sir William Lucas	Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ’s too long .
Sir William Lucas	He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out , like his information .
Sir William Lucas	Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	But at length , by Elizabeth ’s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner ’s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- “ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	You supposed more than really existed .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Your idea of the ponies
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Mr. Darcy ’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style , and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins , in return for his last .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Console Lady Catherine as well as you can .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ’s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Mrs. Philips ’s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs. Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ’s good - humour encouraged ; yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh ’s footstool,--that she said , ‘ Mr. Collins , you must marry .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh , and of her mother , Lady Catherine .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I believe him to be Lady Catherine ’s _ nephew _ .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words “ apology , ” “ Hunsford , ” and “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	” “ Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , ” said Mr. Collins , very gravely--“but I can not imagine that her Ladyship would at all disapprove of you .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Mr. Collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ” “ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied Wickham ; “ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her Ladyship ’s indignation would have been .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , ” said Lady Catherine ; “ I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me !
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely -- more , I think , than last year .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits ; and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added,-- “ But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation , ” replied Elizabeth ; “ but it is not in my power to accept it .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I expected you to stay two months .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I told Mrs. Collins so before you came .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . ” “ You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine seemed resigned .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I am excessively attentive to all those things .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey ; and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary -- which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her Ladyship ’s indignation would have been .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine ’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . “ I confess , ” said he , “ that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	” While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company ; and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James ’s .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	From the entrance hall , of which Mr. Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	She was not rendered formidable by silence : but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	, from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view , Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her Ladyship ’s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son - in - law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	When the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	She inquired into Charlotte ’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all ; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady ’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine then observed,--
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Your father ’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think ?
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	For your sake , ” turning to Charlotte , “ I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	But I suppose you had no opportunity .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I never heard of such a thing .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Ay , no doubt : but that is what a governess will prevent ; and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I am always glad to get a young person well placed out .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe ’s calling yesterday to thank me ?
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	‘ Lady Catherine , ’ said she , ‘ you have given me a treasure . ’
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Yes , ma’am , all . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	But really , ma’am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Upon my word , ” said her Ladyship , “ you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . ” “ I am not one - and - twenty . ” When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologizing if he thought he won too many .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broken up , the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	The invitation was accepted , of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ’s drawing - room .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Her Ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	_ His _ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her Ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out,-- “ What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Let me hear what it is .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ We were talking of music , madam , ” said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , ” said Lady Catherine ; “ and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I assure you , madam , ” he replied , “ that she does not need such advice .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	She would be in nobody ’s way , you know , in that part of the house . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ’s countenance .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy,-- “ Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ’s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	but , for some time , I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance . ”--‘There , Mrs. Bennet . ’--“My mind , however , is now made up on the subject ; for , having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o’clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , “ WILLIAM COLLINS . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and , I doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily,-- “ You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . ”
Kitty Bennet	Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .
Kitty Bennet	In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .
Kitty Bennet	She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia ; and , removed from the influence of Lydia ’s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .
Kitty Bennet	she was of course carefully kept ; and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .
Kitty Bennet	“ We will be down as soon as we can , ” said Jane ; “ but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago .
Kitty Bennet	“ Oh ! hang Kitty !
Kitty Bennet	what has she to do with it ?
Kitty Bennet	Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , “ What is the matter , mamma ?
Kitty Bennet	What do you keep winking at me for ?
Kitty Bennet	What am I to do ? ”
Kitty Bennet	She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty,-- “ Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , ” took her out of the room
Kitty Bennet	“ We may as well leave them by themselves , you know , ” said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . “ Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . ” Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room .
Kitty Bennet	She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card - party , and was sitting upstairs with Kitty .
Kitty Bennet	Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .
Kitty Bennet	Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .
Kitty Bennet	Come , Kitty , I want you upstairs . ”
Kitty Bennet	Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Collins began,-- “ Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth ,
Kitty Bennet	Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family .
Kitty Bennet	“ A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . ” “ And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good , ” added Kitty .
Kitty Bennet	The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs. Forster , the delight of Mrs. Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described .
Kitty Bennet	Wholly inattentive to her sister ’s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone ’s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . “ I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , ” said she , “ though I am _ not _ her particular friend .
Kitty Bennet	I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . ”
Kitty Bennet	In this danger Kitty is also comprehended .
Kitty Bennet	She will follow wherever Lydia leads .
Kitty Bennet	Kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .
Kitty Bennet	All were struck with the stranger ’s air , all wondered who he could be ; and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement , when the two gentlemen , turning back , had reached the same spot .
Kitty Bennet	She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “ stupid , disagreeable fellows .
Kitty Bennet	XXXIX . It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ---- , in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet ’s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ’s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room upstairs .
Kitty Bennet	Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by - the - bye , Mrs. Forster and me are _ such _ friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come :
Kitty Bennet	Not a soul knew of it , but Colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked !
Kitty Bennet	” With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ’s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .
Kitty Bennet	Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ’s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . “ Oh , Mary , ” said she , “ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .
Kitty Bennet	Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well .
Kitty Bennet	In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before .
Kitty Bennet	The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty .
Kitty Bennet	Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ’s last letter she had prepared her for such a step .
Kitty Bennet	She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other many weeks .
Kitty Bennet	you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . ” “ Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .
Kitty Bennet	Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .
Kitty Bennet	Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .
Kitty Bennet	Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill .
Kitty Bennet	“ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .
Kitty Bennet	It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . ” “ It may do very well for the others , ” replied Mr. Bingley ; “ but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .
Kitty Bennet	Wo n’t it , Kitty
Kitty Bennet	Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .
Kitty Bennet	In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , “ Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . ”
Mrs. Hurst	Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
Mrs. Hurst	Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs. Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ’s conversation with Miss Bennet .
Mrs. Hurst	At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself .
Mrs. Hurst	“ I did not know that you intended to walk , ” said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .
Mrs. Hurst	“ You used us abominably ill , ” answered Mrs. Hurst , “ running away without telling us that you were coming out . ”
Mrs. Hurst	Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .
Anne de Bourgh	I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .
Anne de Bourgh	His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart .
Anne de Bourgh	When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both .
Anne de Bourgh	Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly : her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs. Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .
Anne de Bourgh	Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime .
Anne de Bourgh	Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed . Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .
Anne de Bourgh	Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino
Anne de Bourgh	Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ’s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .
Anne de Bourgh	And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .
Anne de Bourgh	I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .
Anne de Bourgh	She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne ’s .
Anne de Bourgh	Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ”
Anne de Bourgh	She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
Anne de Bourgh	He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases .
Anne de Bourgh	, it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it ; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ’
Anne de Bourgh	“ ‘ After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
Anne de Bourgh	While in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends -- to his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh ?
Anne de Bourgh	If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh .
Anne de Bourgh	My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .
Anne de Bourgh	Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ?
Anne de Bourgh	Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
Anne de Bourgh	I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ’s infamous elopement .
Anne de Bourgh	I know it all ; that the young man ’s marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expense of your father and uncle .
Anne de Bourgh	Is _ her _ husband , who is the son of his late father ’s steward , to be his brother ?
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely -- more , I think , than last year .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr. Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Elizabeth could but just _ affect _ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen ’s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr. Darcy they had
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them : anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs. Collins ’s pretty friend had , moreover , caught his fancy very much .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	_ His _ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her Ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out,-- “ What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?
Colonel Fitzwilliam	What is it you are talking of ?
Colonel Fitzwilliam	What are you telling Miss Bennet ?
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ We were talking of music , madam , ” said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	It is of all subjects my delight .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ I assure you , madam , ” he replied , “ that she does not need such advice .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson ’s room .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	He drew a chair near her .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ’s countenance .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile , and said,-- “ You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ I shall not say that you are mistaken , ” he replied , “ because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , “ Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ I am not afraid of you , ” said he , smilingly .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of
Colonel Fitzwilliam	, ” cried Colonel Fitzwilliam .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ You shall hear , then -- but prepare for something very dreadful .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ?
Colonel Fitzwilliam	He danced only four dances !
Colonel Fitzwilliam	I am sorry to pain you , but so it was .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?
Colonel Fitzwilliam	My fingers wait your orders . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ” said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ I can answer your question , ” said Fitzwilliam , “ without applying to him .
Lady Lucas	Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ’s beauty .
Lady Lucas	She was of great use and comfort to us all , and Lady Lucas has been very kind : she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . ” “ She had better have stayed at home , ” cried Elizabeth : “ perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one ’s neighbours .
Mrs. Gardiner	At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs. Reynolds replied , that he was ; adding , “ But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ He is now gone into the army , ” she added ; “ but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ And that , ” said Mrs. Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , “ is my master -- and very like him .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I have heard much of your master ’s fine person , ” said Mrs. Gardiner , looking at the picture ; “ it is a handsome face .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Reynolds ’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .
Mrs. Gardiner	Elizabeth coloured , and said , “ A little . ” “ And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma’am ? ” “ Yes , very handsome . ” “ I am sure _ I _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .
Mrs. Gardiner	This room was my late master ’s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? ” said Mr. Gardiner .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mr. Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks : Mrs. Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . “ Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Not so much as I could wish , sir : but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Yes , sir ; but I do not know when _ that _ will be .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled .
Mrs. Gardiner	Elizabeth could not help saying , “ It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	Her keenest attention was awakened : she longed to hear more ; and was grateful to her uncle for saying,-- “ There are very few people of whom so much can be said .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Yes , sir , I know I am .
Mrs. Gardiner	Elizabeth almost stared at her .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ His father was an excellent man , ” said Mrs. Gardiner .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point .
Mrs. Gardiner	She related the subjects of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture in vain .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mr. Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ He is the best landlord , and the best master , ” said she , “ that ever lived .
Mrs. Gardiner	Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw anything of it .
Mrs. Gardiner	To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ’s delight , when she should enter the room .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ And this is always the way with him , ” she added .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ’s lifetime .
Mrs. Gardiner	The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
Mrs. Gardiner	Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs. Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Mrs. Gardiner	their progress was slow , for Mr. Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Mrs. Gardiner	That he was _ surprised _ by the connection was evident : he sustained it , however , with fortitude : and , so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Mrs. Gardiner	It originated in Mrs. Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ’s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ’s .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Mrs. Gardiner	They soon outstripped the others ; and when they had reached the carriage , Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .
Mrs. Gardiner	On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner ’s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ From what we have seen of him , ” continued Mrs. Gardiner , “ I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham .
Mrs. Gardiner	I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .
Mrs. Gardiner	But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and _ that _ , in the eye of a servant , comprehends every virtue . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned : but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of anything else .
Mrs. Gardiner	Fatigued as she had been by the morning ’s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years ’ discontinuance .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ And do you really know all this ? ” cried Mrs. Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips ,
Mrs. Gardiner	was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces .
Mrs. Gardiner	Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .
Mrs. Gardiner	They had frequently been staying with her in town .
Mrs. Gardiner	The first part of Mrs. Gardiner ’s business , on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .
Mrs. Gardiner	done , she had a less active part to play .
Mrs. Gardiner	It became her turn to listen .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I do not blame Jane , ” she continued , “ for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could .
Mrs. Gardiner	The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .
Mrs. Gardiner	I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .
Mrs. Gardiner	It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .
Mrs. Gardiner	However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ’s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and , in compassion to her nieces , turned the conversation .
Mrs. Gardiner	When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , ” said she .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I am sorry it went off .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I hope , ” added Mrs. Gardiner , “ that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .
Mrs. Gardiner	My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?
Mrs. Gardiner	on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth ’s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .
Mrs. Gardiner	Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
Mrs. Gardiner	To Mrs. Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .
Mrs. Gardiner	About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged .
Mrs. Gardiner	They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ’s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring . Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well .
Mrs. Gardiner	Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ’s visit in Gracechurch Street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ’s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ But , my dear Elizabeth , ” she added , “ what sort of girl is Miss King ?
Mrs. Gardiner	I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?
Mrs. Gardiner	Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ” “ If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . ” “ She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Oh , if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better .
Mrs. Gardiner	I am sick of them all .
Mrs. Gardiner	Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , ” said Mrs. Gardiner ; “ but perhaps , to the Lakes . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ My aunt , ” she continued , “ is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I did not think Caroline in spirits , ” were her words , “ but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .
Mrs. Gardiner	I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .
Mrs. Gardiner	I inquired after their brother , of course .
Mrs. Gardiner	I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner : I wish I could see her .
Mrs. Gardiner	My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out .
Mrs. Gardiner	I dare say I shall soon see them here .
Mrs. Gardiner	She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ’s inattention .
Mrs. Gardiner	After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and , yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .
Mrs. Gardiner	The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- “ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me .
Mrs. Gardiner	I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon .
Mrs. Gardiner	Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .
Mrs. Gardiner	All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner ; and , after relating the circumstances , she thus went on:--“I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .
Mrs. Gardiner	My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .
Mrs. Gardiner	Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .
Mr. Gardiner	He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river ; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .
Mr. Gardiner	“ But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . ”
Mr. Gardiner	Two days after Mr. Bennet ’s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , “ I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ What do you mean , Hill ?
Mr. Gardiner	“ Dear madam , ” cried Mrs. Hill , in great astonishment , “ do n’t you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner ?
Mr. Gardiner	They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast - room ; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said,-- “ If you are looking for my master , ma’am , he is walking towards the little copse .
Mr. Gardiner	/ “ My dear Brother , “ At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction .
Mr. Gardiner	Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .
Mr. Gardiner	All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .
Mr. Gardiner	These are conditions which , considering everything , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .
Mr. Gardiner	I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .
Mr. Gardiner	“ Can it be possible that he will marry her ? ”
Mr. Gardiner	I am only ashamed of his asking so little . ”
Mr. Gardiner	Yet he is _ such _ a man . ”
Mr. Gardiner	Mr. Bennet made no answer ; and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .
Mr. Gardiner	That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !
Mr. Gardiner	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ” replied Jane , “ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .
Mr. Gardiner	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ” said Elizabeth , “ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .
Mr. Gardiner	His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .
Mr. Gardiner	It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .
Mr. Gardiner	They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .
Mr. Gardiner	“ May we take my uncle ’s letter to read to her ? ” “ Take whatever you like , and get away . ” Elizabeth took the letter from his writing - table , and they went upstairs together .
Mr. Gardiner	Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .
Mr. Gardiner	Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself .
Mr. Gardiner	As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner ’s hope of Lydia ’s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .
Mr. Gardiner	My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything .
Mr. Gardiner	Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill .
Mr. Gardiner	Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner ’s behaviour laid them all under .
Mr. Gardiner	“ For we must attribute this happy conclusion , ” she added , “ in a great measure to his kindness .
Mr. Gardiner	We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ Well , ” cried her mother , “ it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?
Mr. Gardiner	If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents .
Mr. Gardiner	She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted . One day ’s delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual .
Mr. Gardiner	here comes Hill .
Mr. Gardiner	My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?
Mr. Gardiner	Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding .
Mr. Gardiner	Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy .
Mr. Gardiner	“ Well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone .
Mr. Gardiner	luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ’ time , and then we all set out .
